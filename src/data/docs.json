    "title": "Leverage of change : social housing in Tijuana, México",
    "abstract": "As a town that has heavy migration, Tijuana is in constant need of social housing for its lower income families. The demands of the population have created an overload on the government, and some third parties have begun addressing the housing issues. A study was carried out on two different types of social housing organizations that have presence in Mexico. An analysis of their policies and objectives, along with a brief statement of their purpose and creation accompanies the study. Surveys and interviews were conducted on-site with inhabitants from both projects, INFONAVIT and Habitat for Humanity. The former is government sponsored and the latter is funded by an international non- profit organization; these are factors that influence the magnitude and impact of their programs. Their relevance and pertinence to the socioeconomic group that they serve is reflected through architectural modifications that the dwellers make in their houses. An economic analysis of costs for the modifications yields a perspective of the beneficiaries' space needs and priorities. The results from the surveys show that inhabitants modify their homes with simple upgrades; those who do not have modifications plan to carry them out in the future. They have concerns for security and aesthetics. Although these constructions are built with the economic factor in mind, the owners always upgrade their houses for the sake of comfort, and they express their willingness to pay more for the constructions, if it guarantees them improved architectural finishes. In the final part of the thesis some suggestions and proposals are made in the interest of improving design standards and living conditions in the constructions that these social organizations produce; suggestions are also made for future adaptability of the base models that are built by each of the organizations under scrutiny.",

Less than fifteen miles from New York City, the Township of Bloomfield was first settled by the Dutch in 1691 and later by the English in 1719. In 1812, the State of New Jersey finally incorporated Bloomfield as a township. Until then, it had been a parish of the city of Newark. The Township took its name from the Bloomfield Presbyterian Church. This church was named for General Joseph Bloomfield, the fourth Governor of New Jersey and the first Governor to be born in New Jersey Bloomfield prides itself on its rich historical background. In 1830, a town resident David Oakes established a woolen mill. This mill prospered and provided employment for hundreds of immigrants and among its various materials, uniforms for the Union Army in the Civil War. In addition, the Township housed many military leaders including General George Washington during the American Revolution. Moreover, the community's Green functioned as a military training ground during the war. Today, it remains among the most attractive features of Bloomfield. The Township Green and its surrounding buildings, including the Oakes' mansion, which is now used as a performing arts center, have been recognized as a historic district. In 1945, the Bethany United Presbyterian Church purchased a tract of property from the Township of Bloomfield. Like Bloomfield, this church has a meaningful history. Though the construction of the church building itself began in 1945, the church as a congregation became established years earlier. Its original meeting place was a local storefront just up the street of the now existing church. In 1947, the Bethany congregation marched down the street to its present location. It was a very ceremonial event that marked years of planning, prayer, hard work, and the faith of church leaders and members alike. In expressing the church's interest in obtaining the land, Reverend William H. Neebe, on behalf of Bethany's Board of Trustees wrote to the Bloomfield Town Council, \"We believe that as a church we are rendering a public service to the community Our only reason for existence is for service to the town and community... .Anything that aids the church enhances the opportunity that the church has to serve the community.\"",

    "abstract": "Trees, when used as structural elements in their natural, round form, are up to five times stronger than the largest piece of dimensioned lumber they could yield. Additionally, these whole-timbers have a lower effective embodied carbon than any other structural material. When combined into efficient structural configurations and joined using specially-engineered connections, whole-timber has the potential to replace entire steel and concrete structural systems in large-scale buildings, bridges, and infrastructure. Whole-timber may be the most appropriate structural solution for a low-carbon and fully renewable future in both developed temperate regions and the developing Global South. To reduce barriers to adoption, including project complexity and cost, a standardized \"kit of parts\" in whole-timber is proposed. This thesis proposes new designs for the first and most important element of this kit: a structurally independent column in whole-timber. A 20' compound column in whole-timber is prototyped at full-scale. New, simple calculation methods are developed for estimating the buckling capacity of tapered timbers. Based on conservative assumptions, the embodied carbon of whole-timber column systems is shown to be between 30% and 70% lower than conventional steel systems.",

    "title": "To discover Hashima Island",
    "abstract": "From 1916 to 1945, Japanese governments recruited Korean laborers from South Korea for coal mining. The laborers ranged from thirteen to nineteen years old-most of them were still middle school or high school students. Hoping to earn money as the government promised, but unaware of the hostility and danger to which they would be exposed, 600 young Korean laborers were sent to an island called Hashima Island. Hashima Island has been desolate since 1974 after its coal resources were depleted. Although the island is no longer in use, the current condition of the architecture of Hashima Island speaks the truth of the history. The perimeter of the island is surrounded by walls; the laborers were never able to escape the hostile situation nor had a chance look at the world outside of the island. The wall is composed of three different layers: pre-cast concrete, rocks, and noise barrier; the wall as a whole is three-meters thick. Although the physical distance between the interior and exterior of the island is only three meters, the historical distance stopped in the thickness of the wall. The wall, which is the most problematic yet potentially useful component of the island, has to be interrupted architecturally in order to re-vitalize the timeline of the Korean laborers. My thesis is to reveal the neglected and hidden histories of Korean forced laborers in Hashima Island through intervention upon the existing walls. By creating an outdoor city museum by transforming the wall, the architecture of the island is re-discovered.

    "text": "To discover Hashima Island From 1916 to 1945, Japanese governments recruited Korean laborers from South Korea for coal mining. The laborers ranged from thirteen to nineteen years old-most of them were still middle school or high school students. Hoping to earn money as the government promised, but unaware of the hostility and danger to which they would be exposed, 600 young Korean laborers were sent to an island called Hashima Island. Hashima Island has been desolate since 1974 after its coal resources were depleted. Although the island is no longer in use, the current condition of the architecture of Hashima Island speaks the truth of the history. The perimeter of the island is surrounded by walls; the laborers were never able to escape the hostile situation nor had a chance look at the world outside of the island. The wall is composed of three different layers: pre-cast concrete, rocks, and noise barrier; the wall as a whole is three-meters thick. Although the physical distance between the interior and exterior of the island is only three meters, the historical distance stopped in the thickness of the wall. The wall, which is the most problematic yet potentially useful component of the island, has to be interrupted architecturally in order to re-vitalize the timeline of the Korean laborers. My thesis is to reveal the neglected and hidden histories of Korean forced laborers in Hashima Island through intervention upon the existing walls. By creating an outdoor city museum by transforming the wall, the architecture of the island is re-discovered. The wall is punctured, chiseled, carved, and shaped to create an episodic and linear path along the wall and to be in communication with the surrounding water, mountains, and ultimately the users. The wall allows water to overflow into the site, delineating the lowest topography, and provides access to the underground basement dormitories of the Korean laborers.

Many t-shelter designs do not cater to all the needs of their inhabitants and are only functional in the short term, often leaving many people relying on t-shelters for housing in an unsafe and unsanitary environment. This thesis addresses the problem of people needing housing and of unsafe transitional housing by presenting a new design process and ultimately a t-shelter design specifically for the victims of the 2015 earthquakes in Nepal in the Kathmandu area. The process involves three key elements; identifying the specific needs of the displaced people, analyzing what materials and labor are available and ensuring that the shelter will be used as intended and therefore remain safe. The resulting shelter design harnesses the structural strength of the geodesic dome, the simplicity of reciprocal joinery and strong yet lightweight nature of bamboo. The effectiveness of the proposed new design process is demonstrated through checking the resulting shelter design meeting measurable outcomes like cost, structural integrity and skill level required to construct.",

    "abstract": "This thesis investigates the factors that have caused changes in church sanctuary design in Harrison County, Iowa in the last century, focusing on daylight and thermal qualities. Most of the churches in the county today were built in the Gothic and Romanesque Revival styles between 1880 and 1930, before the era of active climate control. Cultural, historic, and aesthetic factors, as well as the available heating technology, shaped the original design of each church. As the ability to heat and cool interior spaces became more advanced, expectations of comfort changed and design priorities shifted. To understand the effects of changes in design and their likely motivation, case studies of the Missouri Valley Church of Christ and the Logan Christian Church were done, two churches built in the early 20* century and remodeled extensively in the middle of the century. These case studies included daylight simulations and thermal calculations. In general, in the post-renovation condition these churches had less illuminance throughout the year, somewhat less glare, and much less energy lost to conduction and ventilation. In the context of other area churches, it seems likely that new churches built in this county will have less glazing, overhangs to control overheating in the summer, and greater care taken when siting the church.",

    "abstract": "While architecture inherently makes sound when people and the environment interact with it, architects seldom orchestrate a building to produce sound. This thesis proposes a sonic facade that turns an existing building into a sound producing instrument. Sonic facade is a wind powered sound producing device that can be integrated into a wall structure. The facade is produced out of a series tubes, or more technically, a series of air column vibrators. While all the tubes may be the same length, the combination of three different types of tubes produces different sounds. This thesis proposes a seven rule shape grammar for users to determine the placement and implementation of the sonic facade on an existing building and site. The shape grammar allows for a range of simple to complex possibilities that could be applied to a variety of buildings. The sonic facade not only has an aural quality, but it is also an indicator and transmitter of the outside world. When the tubes pass from the outside to the inside of a building, the wind, the rain, and passersby bring sound inside the building.",

    "abstract": "This urban design thesis addresses the transformation of single-use industrial space to mixed-use public and private space, linking pedestrian and vehicular paths within the village of Sussex, WI. The industrial revolution often reinforced the separation of functions (residential, commercial, industrial, civic) into separate buildings and often separate districts. In the midst of the built landscape, former places of industrial work and production are now large tracts of underused land. The reappropriation of urban and suburban industrial space provides the opportunity to create mixed-use, vital spaces relating well to pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Such reappropriation deals with the site not only visually, but also in terms of the way its history and natural processes are transformed. The reappropriation is essential on the urban scale of a village, and I choose to explore it at the site of the former quarry and canning factory in Sussex, WI. As a central link between Main Street and the pedestrian Bugline trail, the six acre urban landscape design (in several phases) includes over 100,000 indoor square feet of residential, commercial, and public spaces. This thesis examines issues of ownership, financing, phasing, landscaping, and architecture as they apply in the village. Through an urban design analysis and a series of schemes in drawings and models, the process shows the role of natural processes and public sector involvement in the site development, along with creative solutions to address these relationships on the site. It uses the prominent scale and location of former industrial land and spaces as a point of departure for improving a location's sense of local character, its local economy, its neighborhoods, and its public space.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the benefits of adding natural fiber tensile reinforcement to aerated concrete. Concrete is a great composite material which can be created in various proportions and with various materials to alter its strength, density and porosity, amongst other properties. Concrete which is used commonly in construction of columns, beams, and slabs acts well in compression but fails under tension. The common solution is to reinforce the structure in areas where it experiences tension with steel. There are other materials besides steel which also take tension well. Natural fibers for example come in various strengths and types and would create lighter and perhaps more sustainable beam designs. Natural fibers have been used for their availability, workability, and high tensile strengths for centuries. This research discovers how the natural fibers distribute within the mixture and how they affect the aeration of the concrete, as well as how they affect the strength. Multiple samples are cured with different fiber types and in different proportions within the mixture. Furthermore, similar experimentation is conducted to discover an ideal ratio of aggregate to aerated concrete mix. The aggregate gives the concrete greater strength and economy, but could negatively affect the aeration. The various concrete mixes are poured and allowed to cure to maximum strength before indirect tensile tests and compression tests are conducted. The effects of creating smooth aerated concrete molds are also investigated. All experiments conducted are precursory to an ultimate tensile reinforced aerated concrete beam design with an aggregate mix and smooth surfaces.",

Using water as a tool for form-finding in landscape design fosters a sense of awareness of the relationship and interaction between people, water and the land.

This thesis explores the dialogue between experience and performance -- the reciprocity between form and function -- through the design of a performative landscape that re-interprets the water treatment cycle as an architectural medium in an urban setting. The groundscape topology curates a gradated ecological agenda that, over time, transforms the seamless and the uniform to a cellularized non-uniformity. This physical transformation, along with the integration of geometric scale and rates of change, informs a social program by creating public pools as a 'destination' for the water that is drained through the landscape surface.

This thesis proposes to question received notions of glass as a transparent material and instead focus on its possibilities as a reflective material. The thesis is an exploration of a specific material property, reflectivity, and the effects it has on architecture in terms of experiencing a space and defining a space and redefining perceptions of one's self within space. Architectural projects often draw from materials and their specific properties to create certain forms or types of spaces. Reflectivity as a material property operates on the extreme end of the spectrum of transparency. Transparency is a way of introducing layers of space and juxtaposing spaces on top of one another. Reflectivity, on the other hand, has the special property of recreating an image almost exactly but one that is dependent as an effect on the actual eye of the viewer. The location of the viewer in relation to a space and a mirrored surface becomes a relationship that can be highly controlled to create a specific effect or experience. The geometry of the mirrored surface and the geometry of the space being reflected can also be carefully controlled and designed to produce particular effects. Mirrors are unique in that they provide an opportunity where spatial relationships may not be as solidly defined as what is normally experienced. The architecture latent within the reflected image of a mirrored surface can appear to operate under its own laws of physics. There can be an ambiguous quality to a space that detracts from the more concrete materialization of the architecture.

The relationship between body and architecture is challenged by the demands and desires for adaptability and interactivity, however material and construction methods of architecture have changed little to address these concerns.

Architectural elements are enabled with flexibility and mutability, in terms of its skin and program, which are activated by the user. The first investigation explores three joints within the body and documents, analyses and transforms these joints into an architectural abstraction. Then the concept of collapsed and interactive skin is applied to a design proposal for the fagade for the Art Interactive Gallery. The fagade engages pedestrians visually as well as physically. The final component of the thesis redefines the program of a fitting room as a physically transformable and socially interactive fagade condition activated by the body's own movements. Throughout the research, the thesis has focused on the process of manipulating materials to create composite skin and structural conditions to further investigate the relationship between the body and architecture.",

    "abstract": "The spectrum of mental and emotional health is broad, as are the causes and the variables within one's environment, relationships, and day to day activities. However, one's physical environment can significantly affect how they sleep, work, and interact with others- especially on college campuses where many do all of those things in the same spaces. In order to find applicable and specific effects of architecture on mental health, this thesis will focus on depression and anxiety. The goal is to find out if there are relatively low-cost, non-infrastructural changes that can be made to study and lounge spaces to minimize the environmental triggers for depression and anxiety and induce activities and habits that promote an emotionally healthy lifestyle. This raises a couple of questions both about architectural design and mental health: 1. Can the layout and design of a space affect how people act and feel within that space? 2. What types of spacial and personal interactions are emotionally and mentally healthy? 3. What are some environmental triggers for depression and anxiety? 4. How can a room's layout and overall atmosphere be altered to provide a mentally healthy space? 5. What are the purposes of various spaces on a campus, and are they designed for such? The purpose of this thesis is to answer the questions above in order to understand the connections between architecture and mental health and use that understanding to design the \"optimal space\" for a university member to rest or work (while maintaining their mental health). This thesis will use precedent studies, interviews, observations, surveys and an installation to investigate ways in which mental health is currently being considered in the design process, as well as how we can bridge the gap between design and psychological needs. This thesis will then provide a series of findings about spatial aspects that most affect mental health, as well as measures that one can take to improve mental health and recommendations about how this can be incorporated into the design of public lounges and study spaces at MIT.",

Additionally, my project focuses on how buildings can be designed to naturally condition the indoor environments of our buildings. More specifically, I would like to help architects discover how they can utilize natural ventilation effectively. Using the TRNSYS simulation environment, I methodically show how a designer would use TRNSYS to make informed decisions about natural ventilation in their designs.

Many cemeteries, once sited at the edge of cities and towns, are now surrounded by urban sprawl and development of surrounding land.

Development and exploitation of land has resulted in the fracturing of a sacred environment in urban cemeteries, and some cemeteries have been displaced in the pursuit of developing land.

Cremation is beginning to precede over burial for economic and practical reasons, and the rituals of death are becoming less personal. This thesis will address these issues through the critique and design of a new extension for the Blue Hill Cemetery, in Braintree. The process of design will consist of two investigations: the initial design of a crematory complex and burial ground, and an exploration of natural and artificial light in the complex's structures. The latter investigation is conducted through computer modeling, and it will also explore the computer's potential as a design tool. The first design investigation will recognize the pressures of the urban condition surrounding the old cemetery. An informed response is required-one that recognizes past and present uses of the site as well as the need to redefine the cemetery as a sacred space.

Along with long established tactics on the consumption side of the production equation -- namely collective housing and collective purchasing -- a new form of economic autonomy is emerging from within the very tool-kit of Neoliberalism. Due to its vastly smaller scale and increased productivity, minimal environmental impact, and rapidly decreasing costs, automation technologies provide opportunity for collective ownership of joint factories. Here, the vast array of skilled middle-class workers can converge to share a base system of advanced production, consequently renewing their economic competitiveness. While individually the three forms of collective action might only require a diffuse spatialization, or no collocation whatsoever, the combination of all three collective strategies within the same spatial container suggests a potentially new form of living, one which goes beyond the simple abutting of live/work spaces, to the definition of a total life-world. To mediate this complexity I have appropriated a subtle archi-tectonic device, the plenum, as the infrastructure that simultaneously buffers and connects the two typically disparate worlds of material work and social re-production. The plenum does this by providing a flexible super-structure for services, people, and material to pass through, for program to attach to and utilize for its own specificity, and as a zone of mediation which allows spaces of industry and living to collide. With the collective control over these new spaces of both simple reproduction and extended production, founded on the appropriation of advanced forms of automated production, my thesis proposes the return to older modes of communal living and resilience through co-production and co-habitation, and hence the rebirth of the collective life-world. This design project is a first step in envisioning a new, American middle-class polis, defined here as the prior definition of a social and political form of existence.

    "abstract": "The possibility of becoming lost is always present, as far away as another country or as close as your own body. When truly lost, there is at first, an examining of the unfamiliar, then a quick check-in with what we know. In a way, becoming lost is a way of finding what we know. It seems that when we are off-course, we become hyper-aware of our surroundings, scanning to find out what appears to be going on. We ask, why is this happening in this way, and how is it different from what I know? Leaving the realms of what we know by going to unfamiliar spaces allows us to become more present in our immediate situation. In my work I am searching for ways of inviting this condition. Looking for a Landscape, my final work at MIT, takes as its site an ordinary object from an urban space.

    "text": "Getting lost and looking for a landscape The possibility of becoming lost is always present, as far away as another country or as close as your own body. When truly lost, there is at first, an examining of the unfamiliar, then a quick check-in with what we know. In a way, becoming lost is a way of finding what we know. It seems that when we are off-course, we become hyper-aware of our surroundings, scanning to find out what appears to be going on. We ask, why is this happening in this way, and how is it different from what I know? Leaving the realms of what we know by going to unfamiliar spaces allows us to become more present in our immediate situation. In my work I am searching for ways of inviting this condition. Looking for a Landscape, my final work at MIT, takes as its site an ordinary object from an urban space.

This thesis turns its attention and design focus toward the integration of more conventional architectural concerns of skyscraper design and towards the elaboration of the high density framework that follows from it.

It is further my opinion that in the past, in a time when the \"individual\" was more directly involved, better able and more willing to take part in affecting the shaping of our environment, through the craft of building, the quality of \"meaning\" of which I speak was achieved as a natural by-product of this process. Because of this integration the meaning and quality of a place was better perceived \"commonly\" or generally by the larger public audience. The users felt more directly connected to the environment in which they lived. As the \"individual\" was removed from the process of creation and construction his absence was perceivable in the product of those activities, our built environment. As a result our spaces and places for living, our architecture, became more and more removed from the collective experience, more barren, less related to, or grounded in, the human experience and the human functions they were to support. The results were that the places we live in, work in, play in, were perceived as, and thereby often became, alienating and cold. The fact is, that while in many cases our newly constructed physical boundaries or objects, their functions, and their activities were still as the old, the places did not work nor do they work today. They work neither at all, or, as well as one might expect if evaluating only their physical elements. It is the intention of this thesis to attempt to analyze and describe the process, the ways in which meaning can be designed into or added to the environment and its architecture through acquiring an understanding of the process by which it occurs, or has occurred, naturally.

    "title": "Enabling and inhibiting urban development : a case study of Lahore Improvement Trust as a late colonial institution",
    "abstract": "This thesis examines the Lahore Improvement Trust in relation to the urban development of the city of Lahore in mid-twentieth century. LIT was responsible for most major urban development in the city from 1936 up until 1975, when it metamorphosed into the Lahore Development Authority. However, its impact on Lahore's urban history is surprisingly under-recognized, and this may be due to the relative failure of the body itself in delivering a large part of its mandate, despite being responsible for major morphological changes in the city. The formation of LIT, like other Improvement Trusts in India, was based on a real need for planned urban development of a rapidly expanding city. This thesis argues that the structure of such a body was, however, based on conceptual frameworks that were introduced in India by numerous different British institutions, with the aim of either 'testing out' or for furthering a particular colonial agenda. These inherent structural beliefs were carried through numerous cycles of 'reform' before being applied onto the Improvement Trust network which, this study argues, followed a strict path dependent paradigm in a late colonial institution such as LIT. Using the annual reports of LIT, I show that this was evident in the modus operandi of the body, to the point that despite being able to implement individual projects that can be considered successful to a certain extent, it failed to develop or implement a coherent urban vision. Projects under LIT were fragmented instances in the larger urban morphology of the city, which failed to respond to the more pressing problems in the city. Its failure to register itself as a viable body was further exacerbated by the body's incapability to deal with issues such as housing shortage in the city. This was particularly evident in the face of a major shock as Partition in 1947. A huge influx of migrants from East Punjab and riots within the city that caused major infrastructural damage within the city meant that the deficit of the body carried itself exponentially beyond the event of Partition in 1947. That the Trust exhibited institutional inertia well beyond the Partition in its mode of operating explains the weak progress it made beyond that event, and its eventual dissolution into Lahore Development Authority in 1975.

    "text": "Enabling and inhibiting urban development : a case study of Lahore Improvement Trust as a late colonial institution This thesis examines the Lahore Improvement Trust in relation to the urban development of the city of Lahore in mid-twentieth century. LIT was responsible for most major urban development in the city from 1936 up until 1975, when it metamorphosed into the Lahore Development Authority. However, its impact on Lahore's urban history is surprisingly under-recognized, and this may be due to the relative failure of the body itself in delivering a large part of its mandate, despite being responsible for major morphological changes in the city. The formation of LIT, like other Improvement Trusts in India, was based on a real need for planned urban development of a rapidly expanding city. This thesis argues that the structure of such a body was, however, based on conceptual frameworks that were introduced in India by numerous different British institutions, with the aim of either 'testing out' or for furthering a particular colonial agenda. These inherent structural beliefs were carried through numerous cycles of 'reform' before being applied onto the Improvement Trust network which, this study argues, followed a strict path dependent paradigm in a late colonial institution such as LIT. Using the annual reports of LIT, I show that this was evident in the modus operandi of the body, to the point that despite being able to implement individual projects that can be considered successful to a certain extent, it failed to develop or implement a coherent urban vision. Projects under LIT were fragmented instances in the larger urban morphology of the city, which failed to respond to the more pressing problems in the city. Its failure to register itself as a viable body was further exacerbated by the body's incapability to deal with issues such as housing shortage in the city. This was particularly evident in the face of a major shock as Partition in 1947. A huge influx of migrants from East Punjab and riots within the city that caused major infrastructural damage within the city meant that the deficit of the body carried itself exponentially beyond the event of Partition in 1947. That the Trust exhibited institutional inertia well beyond the Partition in its mode of operating explains the weak progress it made beyond that event, and its eventual dissolution into Lahore Development Authority in 1975. Hence, while most projects implemented by the Trust were moderately successful, the lack of a holistic urban plan, a result of both structural (internal) and situational (external) problems, was where LIT failed to deliver causing it to leave an ineffectual mark on Lahore's urban history."

    "title": "Rethinking streets : urban life with autonomous vehicles",
    "abstract": "Historically, streets have served a range of functions, primarily those associated with traffic circulation and social interaction. However, in the 20th century, the street design became centered on traffic movement and maximum space for automobiles, while public lives were marginalized to narrow sidewalks. Contemporary urban planners and designers have acknowledged that both livability and efficiency are indispensable components to a city's sustainable development. However, to achieve them both is a difficult task with the conventional dominance of automobiles. This thesis explores the mutual influence of urban design and transport technology, and offers a solution to rethink streets as urban surfaces, which integrate traffic infrastructure and the public realm with the application of shared autonomous vehicles. The thesis presents a new design paradigm based on a three-prong approach: 1) design of shared surfaces for pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles as a continuous public living room; and (2) inclusion of efficient surfaces that provide dedicated space for shared vehicles and cyclists to collect and distribute people at a faster speed; and (3) inclusion of the transition zone between shared surfaces and efficient surfaces. Another feature of this thesis is a new approach to the design of these autonomous vehicles that combines the self-driving technology of autonomous vehicles with new robotic features that tell vehicles when to reduce speed to share surfaces with pedestrians, and when to resume speed on dedicated surfaces. Using South Boston Waterfront as a case study, the thesis shows that cities do not have to remain under the dominance of vehicles; and that urban life can gain new spatial integrity that serves the needs of people and, at the same time, responds to the realities of urban mobility.",

    "abstract": "This thesis addresses design strategies for the future development of drosscapes in urban regions and their relation with the city at large, having as an example the district of Eleonas in Athens, Greece. It provides answers to the problems of the district and understands the drosscape as a potential for the urban revitalization of the city of Athens. The design proposal is primarily concerned with the urban transformation of the drosscape, and not its ecological reclamation. To do so, the proposal focuses in multiple scales of analysis and proposals. The city of Athens experienced rapid growth during the 1950s due to its rapid urbanization and the rise of industry. These activities had their impact in the organization of the city and its development. During the post-industrial era the areas that were previously formed, have been used for other emerging economic activities, however their role and their relation with the city remain problematic until today. Having as an example the area of Eleonas, this thesis will address the role of drosscapes inside the city and propose an alternative urban strategy for their future development. Eleonas is a huge area covering approximately 2.350 acres. It is located within walking distance from the historical center of Athens, while at the same time it is the biggest undeveloped piece of land in the city. The district today is characterized by its problematic mobility infrastructure, the severe environmental pollution problems, the accumulation of incompatible land uses and its unresolved relation with the downtown of Athens. This thesis aims to recognize and strengthen the urban identities that have emerged in the area since it was an agricultural land. It is an alternative solution to the ongoing urban sprawl to the east part of Athens by bringing more inhabitants in Eleonas and designing mixed uses, urban communities. It solves the problems related to the environmental pollution of the area and creates a well-articulated mobility network which would promote public transportation. Finally, it reserves the existing road infrastructure and the buildings.",

By these reforms, Kemalist regime aimed to transform the whole society and its cultural production. While the existing transformations in the social context was already on their way to Westernization, they were appropriated and accelerated by the Republican modernization reforms. On the other hand, architectural discourse experienced more radical and abrupt transformations when modern architecture was introduced into the architectural culture: Although precedents of modern architecture existed in the pre-Republican period, the official Republican ideology incited the introduction of modern architecture into Turkey. Despite the exceptional importance given to the architectural field, usually it was the foreign architects who got the large scale commissions. This discrimination eventually created a discomfort among Turkish architects. Consequently, Turkish architects who were enthusiastic to produce modern architectural examples had been compelled to operate in the domain of residential architecture. Hence, 1930s' architectural culture experienced the intricate amalgamation formed by the interaction of contradictory ideologies such as dwelling, modernism and nationalism. In addition to the brief analyses made on the Istanbul households and the architectural discourse of the 1930s, the main aim of this study lies in the close formal readings of the residential examples built in Istanbul between the years 1931 and 1940.

    "abstract": "Shifting political, social and cultural landscapes in contemporary Cairo with the triumph of Neolibralism are defining the city's modem heritage. In order to create a narrative of transformation of architectural production and its entanglement in different social, cultural and political contexts within the city's history, I will focus on the epicenter of the modem city, wust-el-balad, Downtown. It has recently been appropriated through a dual process of asserting the city's modem heritage. The first part of this process utilizes popular media such as period-based soap operas, photography exhibitions, literature and film. The second part of the process is through preservation of Cairo's modem buildings and the drafting of legislation to protect them. Architectural style, ornamentation of frontages (facades), is central to this process of shaping 'modem' Cairo. The criteria for inclusion into this heritage as practiced by the various committees and authorities explicitly place facades and aesthetics at the top of their selection process. Thus the process of heritization is inscribing a certain image of modernity in Cairo by selective inclusion of certain architectural styles. This thesis traces the constantly shifting image of modernity throughout downtown's history from its origin in the nineteenth century to its present state in the twenty-first century.",

It is a search for those things which allow us to dwell, for things that anchor our belonging. It is a search for things which are formed from a principle which is a cultural, a historical, formed from something deep within us. Moreover it is an explanation, better still a belief about what we are about. I am not going to talk about poetry or literature per se. I will be talking about poetry as the springing point from which 1 will talk about our works. I will look at the nature of things. the things we make mediate between the earth and ourselves in some way. In each things we make we can read our relationship to the earth, or non-relationship as the case may be in our present alienating world. These things gather the earth and ourselves together and make sense by our willing. For anything to be born into the void, the distance between us and the earth there must be an idea, a thought. We concertize those images in the thing, to be anchored and made real. In creating these things we have the power to bring to the thing values we consider worthwhile. This essay will be a case for those values which allow belonging to occur, which makes dwelling possible. To return to poetry, or rather the poetic let us look at language for a time. In ordinary language we use naming to make the world understandable and precise. We can begin to communicate reality through this naming. Thus language anchors our existence and is tied to the things by this act of naming. Poetry, however, transcends this connection. It brings about meaning through the juxtaposition of different things. It creates its meaning by association and by metaphor (translation), bringing it alive in another way. It becomes a thing in itself. It stands on its own, outside of ordinary language, it mediates between reality and us. It is not tied to a thing as a name is, rather it brings earth and humanity together, it mediates just as a thing does. It becomes a living thing in its own right revealing for us the earth and us to the earth. And so to architecture that is truth, an architecture that echoes and mirrors reality, illuminates its existence and allows for dwelling. In a way this is a search for truth via the artifact. Dwelling depends on belonging which in turn depends on reality and our knowing of it, particularly as truth. I hope to show a way which lies beneath our false constructions to achieve that which has been elusive, a sense of belonging in order that I might find ground upon which I can truly build.",

    "abstract": "This thesis seeks to investigate the role of architecture in staging, broadcasting, and promoting political and social ideologies, especially as new political regimes come to power and are confronted with the monuments and built artifacts of their predecessors. This thesis is interested in how the optimistic promises of any nascent government are staged in buildings and in the city. What sites remain, are transformed, or are torn down? The story of Havana's growth in the twentieth century is directly tied to the political motivations of its leaders. While the country was free from the Spanish but not quite independent, the city grew up. Casinos, high-rise apartments and hotels captured coastal real estate through which money could be funneled to the upper echelons of the Batista regime. Along with Fidel Castro came a promise of utopia. For a brief moment, the revolution sponsored a new, experimental architectural form. The US Embargo and the fall of the Soviet Union halted Havana's growth and urbanization abruptly. This history suggests three key attitudes towards architecture as a site of politics: augmentation through additional construction, erasure of buildings in order to re-write history, and inhabitation of a building in order to reuse its infrastructure while simultaneously changing its function and image. In order to test these strategies, this thesis inserts itself in a future moment of crisis and revolution in Cuba, a moment akin to Cuba's fight for independence and to the time of Castro's rise to power. It questions the inevitability of a wave of capitalism washing over the island in the post-Castro years and instead imagines a new state-sponsored project to make Cuba 100 percent food-independent. In this future, the state witnesses the political turmoil and instability around the globe and realizes it cannot rely on foreign aid and imports to feed its people; it designs a return to its agrarian past. This thesis argues for an alternate ending to the story of Cuba's experiment with socialism. While construction was cut short due to political contingencies in the early 1960s, could there be a new experiment for the Havana of today? Can the aspiration for a collective urbanity be revived? Where will the future sites of production exist in the city? In Havana, there are pockets of vibrant life, notably in the Old City, along La Rampa, or along the Malecón. Here, glimpses of the promised socialist dream may still be visible. This thesis asks if these few social islands (or social condensers in the words of O.M. Ungers) can be saved, if they can become sites of non-capitalist production and education, and if they can help sustain Cuba into our unknown future.",

As Dresden's new congress center rises up on the bank of the Elbe between Marienbrucke bridge and the Saxon Parliament Buildings by the year 2000, Kulturpalast will be converted into a concert hall and house Dresden's Philharmonic Orchestra. This thesis focuses on the design of a new Kulturpalast as an activator of two public spaces of Dresden - Altmarkt and Neuemarkl. This is an inquiry into how this building should be shaped by its urban context, and how it should contribute to the urban character of these neighboring public spaces. Cultural activities should be brought towards the building's periphery to bring new meaning to these public spaces and to create an architectural coherence. The urban and architectural design of the concert hall complex is guided by three design principles.

At a time when climate change is having a detrimental impact on the Arctic landscape, Northern communities are on the frontline of resource development where industrial money promises major territorial and social change. In this way, the Inuvialuit population of Tuktoyaktuk will find opportunity in crisis as they strategically manipulate both the agendas of the petroleum industry as well as the federal government's own incentive for Northern development in order to construct a new coastal frontier and secure a post-oil economy defended from the rising sea. This form of oil urbanization provides an architectural and infrastructural imperative for this thesis, as change will occur rapidly and at a much larger scale than these communities could spark or manage on their own. The Tuktoyaktuk landscape will undoubtedly become transformed by the creation of occupiable, defensive infrastructure that secures new land on which to reimagine the arctic dwelling and its temporal interface with a rising sea and a changing economy. Mobilized by the demands and goals of the Inuvialuit population, this thesis examines Tuktoyaktuk as an exemplary model for strategic modernization and development of remote Arctic communities on the frontline of industrialization. The goal of designing this enhanced urban structure is to make use of the finite economic opportunity to set up the framework from which the community will thrive and grow upon the retreat of the oil operations. By maximizing the opportunities that emerge from these complexities of place, we begin to unveil a unique and timely moment for architectural and infrastructural innovation.",

    "abstract": "This thesis is an investigation of the natural or bodily-based meaning of architecture, understood in terms of the inherent qualities and relationships that arise out of movement within built environment, and based in a contemporary understanding of the relationship between man and world. This work. attempts a fundamental grounding of discussions of architectural meaning, through the rigorous application of our ever expansive knowledge base onto the realities of building and basic human understanding. Taking from environmental and perceptual psychology, and the cognitive sciences, the intent is to evolve a dialectic between science and contemporary theory that can advance our knowledge for architecture. This investigation of embodied experience revolves around two primary focal points. First, the increasing emphasis on vision and abstract objectivity has limited the range of the meaningful, and has led to a focus on abstract, intellectual meaning; this work. Attempts to demonstrate the potential that an interactive and complementary juxtaposition of kinesthetic signification could have. Second, architecture's greatest potency arises when it is considered in terms of the experience of both space and time -- specifically movement and the relationships between spaces that result from this movement.  The body may be seen as a \"paradigmatic ruler,\" a measuring tool for spatial experience, which in fact measures the spatially implicit meaning in bodily experience. Thus, this thesis is about trying to resolve the difficult juxtaposition of the transcendent qualities of embodied meaning with issues of time and movement, in order to derive an architecture fundamentally grounded in the body. The thesis surveys a cross-section of research and theory loosely categorized into three realms: embodied understanding, embodied meaning in architecture, and aesthetic issues of time and movement. The intent is to give direction to possible theories of architecture grounded in embodiment. This consideration of embodied meaning does not attempt to suggest an alternative to conscious, culturally-based meaning, nor to perpetuate the mind body split; rather the intent is to offer another frame of emphasis within our consciousness, and indicate the possibilities of the interaction and integral relationship between the intellectual and embodied realms, in designing for the modern world.

    "abstract": "This thesis explores Mies van der Rohe's Barcelona Pavilion through the lens of Nelson Goodman's philosophical categories of the autographic and the allographic in order to determine what constitutes the building's identity. The Pavilion was originally designed as a temporary structure for the 1929 International Exposition in Barcelona and rebuilt in 1986 as a permanent building. The reconstruction of this iconic building provokes a complex questioning about the identity of the Barcelona Pavilion in particular and of any architectural work in general. Goodman's notions are unique criteria to deal with issues of identity and authenticity in architecture. The autographic identifies a category of works that cannot be replicated, i.e., every difference between a work and even its closest copy makes a difference to the work's identity. In contrast, the allographic identifies a category of works that can be replicated, i.e., the difference between an original and its duplication is irrelevant to the work's identity.

    "abstract": "The American Small Industries Exhibition was the first instance during the Cold War wherein the USA assembled a solo exhibit outside the framework of an established trade fair. It toured three nonaligned nations between 1958 and 1961: India, Ghana, and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Ceylon's political climate was suffused with mounting anti-West sentiment, and the exhibition constitutes one of the few moments of sustained interaction between Ceylon and the USA. Using the exhibition's nomenclature as a provocation, this thesis examines the Small Industries Exhibition's aspirations in relation to political realities of 1960s Ceylon. Its aims were apparently clear: to support industrialisation and establish trade ties with three non-aligned, socialist-leaning nations shifting from an agricultural to an industrial economy. It was intended to serve as a clear endorsement of capitalistic modernisation, while refuting the socialist, state-centred models of development embodied in multi-year planning documents released by each of the three host countries. Descriptions of the fair, however, are contradictory and unexpected, commencing with the unusual presentation of the USA as a wellspring of small-scale industry. This thesis disassembles the exhibition into its many components, making a case for studying the very small to illuminate the very large. When examined closely, objects on view project a range of messages and betray a vast array of physical and ideological infrastructures. However, the thesis also examines the slender site of the suture - the manner in which objects and agents are assembled and deployed - not only to understand the composition of these contradictions, but also to read the act of translation. It argues that to dissect these assemblages is to peel away at the constructed line of the 'national' boundary, prompting an examination of knowledge transfers, affinities, and differences that are simultaneously local and transnational in their scope and impact. In particular, the thesis examines the fragmented, contingent, conflicting processes that are gathered together and described as modernisation, and challenges the measures used to divide the globe into 'developed' and 'developing' nations.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of city form is an issue that has been studied extensively. Typically, however, the focus has been on change rather than persistence. During the process of change, many aspects of the city are left unaltered and remnants of the past survive vividly. Furthermore, the presence of the past constrains the way new intervention is carried out. I propose the hypothesis that a city has an inertia that resists change. This inertia is distributed unevenly among urban artifacts, and a hierarchy of artifacts in terms of their rates of change can be established The latent potential or capacity of urban artifacts permits them to adapt to changes without significant alterations in their physical structure. This capacity of artifacts allows them to support functions different from the ones for which they were conceived. This quasi-autonomous nature of urban artifacts also leads one to distinguish between an internal and external history of physical urban form. The research methodology develops Conzen's \"plan units\" as a tool to analyze the morphology of plan units and their built forms. Plan units are morphological frames for the built forms within. In the occurrence of critical events however, plan units may be amalgamated, subdivided, or even removed. The thesis also focuses on the genesis, evolution, and site succession of urban artifacts. Bursa, an ancient city in the western part of Anatolia is then adopted as a case study for the theory of persistence in city form. The morphology of a selected research area is studied in the aftermath of three critical events: Ahmet Vefik Pasa's intervention, the 1956 fire, and the beginning of industrialization.",

    "abstract": "Displacement ventilation is a form of air-conditioning which provides good air quality and some energy savings. The air quality is better than for a conventional mixed ventilation system. The maximum amount of cooling that displacement ventilation can provide whilst maintaining a comfortable space is between 25 and 40 W/m2. Chilled ceilings can be added to increase the cooling capacity of the system. A scale model study was carried out to determine comfort levels at different conditions, to establish maximum cooling loads and to observe flow patterns in a typical office room with displacement ventilation and a chilled ceiling. Refrigerant R114 was used as the scaling fluid and an existing test box was used as the model room. Heat sources were simulated using electric resistances in aluminum enclosures. A gas and a water circuit were built to supply ventilation and cooling to the room. Flow visualization was carried out by injecting refrigerant laden with ammonium chloride smoke into the supply point. The smoke was lit by a spotlight shone between two pieces of cardboard and images were taken using a video camera. The results showed that for displacement ventilation alone, the temperature distribution was within stringent comfort levels for heat loads up to 25 W/m2 with an air change rate of 7.5. When a chilled ceiling was added, up to 40 W/m2 could be cooled within comfort levels. The refrigerant was radiatively absorbing, so the radiation cooling from the ceiling was reduced. Therefore, this maximum cooling load is probably an underestimate. Some displacement occurred at low levels for this cooling load, which indicated good air quality, but it was below the breathing zone. At higher loads, the flow appeared to be mixed. Therefore, the benefit of enhanced air quality with displacement ventilation was lost when a chilled ceiling was added. The use of a scale model allowed the study of ventilation systems without building a full scale room. It was of limited use for this study because the heat transfer by radiation could not be modelled correctly with this refrigerant. Further experiments could be carried out with lower supply air rates. The experiments could be improved by ensuring more accurate measurement of the water and gas flow rates and temperatures, reducing heat losses. Flow visualization could be improved by injecting smoke at different points within the room and by using a stronger, more focused plane of light. The apparatus could be used for future work on heat transfer that does not involve a significant amount of radiation. It is recommended that a more leak-tight box with a greater height is built and a more environmentally friendly refrigerant is used.",

    "abstract": "My thesis examines the urban transformation of Beirut between 1830 and 1930. Evolving from a local market city importing European goods and exporting local produce into a transit city for the re-export of European commodities, Beirut developed from a quadrilateral of thick crusader walls enclosing a labyrinth of narrow streets into a modem commercial center highlighted by the French-designed Place de l'Étoile. The new center connected the city with the port and with its hinterland through two major thoroughfares lined up with modem office buildings that, for the first time, accommodated underground storage spaces. My core questions are: What made Beirut develop in this direction? Why were the markets centered the way they were? I argue that the urban transformation of Beirut in the nineteenth century through World War I was a manifestation of a French imperial policy that had been at play a century before the French Mandate. Seeking to extend infrastructural networks, France saw Beirut, particularly through its port, as an economic base that would facilitate trade with the region. 'Beirut al- Jadida' (New Beirut) was ultimately created to provide a gateway for France to regain access into the region after an era of decline in French economic dominance in the Levant, in the wake of the Napoleonic Expedition into Egypt and Syria (1798-1801) and the abrogation of the Achelles du Levant system of trade by Ahmad Pasha Al-Jazzar (r. 1775-1804). In the second half of the nineteenth century, with the expansion of the port (1887-1890) and the construction of the carriageway (1857-1863) and railroad (1895) between Beirut and Damascus, French dominance rose once again-this time in a new political (colonial) form. The French agent intervening in the development of Beirut evolved from it being a financial investor-through private companies sponsoring the silk industry and other trades-in the early nineteenth century, to a major concession holder of various public works in the mid- to late-nineteenth century after the silk trade with the Levant had declined, to a military colonizer in the early twentieth century, when French economic dominance became a governmental pursuit no longer restricted to the operations of private businesses. My thesis seeks to explore how the change over time in economic and political activities, and in the interests of the colonizers in both the pre-colonial and colonial periods, was reflected in urban design and planning of the city. In my work, I propose a framework of analysis that sees the nineteenth- and early-twentieth- century development of Beirut as a continuous process of modernization and engagement with the international economic system in which both the Ottomans and French were invested, contrary to a significant number of scholarly works that tended to partition the city's history into two separate historical narratives tied to the two governing regimes.",

    "title": "The Architecture of Alvaro Siza",
    "abstract": "The work of the Portuguese architect Alvaro Siza (1933), as it developed during the 1970's is an intriguing and dense expression of several contemporary concerns. The thesis focuses on three of Siza's works, the Antonio Carlos Siza house (1976-78), the projects for Kreuzberg commissioned by the International Building Exhibition of Berlin (1979), and the plan for the Malagueira district at Evora (1977- present). The analysis of these projects and Siza's few writings and statements is undertaken in an effort to tentatively articulate the principles which lie behind the forms of his architecture. From the analysis of specific works, two themes, thought to be central to Siza's enterprise, are identified and applied to a wider range of works. This inquiry does not provide a comprehensive account of Siza's ongoing research program. It does suggest a way of approaching the work, and provides a means of placing Siza's architecture within the context of Portuguese architectural culture and the current architectural debate.",

They were also critical in the city's history as they provided the resources to support the original settlements, supplied the materials to build the city and dictated its urban form. Because of their symbolism and visual prominence preservation policies have been implemented to protect them from urbanization. Starting in 1977 the government instituted an urban growth boundary to prevent urbanization in Los Cerros. However, the large rural to urban migrations that began in the mid-twentieth century created an erratic urban expansion that the boundary was unable to contain. Informal and formal developments have continued to expand into protected land regardless of the different containment policies that have been institutionalized. The aim of this thesis is to reexamine Bogota's urban boundary in order to devise alternative strategies that can better address the inevitable urbanization of Los Cerros. The argument is rooted in the premise that social, political and economical conditions will prevent containment strategies to succeed. As a result, urbanization is acknowledged and used as a proxy to design strategies that will bolster and improve existing social and natural ecologies.

    "abstract": "As natural and human made environments become increasingly monitored and modulated by embedded digital technologies, we are presented with a staggering flow of information reverberating between the scales of the made, the grown, and ourselves. In this thesis, I use two projects as cases for interrogating the material, computational, and biological architecture mediating this information. Common to these projects is the move towards a novel cyber-biological system, which couples physical and digital processes, and utilizes microbiota as natural and programmable agents. I posit that microbes are well suited to mediating between humans and our environments, especially when they are exploited for informing on, or intervening in, phenomena that occur in temporal and spatial scales towards which we are not sensitive. In the thesis, I theoretically frame cyber-biological systems as instantiations of a post-ecological cybernetic vision, collapsing the divide between the made and the natural. As creative interventions, I describe projects designed to provide community and individual access to participate in this hybridized ecology, and suggest future research to explore microbes as sensors, living visualizations, and deployable interventions. The projects I discuss figure the microbiome as an enabling substrate for the extension of our sensitivity to natural ecosystems (Waterfly), the built urban environment (Underworlds), ultimately suggesting a similar extension of sensitivity to our bodies (Everybiome). My analysis of these projects culminates with ideas for future research (Biological Homeostat, Biovisualizations). By exploring realized cyber-biological systems alongside more speculative ones, I establish scientific and technological challenges in their deployment and future development. Through a critical analysis of these projects, I crystallize a design attitude towards creating sensitivity to environments, and juxtapose it with the optimization-oriented problem solving common to the discourse on \"responsive\" and \"smart\" environments. Ultimately, I aim to contribute an interdisciplinary synthesis of a scientific paradigm that is emerging between the domains of biological engineering, computation, and the design of our built environment. In promoting new connections between bits, bricks, and biology, I hope to inform contemporary practices of how we design technologies that extend the reach of our senses to the phenomena in our hybridizing made and natural world.",

    "abstract": "I present a novel drawing system for composing and rendering perspective scenes. The proposed approach uses a projective two-dimensional representation for primitives rather than a conventional three-dimensional description. This representation is based on points that lie on the surface of a unit sphere centered at the viewpoint. It allows drawings to be composed with the same ease as traditional illustrations, while providing many of the advantages of a three-dimensional model. I describe a range of user-interface tools and interaction techniques that give the drawing system its three-dimensional-like capabilities. The system provides vanishing point guides and perspective grids to aid in drawing freehand strokes and composing perspective scenes. The system also has tools for intuitive navigation of a virtual camera, as well as methods for manipulating drawn primitives so that they appear to undergo three-dimensional translations and rotations. The new representation also supports automatic shading of primitives using either realistic or non-photorealistic styles. My system supports drawing and shading of extrusion surfaces with automatic hidden surface removal and emphasized silhouettes. Casting shadows from an infinite light source is also possible with minimal user intervention. I describe a method for aligning a sketch drawn outside the system using its vanishing points, allowing the integration of computer sketching and freehand sketching on paper in an iterative manner. Photographs and scanned drawings are applied to drawing primitives using conventional texture-mapping techniques, thereby enriching drawings and providing another way of incorporating hand-drawn images.

In Egypt, Coste served as the chief architect of the Ottoman Viceroy, Muhammad Ali, during the early portion of his reign. Coste worked on modernizing Lower Egypt through various architectural and engineering projects. I plan to show that Coste was not only responsive to the needs of progressive design but was also sensitive to the Egyptian culture, creating a stylistic synthesis of European and Islamic forms. Unfortunately, due to Muhammad Ali's military expenditures, much of Coste's work was sidelined, to be built later in the governor's reign. Coste's original designs and realized buildings, however, continued to have a great impact on the design of Egyptian architecture throughout the nineteenth century. Through a narrative of the life of Coste concluding with his publication of Architecture Arabe ou Monuments du Kaire in 1837, I will illustrate Coste's attitude toward the Muslim world, his reasons for compiling the study of Egypt's monuments, and the ultimate reception the book received in mid-nineteenth century France. Coste greatly admired the Islamic architecture of Egypt and through his work hoped to share this love with his European audience. In addition, he wished to contribute to the pursuit of Islamic architectural history. Ultimately, Coste's work had little impact on nineteenth century historical studies because of the change in European politics and Europeans' attitudes toward the Middle East during the later part of the nineteenth century. By discussing Coste's life in the context of contemporary historical developments, I will argue that Coste's innovative objectivity led to the neglect of his work during the nineteenth century and the renewed appreciation of it by historians of Islamic architecture in the early twentieth century and beyond.",

    "abstract": "This thesis proposes a process of providing mass-customized housing based on computer-aided design and production systems. It focuses on the design part, which mainly consists of an interactive system for the generation of design solutions based on a mathematical model called discursive grammar. A discursive grammar includes a shape grammar, a description grammar, and a set of heuristics. The shape grammar provides the rules of formal composition, whereas the description grammar describes the design from other relevant viewpoints. The set of heuristics is used to guide the generation of designs by comparing the description of the evolving design with the description of the desired house. The generation of a design proceeds first by producing a design brief from the user-prompted requirements and then by finding a solution that satisfies this brief. Search is largely deterministic, which decreases the amount of time required to find a solution, thereby making it reasonable to develop Web-based implementations. The proposed model enables an enduring designer's dream, that of the mass customization of housing. The model is illustrated with a case study that includes a shape grammar developed for the houses designed by the architect Alvaro Siza at Malagueira, a description grammar based on the Portuguese housing regulations, and a set of heuristics inferred after a set of experiments. In these experiments, designers were asked to generate houses based on the Malagueira grammar for specific clients. It is argued that this discursive grammar provides a rigorous method for understanding and teaching Siza's design process and that similar grammars could be developed for other styles.

Drawing on feminist readings of autobiography and on the relationships elaborated by Henri Lefebvre and Georg Simmel between modernity and the everyday, the daily is described here as an expansive site encompassing subjugating repetition and familiarity as well as discourses of worldliness and possibilities for subversion. The discussion centers on Münter's travels in the United States as an emblem of the stretch of her dailiness and its instructive vantage on issues of authenticity and documentation governing her output. Miinter's pocket calendars, sketchbooks, photographs, photograph album, and retrospective writings about America are considered as a project of forging Heimat and visuality. With its associations of effortlessness, the use of \"cakewalking\" in the title evokes the erasure of Miinter's daily processes in their messiness. The cakewalk was a form for African Americans to parody their masters in the antebellum period and was taken up by whites at the time of Münter' s visit; she herself designed a postcard of a young relative performing the dance. Though the daily enabled Münter to come into representation, by its slightness and imbrication in mass culture, it would go underground in service of authenticity. The argument is grounded in the American context through readings of period guidebook literature, discourses of shopping and fldnerie, and Kodak advertising; theatrical productions and tourist sites Münter visited; and relationships between her work and contemporary Arkansas photographers such as Harry Miller.",

    "title": "The \"Skyscraper problem\" and the city beautiful : the Woolworth Building",
    "abstract": "The \"skyscraper problem\" challenged the thought and practice of civic designers and architects prior to World War I. It referred to the incompatibility of City Beautiful principles with economically propelled land development, and to the contradiction between the notion of architecture as an art and the skyscraper's programmatic and technical requirements. Civic designers in New York had difficulty accommodating the skyscraper in their large-scale plans. They also found that it intruded on their vision for the business street, hindered their attempts to plan City Hall Park as New York's civic center, and created a chaotic skyline. Bruce Price, Louis Sullivan, Thomas Hastings, Cyrus L.W. Eidlitz, and other architects suggested alternative proposals for subjecting the skyscraper to the constraints of design . Prior to the design of the Woolworth Building, however, architectural critics did not unanimously endorse any single approach. Frank Woolworth chose a site for his proposed headquarters at the intersection of City Hall Park, New York's civic center, with lower Broadway, the spine of its business district . Woolworth commissioned Cass Gilbert to design the Woolworth Building in 1910. Gilbert shared the City Beautiful vision of McKim, Mead & White and Daniel Burnham. He also accepted the skyscraper's pragmatic requirements. Woolworth intended his headquarters to function as a speculative office building, but also to look like a civic institution.

    "text": "The \"Skyscraper problem\" and the city beautiful : the Woolworth Building The \"skyscraper problem\" challenged the thought and practice of civic designers and architects prior to World War I. It referred to the incompatibility of City Beautiful principles with economically propelled land development, and to the contradiction between the notion of architecture as an art and the skyscraper's programmatic and technical requirements. Civic designers in New York had difficulty accommodating the skyscraper in their large-scale plans. They also found that it intruded on their vision for the business street, hindered their attempts to plan City Hall Park as New York's civic center, and created a chaotic skyline. Bruce Price, Louis Sullivan, Thomas Hastings, Cyrus L.W. Eidlitz, and other architects suggested alternative proposals for subjecting the skyscraper to the constraints of design . Prior to the design of the Woolworth Building, however, architectural critics did not unanimously endorse any single approach. Frank Woolworth chose a site for his proposed headquarters at the intersection of City Hall Park, New York's civic center, with lower Broadway, the spine of its business district . Woolworth commissioned Cass Gilbert to design the Woolworth Building in 1910. Gilbert shared the City Beautiful vision of McKim, Mead & White and Daniel Burnham. He also accepted the skyscraper's pragmatic requirements. Woolworth intended his headquarters to function as a speculative office building, but also to look like a civic institution. The imagery of a civic institution would represent the capitol of his commercial \"empire\" as well as display his civic-mindedness, wealth, and cosmopolitanism. The Woolworth Building's siting at New York's civic center, its composition, its arcade, and its sculptural and mural decoration identified it with the prevailing concept of the civic building.

    "abstract": "This dissertation revises the history of internationalism through a study of the American architects Marion Mahony and Walter Burley Griffin, who practiced in the United States, Australia, and India between 1895 and 1949. Unlike previous studies of internationalism, which have focused exclusively on the transfer of architectural and planning knowledge from the putative 'West' to the 'non-West', this dissertation uncovers a global formulation of community proposed within the colonipl periphery. It does so through a sustained analysis of two objects by Mahony and Griffin: Magic of America, an unpublished memoir and political treatise consisting of correspondence and essays, which Mahony compiled and edited between 1938 and 1949, and Castlecrag, a residential suburb along Sydney's Middle Harbour, which Mahony and Griffin developed between 1920 and 1935. Delineating the scope and provenance of their theoretical writings on imperialism, democracy, international conflict, and trade, as well as their design of common property at Castlecrag, this study charts the emergence of a non-nationalist alternative to empire. Concomitantly, it argues that the conceptual sources and motivations for this alternative, global community were far removed from instrumental politics, and flowed instead from a moral-philosophical thesis that evaluative meaning existed in our relations with others. Finally, this dissertation examines how Mahony's and Griffin's written and built work was shaped by the dialectic offin-de-siecle utopianism and International Socialism.",

This approach gives only general information about thermal comfort and indoor air quality, which is limiting for the design of energy efficient and healthy buildings. The design of these buildings requires sophisticated but practical tools that are not currently available, and the objective of this thesis is to develop such a tool. The development of the simple design tool had several phases. Each phase employed simplified models validated with measured data in order to assess model accuracy and reliability.

Based on the collected data, we first developed simplified boundary conditions for the diffuser jet flow, which is the key flow element in mechanically ventilated spaces. The boundary conditions employ resultant momentum from the supply diffusers without modeling the detailed diffuser geometry. Although simple, the models can simulate airflow from complex diffusers commonly used for air-conditioning with reasonable accuracy. Another simplification is the use of a zero-equation turbulence model to calculate indoor air distribution. The model uses the concept of eddy-viscosity and approximate turbulent viscosity with an algebraic equation. To test the turbulence model, an airflow program was developed. The program can simulate indoor airflow on a PC within several minutes, which is five to ten times faster than with the similar programs with a \"standard\" k-£ model.

    "abstract": "This dissertation investigates changes that occurred in architectural culture in respect to conditions of modernity. Large-scale industrialization and urbanization caused dramatic ruptures with traditional social and economic hierarchies, forcing a reconceptualization of the theoretical constructs underlying architecture. During the course of the nineteenth century, writers on architecture took an active role in attempting to make sense of these changes. By the end of the century, the Viennese architect and theorist Adolf Loos set forth a critical project, often in confrontation with the views of others, to overcome the growing separation between the realms of reality and representation in design. The particular objective of this study is to situate Loos's texts within the intellectual context of Austrian and German writings on architecture and the practical arts. Such theories prefigure important expressions of modernism in the twentieth century. These writings also express a deep range of thoughts on the changing material and intellectual conditions affecting the visual arts. They exemplify a long series of attempts to create a unified identity for architecture in a world of new social relations and value systems. Despite amorphous conditions which favored social heterogeneity and difference, writers sought uniformity and an authoritative ground for architectural logic. The textual discourse in journals and books reveals the mental structures and preoccupations of writers in the grips of rapid transformation. On the practical level, new functional needs led to an expanded and diverse range of building types and plans. Further, industrial advances in construction technology and the use of new materials such as iron and glass challenged the applicability of traditional architectural forms for these new buildings. In turn, in a theoretical vein, debates on ethnic and historical genealogy and the epistemological or ontological foundations of all aspects of design turned architectural thought away from its former reliance on classicist paradigms of knowledge. It was also during the nineteenth century that historical consciousness structured architectural epistemology. As traditional guarantors of knowledge were questioned, the entirety of concepts defining architecture was transfigured. Laos and other writers sought to re-define the now hotly contested concepts of craft, art, architect, beauty, function, and truth. Conceptual production was frequently crafted through binary oppositions such as national/international or real/ideal. Loos's response to these developments was divided. On the one hand, he recognized cultural fragmentation and argued for the separate development of art and architecture. On the other hand, his vision of a design world dominated by the hand crafts and aristocratic values constitutes the Enlightenment vision of stability amidst progress.",

Moro's sponsorship of San Giobbe, a charitable institution in one of the poorer neighborhoods of fifteenth-century Venice, serves as the point of departure for this study. Drawing on a wide range of sources including testamentary bequests, building and confraternity histories, and landholding policies, I examine how Moro transformed a site that was associated with social and spiritual abjection into a showcase of ducal power. In formulating a set of questions for Moro's work at San Giobbe, I try to move beyond questions of attribution and chronology that have typically dominated studies of Doge Moro's work. I examine in particular Moro's tomb, a burial slab placed in the ground in the high altar chapel of San Giobbe; his funerary slab represents a temporary break from ducal burial tradition in Venice. I root my study of the tomb in the evolving nature of Renaissance commemoration practice by devising an approach for the study of a commemorative object that can not be read as an iconographic text like many other contemporaneous ducal tombs.

These new populations affected the composition and intellectual discourse of the city.

He incorporated his experience working with Josep Lluís Sert, Le Corbusier, and Roberto Matta to propose a series of housing projects that sought to mine the tactics of Surrealism.

At the same time, he courted opposing political orientations, from the totalitarianism of a military dictatorship (1943-1946) to the populist politics of president Juan Perón (1946- 1955), to his strategic erasure by the military government of General Aramburu (1955-1958).

Public housing, an architectural program where political discourse, culture, and city growth collide, brings these multiple networks together.

    "abstract": "This dissertation investigates the sudden proliferation of mausolea in Iran and Central Asia in the tenth and eleventh centuries and how their patrons, who were secular rulers of Iranian descent, drew on the pre-Islamic past in new ways specific to each region. Mausolea constructed in the tenth and eleventh centuries have a wide geographical spread across modem Iran and the ex-Soviet Central Asian republics. However, the monuments take two different forms: the tomb tower and the domed square. There are formal and functional differences and a different geographical distribution, with the earliest tomb towers concentrated in the inaccessible Alborz Mountains in northern Iran. This remote region had a very different historical trajectory from that of Central Asia, where the earliest extant domed square mausolea are located. Historians of architecture have often noted that certain features seen in these mausolea have some vague connection with the pre-Islamic past, but this connection has never been precisely defined or explained; I argue that the cultural dynamics which resulted in particular architectural forms were very different in these two regions, so that pre-Islamic Iranian traditions were selectively continued in the Caspian region of northern Iran, whereas other elements of the Iranian past were consciously revived in Central Asia. Two of the mausolea that I analyze, the Samanid mausoleum and the Gunbad-i Qabus, are well-known monuments which appear in virtually every survey of Islamic art, whereas most of the others are almost completely unknown.",

Mausolea constructed in the tenth and eleventh centuries have a wide geographical spread across modem Iran and the ex-Soviet Central Asian republics. However, the monuments take two different forms: the tomb tower and the domed square. There are formal and functional differences and a different geographical distribution, with the earliest tomb towers concentrated in the inaccessible Alborz Mountains in northern Iran. This remote region had a very different historical trajectory from that of Central Asia, where the earliest extant domed square mausolea are located. Historians of architecture have often noted that certain features seen in these mausolea have some vague connection with the pre-Islamic past, but this connection has never been precisely defined or explained; I argue that the cultural dynamics which resulted in particular architectural forms were very different in these two regions, so that pre-Islamic Iranian traditions were selectively continued in the Caspian region of northern Iran, whereas other elements of the Iranian past were consciously revived in Central Asia. Two of the mausolea that I analyze, the Samanid mausoleum and the Gunbad-i Qabus, are well-known monuments which appear in virtually every survey of Islamic art, whereas most of the others are almost completely unknown."

    "abstract": "Jack Tworkov began painting in the 1920s and made his reputation later as an Abstract Expressionist working in a gestural style. At the age of sixty-five Tworkov put that reputation on the line by undergoing a radical transformation in style and, within a few years, emerged as one of the innovative geometric painters of the later 1960s and the 1970s. This dissertation focuses on works from 1955, when Tworkov began to paint wholly idiosyncratic canvases, to 1979, at which time he significantly changed his brushstroke, a stylistic element that functions as a thread throughout this period. Other binding concepts include a continuing attempt to reconcile painterliness and spontaneity with premeditated structure and the combination of choice and chance in generating new ideas and compositions . This dissertation attempts to provide a complete analysis of this specific portion of Tworkov's work, which has never been done, and to avail the reader of a significant collection of artist's statements drawn from a variety of sources including Tworkov's own diary notes, the art historical literature , and personal interviews with the author. The analysis of the works is contextual, within the frame work of Tworkov's career itself, and proceeds stylistically rather than chronologically, identifying, explaining, and pursuing trends in Tworkov's works over an extended period of time. Iconographic analyses are provided where most appropriate and where most illustrative Tworkov's relationship to other artists has been discussed. The work from 1955 to 1979 has been divided into three major segments: Transitional Works, including the Painterly Abstractions and the Fields; the Structural/Geometric Works, subdivided into early geometric canvases, further experiments with geometry, and the Bisections; and the System Works, including both the Knight Moves and the Three-Five-Eight series.",

    "title": "From the portfolio to the diagram : architectural discourse and the transformation of the discipline of architecture in America, 1918-1943",
    "abstract": "This dissertation is an historical inquiry into the concomitant transformations of architectural discourse and the discipline of architecture in America. It proceeds on the theoretical assumption that the documents produced and used in architecture not only reflect but constitute architecture as an institutional practice. The study begins with an outline of the academic discipline established, during the late nineteenth century, along the ideals of artistic autonomy and methods of the Ecole des Beaux Arts. It was an internalized discipline, centered on the self-referential discursive practice of the portfolio, and the integrated conceptual framework of composition, planning and the parti. During the latter half of the 1910s, with the changing conditions of architectural production, the traditional status of architecture began to be cast into doubt. In the aftermath of this crisis, what had once been an efficacious disciplinary formation was fragmented into the formal concerns of composition and the concept of functional planning as a rational intervention into social institutions. By the late twenties, ideological formations that made a fundamental break with the traditional claim to autonomy had emerged. The study examines two divergent strains of rationalist ideology: first, the new editorial policies of the architectural journals which projected in different ways, a rational discipline that would be integrated with the demands of mass production and consumer society; secondly, the Veblenian strategy of Frederick Ackerman, who attempted to isolate a domain of architectural discourse uncontaminated by the exigencies of capitalism. Two important transformations of architectural discourse that ensued during the thirties will be examined: the first was the shift in the status of the discourse of reference, constituted by the emergence of new types of reference manuals; secondly, the transformation of the architectural journal which saw the demise of the traditional status of the portfolio and its reorganization along studies of planning. At the center of these transformations was what I have called the discourse of the diagram. Through this new discursive formation, planning emerged as an integral discipline of architecture; it allowed the architect to intervene into the institutional program, while maintaining an independent method that was rational, free of formal preconceptions, and yet would produce singular results for each project. What had been a closed and tightly organized discipline was now opened and dispersed. Along with its promise of social amelioration, it carried the constant burden of formal invention.",

    "abstract": "This dissertation undertakes a comparative and developmental analysis of Frank Lloyd Wright's community scale planning projects executed in the wake of Broadacre City during the decade of the Second World War (1938 - 1948). These include the Sun-Top Homes built in Ardmore Pennsylvania, the Usonia I project for East Lansing Michigan, the Pittsfield Worker Housing project designed for western Massachusetts, the master plan for Circle Pines summer camp in central Wisconsin, and three partially built circular lot subdivisions, Galesburg Country Homes near Galesburg Michigan, Parkwyn Village in Kalamazoo Michigan, and Usonia Homes in Pleasantville New York. Through this study of seven planning projects Wright's thinking can be seen moving from a tradition of viewing the settlement as a 'constructed whole' to a design philosophy that approached nature as an a-priori, all embracing context. In these works he explored the relationship of the natural to the manmade by inventing patterns which allow neither the site nor the geometry of the plan to assume cognitive priority. One's perception of the relationship between the individual and the group comes to be crossed with one's perception of the character of the landscape in ways that extend an American hermeneutical tradition of self and landscape into the modem era. Building on the method of Emerson, and especially on the explorations of Thoreau and Whitman, Wright sought to redefine the ever-present tension between the individual and the democratic group in terms of a symbolic interaction of self and landscape that lies at the heart of the American myth of nature. His involvement with self, with nature, and with perceptions of community as indicated here suggests an alternative to traditional American suburban models, as well as to the European inspired hOUSing ideas coming into this country in the post-war period.",

The urban grid, public spaces, state institutions and housing typologies introduced during his reign permanently altered the character of Tehran. Through the use of 19th and 20th century maps and records, newly discovered building plans, and original architectural surveys, this dissertation investigates the nature of the urban change. An analysis of the structural elements of the traditional city-- wall and gates, royal citadel, religious buildings, and residential neighborhoods-- serves as a reference point for evaluating the modernization of the Reza Shah period. Reza Shah initiated a rapid and irrevocable process of change that began in the public domain at the city scale and filtered into the private domain of the house. A grid of wide boulevards, traffic circles, and planned public spaces were superimposed on the traditional city. Foreign and native architects designed new state institutions including ministries, banks, museums, universities and schools. They introduced modern materials and a variety of forms incorporating both historical and modern influences. On public buildings and monuments, pre-Islamic imagery particularly from the Achaemenid period symbolized the new central state's reawakening of past grandeur. This study examines not only key elements of urban and architectural change in Tehran but also the process and effects of change itself. The public building program enabled a first generation of Iranian architects to define a modern profession and, ultimately, to expand beyond the symbolic , monumental requirements of state architecture. In Tehran's private architecture both Iranian and foreign architects found their most creative expression.

    "abstract": "Biological design is as ancient as human civilization. For thousands of years, living systems and natural processes have been manipulated by humans and their biological outcomes have been customized for different purposes. While the idea of biological design has always been prevalent throughout history, especially with the discovery of DNA, the ability to manipulate the form, function, and behavior of the living has significantly advanced. Today synthetic biology is pushing the frontiers of biological design even further. Now, living things can be completely abstracted from their original biological contexts, assembled like molecular constructs, and engineered like circuits or programmed like computational hardware. biological designers compose biological form and function by running modeling and simulation software; order standardized biological parts from online libraries and databases; utilize fabrication companies to synthesize gene products to prototype their designs; and build complex artifacts, applications and services that meet human wants, needs, fears, and desires on a daily basis. In this dissertation, I examine different practices of biological design in life sciences and engineering based on different theoretical models. I trace the history of information-based, relational, synthesis-oriented methods and present a new design framework that offers a spatial and a context-driven approach to the design of living matter. Being rooted in a different interpretation of space and spatiality in design, the framework approaches biological design systematically, at three stages: 1) the design of the basic units of the living (Units), 2) how different units are arranged and composed for different functionalities and behavior (Logic), and 3) the design of the biological contexts where biological artifacts live and perform their objectives (Context). This new framework intends to bring together a multitude of approaches from different design fields such as engineering, architecture and product Design that have their unique histories with living matter.

    "title": "Flexibility in building design : a real options approach and valuation methodology to address risk",
    "abstract": "This research develops an approach to designing and valuing flexible systems subject to identified future uncertainties. The approach addresses two shortcomings of current design and decision-making practices that are particularly evident in the buildings industry: 1) systems are designed as though they will remain as static entities despite existing in uncertain environments, and 2) typical decision-making methods, such as net present value and life-cycle costing, do not recognize uncertainty and the ability to make decisions in the future as uncertainties are resolved. The flexible design approach produces an improved design result by addressing the risks and opportunities induced by uncertainty. Two applications relevant to sustainable building design are developed to demonstrate the approach. First, the value of the flexibility to change the use of a space, thereby increasing building longevity and reducing waste, is evaluated. Option value is defined as the savings of low renovations costs as compared to the cost of renting space on the market. Uncertainties include the market price of rent, timing, amount of space needed, and number of renovations. It is shown that higher upfront investment leading to reduced cost for future change is economically justified in certain scenarios. The value of flexibility increases with increased time horizon and increased uncertainty in the market price of rent. The Black-Scholes formula can be used to approximate the value of flexibility in some cases. Second, the risk of employing an innovative technology is addressed with a flexible design that provides a fallback position.",

The approach addresses two shortcomings of current design and decision-making practices that are particularly evident in the buildings industry: 1) systems are designed as though they will remain as static entities despite existing in uncertain environments, and 2) typical decision-making methods, such as net present value and life-cycle costing, do not recognize uncertainty and the ability to make decisions in the future as uncertainties are resolved. The flexible design approach produces an improved design result by addressing the risks and opportunities induced by uncertainty. Two applications relevant to sustainable building design are developed to demonstrate the approach. First, the value of the flexibility to change the use of a space, thereby increasing building longevity and reducing waste, is evaluated. Option value is defined as the savings of low renovations costs as compared to the cost of renting space on the market. Uncertainties include the market price of rent, timing, amount of space needed, and number of renovations. It is shown that higher upfront investment leading to reduced cost for future change is economically justified in certain scenarios. The value of flexibility increases with increased time horizon and increased uncertainty in the market price of rent. The Black-Scholes formula can be used to approximate the value of flexibility in some cases. Second, the risk of employing an innovative technology is addressed with a flexible design that provides a fallback position."

    "abstract": "Today digital models for design exploration are not used to their full potential. The research efforts in the past decades have placed geometric design representations firmly at the center of digital design environments. In this thesis it is argued that models for design exploration that bridge different representation aid in the discovery of novel designs. Replacing commonly used analytical, uni-directional models for linking representations, with bidirectional ones, further supports design exploration. The key benefit of bidirectional models is the ability to swap the role of driver and driven in the exploration. The thesis developed around a set of design experiments that tested the integration of bidirectional computational models in domain specific designs. From the experiments three main exploration types emerged. They are: branching explorations for establishing constraints for an undefined design problem; illustrated in the design of a concept car. Circular explorations for the refinement of constraint relationships; illustrated in the design of a chair. Parallel explorations for exercising well-understood constraints; illustrated in a form finding model in architecture. A key contribution of the thesis is the novel use of constraint diagrams developed to construct design explorers for the experiments. The diagrams show the importance of translations between design representations in establishing design drivers from the set of constraints. The incomplete mapping of design features across different representations requires the redescription of the design for each translation.",

    "abstract": "The design studio, as both a learning environment and a social place, is one of the major components of architectural education. Traditionally, the studio has been considered a place for individual design work and one-on-one mentoring between an instructor and a student. With the integration of new information and telecommunication technologies, the nature of the design studio and the learning processes within it are being altered. This new landscape of the design studio offers opportunities for globally distributed collaborative work as well as new interpretations of design processes and studio practices. The technologies and the studio system are interwoven and their symbiotic relationships need to be understood if these technology-mediated long-distance collaborative design studios are to be common, valuable, and creative occurrences in architectural education. In this study, the consequences of integrating telecommunication technologies into the design studio are examined through ten cases. The new studios involve multidisciplinary design participants from separate and distant physical and social environments that are electronically connected for sharing design ideas, creating a common understanding of design practices, and co-constructing design objects. With technology use, changes occur in the studio's participants and relationships, the design content and processes, and the events and organization. I argue that the changes to the studio can create an enriched environment for design learning. The successive case studies represent a dynamic pedagogic strategy in which both students and teachers are active participants in constructing their new technology-mediated learning environment through creative experimentation. The findings of these cases provide a comprehensive description of the technical and social characteristics, conditions, and practices of remote collaborative design studios. In these new virtual design studios, there are rich opportunities for building innovative and effective communities for design education in which the traditional boundaries of time, culture, language, discipline, and institution are blurred and new configurations for design learning become possible.",

This dissertation develops and improves several strategies to better understand the behavior of masonry structures under seismic loading, and to determine their safety. The primary focus is on historic arched or vaulted structures, but more modern unreinforced masonry structures are also considered. Assessment strategies which employ simplified quasi-static loading to simulate seismic effects are initially addressed. New analysis methods which focus on stability or strength are presented, and the merits of these strategies are clarified. First, a new parametric graphical equilibrium method is developed which allows real-time analysis and illuminates the complex stability of vaulted masonry structures. Second, a finite element strategy for predicting brittle fracture of masonry structures is extended to incorporate non-proportional loading and shell elements. These extensions enable prediction of damage and collapse mechanisms in general, but are specifically used to predict the response of a full-scale masonry structure to quasi-static cyclic loading. Subsequently, assessment methods based on the dynamic response of masonry structures under earthquake loading are presented. First, rigid body dynamics and an experimental testing program are used to characterize the rocking response of the masonry arch for the first time.",

The principal thesis is that contacts with phenomenology were at the crux of the 1970s shift from modernist to postmodernist thinking in architecture.

    "abstract": "This dissertation examines the modernization of the United States through a group of regulatory techniques and institutions that emerged in the early twentieth century. In this period, conceptions of power based on laissez-faire capitalism were giving way to systems of governance that aimed to control the economies of the home, market, nature and labor. Methods of avoiding, delaying, and constraining the uncertainties resulting from the massive economic development of the nation established a new approach to securing its future through the regulation of risk. While predictability and efficiency are often invoked as core principles of modernism, these were in fact ideologies that gained their force through these earlier attempts to manage and forestall risk. The dissertation identifies four cases in which technology and architecture served as critical instruments for the implementation of regulation in the modern interior. The application of thermostatic control of heat for domestic architecture established a norm for room temperature that, through the home economics movement, became a hygienic standard for the modern American home. In cold storage facilities, mechanical refrigeration technologies were employed to regulate the longevity of perishable food. By extending the life of produce, these warehouses served as control centers for distributing the nation's food supply and regulating the futures market that determined their prices.",

With feedback from a wide range of stakeholders - architects, structural engineers, policy makers, rating-scheme developers, this research presents an integrated assessment approach to compare embodied life cycle impacts of building structures. Existing literature indicates that there is an urgent need for benchmarking the embodied carbon of building structures. To remediate this, a rigorous and transparent methodology is presented on multiple scales. On the material scale, a comparative analysis defines reliable Embodied Carbon Coefficients (ECC, expressed in kgCO2e/kg) for the structural materials concrete, steel, and timber. On the structural scale, data analysis evaluates the Structural Material Quantities (SMQ, expressed in kg/m²) and the embodied carbon for existing building structures (expressed in kgCO2e/m²). An interactive database of building projects is created in close collaboration with leading structural design firms worldwide. Results show that typical buildings range between 200 and 550 kgCO2e/m² on average, but these results can vary widely dependent on structural systems, height, size, etc. On the urban scale, an urban modeling method to simulate the embodied carbon of neighborhoods is proposed and applied to a Middle Eastern case study. A series of extreme low carbon case studies are analyzed. Results demonstrate that a novel design approach can lead to buildings with an embodied carbon as low as 30 kgCO2e/m² which is an order of magnitude lower than conventional building structures today. Two pathways are implemented to lower the embodied carbon of structures: choosing low carbon materials (low ECC) and optimizing the structural efficiency of buildings (low SMQ).

    "abstract": "This dissertation is an historical inquiry into the role played by new building materials in the formation of architectural modernism in France. It proceeds on the theoretical assumption that a \"material\" is not a technical given -- a securely defined entity in the physical and linguistic senses -- but an architectural construct whose \"inherent properties\" are a matter of interpretation. It suggests that within a specific architectural culture, the conceptions and uses of a material are defined by concerns that are not only constructional but involve architectural doctrines, building practices, aesthetic projects, and cultural strategies. Since the publication of Sigfried Giedion's Bauen in Frankreich. Bauen in Eisen. Bauen in Eisenbeton (1928), reinforced concrete has been commonly accepted as the common denominator of French modernism. The dissertation questions this interpretive assumption, focusing on the changing conceptions of the material as an index of transformations in French architecture and architectural culture. It covers a period that spans from the Universal Exhibition of 1889 to the early 1930s, a period which saw the development of reinforced concrete in French architecture, from its emergence within architectural discourses to its inscription within early modernist historiography. Through a close examination of contemporary books and periodicals, unpublished sources, and graphic documents, the dissertation explores the theories and works that framed the critical relationship of new material to French modernism. Inaugurated with the late nineteenth-century demise of metal as the leading material in architectural theory, the preeminence of reinforced concrete in French architecture was marked by the dispersion of rationalist tenets into competing architectural programs. The First World War was a pivotal event in this process. Of principal importance were the positions of Auguste Perret and Le Corbusier. While Perret insisted on continuity with prewar practices, emphasizing the role of craft production, Le Corbusier embraced the rupture brought about by the societe machinique, shifting towards the idea of industrialized construction. These positions were key to the technical and aesthetic definition of the modem house, from the function of the concrete frame to the nature of external revetments. They also led the way to the cultural and ideological debates that ensued on the nationality of the material and the sources of modem architecture. In the late 1920s the return of metal merely underscored the \"rhetoric of materials\" in the definition of French modernism.",

I present a shape grammar for teaching the architectural style - the language of designs - described in this manual. This grammar is distinguished by two objectives, and the technical means used to accomplish them. First, the grammar is for teaching. Usually, the author of a grammar of a style aims to generate all and only the designs in the language. To do this, he not only writes the grammar, but also judges whether the designs it generates are members of the language. In the Yingzaofashi grammar, on the other hand, I want to generate all and more than the designs in the language. It is then the student who evaluates the designs - does this design belong to the language? - and adjusts the grammar accordingly. Thus the student participates actively in defining the language of designs, and learns that style is a human construct. Second, the grammar is designerly. As already observed, most authors of style grammars focus on the language of designs; they do not consider how to structure the user's interaction with the grammar. By contrast, I consider explicitly what the user decides and when he decides it, and organize the grammar accordingly. In other words, I consider process as well as products. The grammar exploits several technical devices for the first time: the design as an n-tuple of drawings, descriptions, and other elements; the generation of descriptions in the n-tuple; and techniques that are made possible by these devices.",

    "abstract": "Mexico City is a special case in urban history because the measures taken by the Aztec and Spanish to avoid inundations have fundamentally changed the city's character. In 1521, it was an island-city; in 1629, it lay near the banks of Lake Mexico; and by 1700, it rested on a reclaimed mainland. This transformation is significant, speaking not only to the flood control approaches of the Aztec and Spanish, but equally important, to how these methods profoundly altered this city's urban condition. Like the Aztec, the Spanish sought to control the six lakes surrounding the city to prevent inundations, yet their approach was quite different. The Aztec relied on containment and regulation, while the Spanish undertook drainage, referred to as the desagüe. Despite the scholarly attention devoted to pre-Columbian and colonial hydraulics, no research examines the relationship between the city's lacustrine environment and its urban transformation. \"The Hydrographic City\" addresses three key questions: (1) What were the respective flood control approaches of the Aztec and Spanish? (2) How did these approaches shape two different cities? (3) How did the Aztec and the Spanish differ in how they conceived the city's aquatic condition, and what were the epistemological roots of their strategies for coming to terms with it?",

    "title": "Numerical solution of nonlinear algebraic systems in building energy modeling",
    "abstract": "When solving a system of nonlinear equations by Newton-Raphson's method, a common means of avoiding divergence requires each step to reduce some vector norm of the residual errors, usually the convenient and tractable sum of squares. Unfortunately, the descent requirement subjects the solver to difficulties typically associated with function minimization-- stagnation, and convergence to local minima. The descent requirement also can disrupt a successful Newton-Raphson sequence. To explore these problems, the thesis reformulates the theory of function minimization in terms of the familiar Jacobian matrix, which linearizes the equations, and a vector which relates first-order changes in the norm to first-order changes in the residuals. The resulting expressions give the norm's gradient, and approximate its Hessian, as functions of the key variables defining the underlying equations. Therefore when Newton- raphson diverges, the solver can choose a reasonable alternate search strategy directly from the Jacobian model, and subsequently construct an appropriate norm for evaluating the search. Applying these results, the thesis modifies a standard equation-solving algorithm, the double dogleg method. Replacing the published algorithm's r-square norm with a general family of weighted r-square norms, it develops and tests a variety of rules for choosing the particular weighting factors. Selecting new weights at each iteration avoids local minima; in tests on a standard suite of nonlinear systems, the resulting algorithms prove more robust to stagnation, and often converge faster, than the double dogleg. In separate investigations, the thesis specializes to equation-solving a double dogleg variation which minimizes the norm model in the plane of its steepest descent and Newton-Raphson directions, and develops a scalar measure of divergence which, unlike a residual norm, does not depend on results from function minimization.",

    "title": "The shape of the support : painting and politics in Syria's twentieth century",
    "abstract": "This dissertation offers an intellectual history of painting in Syria in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s that accounts for new regimes of political representation, from French Mandate rule to the mass mobilizations of youth-oriented ideological parties to Cold War cultural diplomacy. After an extended introduction that lays out the conditions for the emergence of modem art in Syria, each subsequent chapter situates an artist or artists in a specific institutional setting that provided new terms for critically evaluating the stakes of painting against new ideas about art and its social activation. Chapter Two reads the work of Adham Ismail (1920-1963) against the Bacth political movement of the 1940s, as he mobilized an aesthetic theory of the arabesque to produce radical paintings meant to inculcate Arab modes of cognition supporting a Arab polity. Chapter Three chronicles the Syrian artists who traveled abroad to the Italian art academy system in the early 1950s, detailing the patronage networks that produced \"modern Arab art\" as an identity category while promoting a conception of Mediterranean aesthetics as a shared milieu of free exchange. Chapter Four analyzes Fateh al-Moudarres's (1922-1999) transgressive critique of heritage ideals in Syria, an interrogation of regional identity that brought surrealist automatic painting methods into coordination with the modernist cultural project of Shi'r (Poetry) magazine in Beirut. The final chapter explores the debate about painterly abstraction that was centered around the College of Fine Arts at the University of Damascus in the 1960s and conducted against the waxing and waning of enthusiasm for different tenets of artistic responsibility. Taken together, these case studies of Syrian painting practices and their politics not only shed light on a little-understood formation within the expanded field of modernist practices, but also support a historiographical investigation into the writing of history from the periphery of centralizing market activity. Here, the political party, foreign fellowship, literary magazine, and national university are recognized as generative institutional supports, such that the European bourgeois norms of gallery, museum, and free press are not presumed as a necessary condition for modem painting.",

    "abstract": "A shape grammar develops a drawing through a series of transformations by repeatedly applying if-then rules. Although the rules can be designed, in principle, to construct any type of drawing, the drawings they construct may not necessarily develop in the manner intended by the designer of the grammar. In this thesis, I introduce a shape grammar meta-language that adds power to grammars based on the shape grammar language. Using the shape grammar meta-language, the author of a grammar can: (1) explicitly determine the sequence in which a set of rules is applied; (2) restrict rule application through a filtering process; and (3) use context to guide the rule matching process, all of which provide a guided design experience for the user of the grammar. Three example grammars demonstrate the effectiveness of the meta-language. The first example is the Bilateral Grid grammar which demonstrates how the meta-language facilitates the development of grammars that offer users multiple design choices. The second grammar is the Hexagon Path grammar which demonstrates how the metalanguage is useful in contexts other than architectural design. The third and most ambitious example is the Durand grammar which embodies the floor plan design process described in Précis of the Lectures of Architecture, written by JNL Durand, an eighteenth century architectural educator. Durand's floor plan design process develops a plan through a series of transformations from grid to axis to parti to wall. The corresponding Durand grammar, which consists of 74 rules and 15 macros organized into eight stages, captures Durand's ideas and fills in gaps in Durand's description of his process. A key contribution of this thesis is the seven descriptors that constitute the meta-language. The descriptors are used in grammar rules: (1) to organize a set of rules for the user to choose from; (2) to group together a series of rules; (3) to filter information in a drawing; (4) to constrain where a rule can apply; and (5) to control how a rule is applied.

    "abstract": "William Robert Ware (1832- 1915) planned and directed the first collegiate program in architectural education i n the United States. He was educated in the liberal arts and civil engineering at Harvard University and received further training in architects' offices before entering into practice with Henry Van Brunt (1832-1903). In 1865 Ware was appointed to the newly established Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He remained on the faculty until 1881, when he was called to Columbia University to organize still another collegiate program in architecture. During 1866-67, Ware traveled in Europe, paying particular attention to the role of national schools and professional organizations in the teaching of architecture in Britain and France. Formal instruction in architecture at M.I.T. began in the fall of 1868. Ware devised a curriculum, which he adjusted throughout the 1870s, including drawing and design, architectural history, and construction and practice (i . e., building materials and components, specifications, and contracts). In the spring of 1872, he recruited Eugene Letang (1842-1892), an alumnus of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, to teach design. From this time on, the routine studio problems at M.I.T. began to emulate those of the Ecole, and the eclectic neoclassicism of the Beaux-Arts began to predominate in students' drawings. The Department of Architecture at M.I.T. in these earliest years functioned best in providing a one- or two-year course of special study for persons who were graduates of four-year colleges or who had some experience in architects' offices. It also served to prepare Americans for the formal or informal study they intended to pursue in Paris. Ware's department offered, in effect, a postgraduate program, a program in continuing education, and a preparatory program for advanced study at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. By virtue of its location in cosmopolitan Boston, the M.I.T. Department of Architecture emerged in the 1870s as the preeminent American collegiate program, attracting more students from more diverse parts of the country than the other important early programs at Cornell University and the University of Illinois.

It traces its development from its inception in 1176 under Salah aI-Din al-Ayyubi until it reached its definitive and most monumental form under aI-Nasir Muhammad (1293-1341, with two interruptions). The dissertation focuses on the part of the Citadel called today the southern enclosure, which was the residence of the sultan, and of which only the congregational mosque remains standing. It analyzes the different stages of its topographic and architectural development using primarily references collated from the chronicles, biographical compendia, and legal documents of the Mamluk period, and secondarily surface archeology, toponymy, and typological comparisons with extant Bahri Mamluk palaces in Cairo. Through the reconstruction of the Citadel, the study addresses a number of wider methodological and historical issues. It evaluates the influence of the Mamluk socio-political hierarchy on the structure of the palatial complex and on the conceptualization of its spaces and forms. It stresses the importance of construing the architectural vocabulary of the period in its proper historical context.

It stresses the importance of construing the architectural vocabulary of the period in its proper historical context. And finally, the dissertation questions the modern perception of the architectural development in a medieval Islamic environment by emphasizing the difference between its secular and religious architecture, and by showing how this perception is disproportionately molded by the latter."

    "abstract": "This dissertation examines how the architectural culture of postwar Romania participated in the socialist regime's attempt to construct a new and collectivist environment. The dissertation works from a close reading of examples drawn from three different domains of architectural practice: the architectural and urban design of the Floreasca housing district in Bucharest; the writings of the architectural historian Grigore Ionescu; and the photography of architecture in the magazine Arhitectura. A consistent set of aesthetic and discursive practices emerged from the interrelation between words, images, and actual buildings in each of these examples: the city as new unit of production, standardization, an attack on subjectivity and individualism, technological essentialism, and abstraction were all attributes of the architecture enlisted by the socialist regime in order to establish and consolidate its ideological identity. The dissertation challenges the received descriptions of the postwar artistic context of the Soviet Bloc as one dominated by anti-modernist tendencies, as well as the complementary assumption that, in Romania, the thriving modernism of the interwar years was brought to an end by the postwar socialist regime.",

However the more complex the shapes are, the more difficult it becomes to establish a discourse that embodies the geometrical and spatial properties, as well as the formal attributes of a given shape.

    "abstract": "Due to the overwhelming number of decisions to be made during early stage design, there is a need for intuitive methods to communicate data so that it is quickly and easily understood by the designer. In daylighting analysis, research has been moving towards dynamic daylighting metrics, which include both annual performance indicators and local climate conditions. Temporally-based graphics are one method of annual data display which shows great promise for use in the early design stage. Not only can temporal data be easily connected to time-dependent environmental variables like weather and solar angle, but non-spatial quantities related to solar heat gain can be compared on the same terms with spatial quantities like illuminance. This thesis demonstrates methods for quickly calculating annual data sets for which temporal maps are the intended display format. Metrics are then developed in order to display goal-based performance information for an entire area of interest on a single temporal map. This process is demonstrated first by reducing the number of simulations necessary to produce reliable annual illuminance data, the results of which are compiled into a metric based on a user-given illuminance range, known as Acceptable Illuminance Extent (AIE). Similarly, a geometry-based glare approximation method is developed and validated for quick annual calculations of Daylight Glare Probability, and the results are condensed to a single number representative of glare perception within the model, known as Glare Avoidance Extent (GAE).",

    "abstract": "In the discussion of what makes a \"creative\" or \"imaginative\" design, rational concerns have come to override what we might call the \"aesthetic experience\" - that is, an experience in which all the senses are highly engaged, not only the mind. It has become unpopular and perhaps even politically incorrect to talk about what we feel, like, or respond to viscerally - discussions of emotion, pleasure, or delight are often seen as too subjective, qualitative or illogical, influenced by personal preference and cultural bias. This stems mainly from the age-old arguments positing a mind-body split that gives value to what is seen as \"intellectual\" over what is seen as personal, idiosyncratic, unquantifiable; and 'normalized\" over what is seen as ambiguous, peculiar, outlying. This situation presents an enormous problem for design students. They may be told that their design needs improvement, but they do not really know the why or what's next, nor do they know how to remedy the problem. Students need tools to help them reflect on their design, advance it, interact with it, change it, then interact with the change. While modern technology has provided us with the means to cut down on laborious, energy-draining tasks of drawing and re-drawing, it has perhaps inadvertently over-simplified the design process. We have lost the steps where discovery can take place - the computer does them for us. In this dissertation, I propose one way to address the current state of the problem - especially in the hands-on practice-based design studio and project-based design courses - by employing the principles of shape grammar theory. The use of shape grammars in design education can help students grow as designers and put them back in touch with their unique and instantaneous responses to emerging designs; in other words, shape grammars can help students \"feel their way\" toward better designs by providing them with a set of actions that can be applied.

    "abstract": "It is important to predict indoor environment in order to design thermally comfortable and healthy indoor spaces. Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) design engineers and architects widely use the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technique for indoor environment predictions. The CFD technique requires a turbulence model to correctly calculate indoor air distribution. However, the currently available turbulence models in the literature are either inaccurate or inefficient for the indoor environment predictions. To solve the problem, this thesis proposes two two-layer turbulence models and a zero-equation turbulence model. The two-layer models use a one-equation (k) model for the near wall region and the \"standard\" k -£ model in the outer region. The zero-equation model calculates turbulent viscosity based on local velocity and a length-scale. The near wall models have been developed with the aid of the data of natural and forced convection flows by Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), while the zero-equation model has been proposed empirically. One of the two-layer turbulence models is used for predicting natural convection in rooms. The other two-layer model and the zero-equation model can be used to predict forced, natural, and mixed convection in rooms. These three new models have been applied to predict different types of indoor airflows. The corresponding DNS or experimental data were used to validate the models. This study concludes that the two-layer models can predict airflows most accurately, better than many k -E models. The computing cost is significantly lower than that of the low Reynolds number k-E models and is only slightly higher than that of the \"standard\" k-E models. The zero-equation model is at least ten times faster than the \"standard\" k-E model and it is numerically stable and can predict indoor airflow with acceptable accuracy.",

    "abstract": "The following thesis explores two central hypotheses. On the one hand it introduces the idea of performative architecture (performance in design), and has done so with the desire to contribute directly to the expansion of design education and practice. It proposes stretch the boundaries of the discipline by challenging current paradigms on architectural theory and practice by conveying an axiom of active engagement between artifacts and their environments with human users/inhabitants forming part of such an environment. Performance is here proposed as the action that mediates the two forces of artifice and environment. The second hypothesis of this thesis has been to offer a distinct point of view regarding analogue relations-as asserted by this work-between the design process-as it relates to pedagogy and practice-and the performance of design (considered through that which is built, materialized and produced) as it engages with its surroundings. Designing requires fundamental ambiguity, imposing both theoretically and empirically, a methodological systematization of two recurrent and consequent processes: mergence and emergence. I will describe how both, explained by Shape Grammars design theory, are complimentary and interdependent processes, mergence in order to produce the essential ambiguity required and emergence in order to embed and operate, and that this processes are present both during the design process (designing) and during the experience of design (inhabiting/using). These two hypotheses temporarily blur the distinction between environment and design artifact, or between natural and artificial, and propose a displacement of these distinctions towards the performance of the interfaces between such conditions, independent of their \"natural\" or \"artificial\" transient connotations. I will describe how this manifold notion of performance can be used to understand this displacement in architectural discourse, and its practical implications towards a performative architecture.",

    "abstract": "Acoustic design is a difficult problem, because the human perception of sound depends on such things as decibel level, direction of propagation, and attenuation over time, none of which are tangible or visible. The advent of computer simulation and visualization techniques for acoustic design and analysis has yielded a variety of approaches for modeling acoustic performance. However, current computer-aided design and simulation tools suffer from two major drawbacks. First, obtaining the desired acoustic effects may require a long, tedious sequence of modeling and/or simulation steps. Second, current techniques for modeling the propagation of sound in an environment are prohibitively slow and do not support interactive design. This thesis presents a new approach to computer-aided acoustic design. It is based on the inverse problem of determining material and geometric settings for an environment from a description of the desired performance. The user interactively indicates a range of acceptable material and geometric modifications for an auditorium or similar space, and specifies acoustic goals in space and time by choosing target values for a set of acoustic measures. Given this set of goals and constraints, the system performs an optimization of surface material and geometric parameters using a combination of simulated annealing and steepest descent techniques. Visualization tools extract and present the simulated sound field for points sampled in space and time. The user manipulates the visualizations to create an intuitive expression of acoustic design goals. We achieve interactive rates for surface material modifications by preprocessing the geometric component of the simulation, and accelerate geometric modifications to the auditorium by trading accuracy for speed through a number of interactive controls. We describe an interactive system that allows flexible input and display of the solution and report results for several performance spaces.",

    "abstract": "This dissertation examines a building program for Fascist headquarters, or Case del Fascio, established by the Partito Nazionale Fascista (PNF) during the years of Italian Fascism, from 1922 to 1943. The PNF planned over 11,000 buildings by 1943 on the Italian mainland and in their colonial territories. This examination is a chronological study of these buildings demonstrating that the PNF expressed its political messages in built-form. Between 1919 and 1943, the PNF developed its political ideology, documented in the Statute of 1921, and its modifications in 1926, 1929, 1932, and 1938. The PNF building program mirrored their constantly modified political goals, as well as the PNF's decisions in areas of culture, religion, and foreign policy. The physical form of the Casa del Fascio embodied the PNF's evolving character that changed from fringe to progressive, to dominant, to authoritarian and militaristic. While the politicians developed programmatic needs for the PNF headquarters building, many architects developed their own consensus about its design from articles in their professional periodicals. Journalists featured PNF sponsored competitions for Case del Fascio, Palazzi del Littorio, and Torri Littorie - all versions or components of the developing headquarters building. Wide spread participation of architects in national competitions for fascist headquarters allowed architects to observe other solutions and offer their interpretations. Articles and newsreels of building inaugurations aided the architect's view of the PNF's preferred examples. What began as a clandestine meeting space evolved into a building that could be identified at a distance as a Casa del Fascio - a symbol of the PNF, if not Mussolini, himself. However, no one model stood as the template for the new political building. Variations in form, plan configuration, and aesthetics continued until the PNF's 1943 demise, despite the 1936 \"Declaration of the Empire\" and the PNF's association with Germany - which would have suggested a government-sanctioned \"monumental Roman\" model. The outcome reveals that architects had unusually strong design control. My study is a chronological analysis, using over 4,000 architectural examples, overlaid with the changing ideology of the PNF, which reveals the reactive design interpretations by professional architects during the Ventennio.",

    "abstract": "This dissertation documents how the aesthetic dimension of architecture came to be seen as an object of public utility in late nineteenth and early twentieth century France. It examines the work of a network of architects, artists, political representatives, art critics, poets, archaeologists, pedagogues, and other intellectual elites, who argued, through journals, pamphlets and books, and various legislative debates, that architecture's aesthetic capacity could both remedy public problems and reform the public itself. The study casts these \"aesthetic reformers\" as motivated not only by a wish to serve the public, but moreso by a desire to serve architecture itself, rehabilitating its social status through claims to its own utility. Drawing forth the influence of contemporary theories of philosophical aesthetics, psychology, and pedagogy on these aesthetic reformers, I demonstrate how they concluded that architecture's social utility lay in its ability to improve the morality of the French public. The project argues that this conclusion accordingly reoriented architecture's focus to from the building itself, to the city, and finally to entirety of the environment over the course of approximately forty years, as architecture became increasingly invested in its relationship to the public. I substantiate this argument through studies of private associations and societies which collectively sought to intensify the aesthetic affect of the built environment through the preservation of both buildings and natural features, the promotion of architecture as a form of art for the public, and the new practice of urban planning. In bringing this moment when architecture's aesthetics were conceived as public utility to light, my study offers a new genealogy of the idea that architecture could better society.",

    "title": "Estimating material and energy intensities of urban areas",
    "abstract": "The objective of this thesis is to develop methods to estimate, analyze and visualize the resource intensity of urban areas. Understanding the resource consumption of the built environment is particularly relevant in cities that are rapidly growing, as the urban forms that emerge have long-term consequences for both the quality of life of the inhabitants, and their future material and energy demands. This work was completed by assembling datasets of cities from around the world, identifying geometric patterns in the built environment, relating these geometric patterns to material and energy intensities, and illustrating these intensities in a visually intuitive way. This thesis describes a standardized analytical approach to assess the physical characteristics of the built environment, enabling comparisons to be made between cities. This approach provides a preliminary assessment of resource intensities that may be useful for decision-makers to compare differences among a variety of urban forms.

    "text": "Estimating material and energy intensities of urban areas The objective of this thesis is to develop methods to estimate, analyze and visualize the resource intensity of urban areas. Understanding the resource consumption of the built environment is particularly relevant in cities that are rapidly growing, as the urban forms that emerge have long-term consequences for both the quality of life of the inhabitants, and their future material and energy demands. This work was completed by assembling datasets of cities from around the world, identifying geometric patterns in the built environment, relating these geometric patterns to material and energy intensities, and illustrating these intensities in a visually intuitive way.

    "title": "Guided growth : design and computation of biologically active materials",
    "abstract": "In this dissertation, I propose ways for designers and architects to engage with the material units of biological computation and fabrication, namely the living cells. Microscopic cells, the basic units of life, are bits of material with embedded computation, fabrication, and regulation mechanisms. Their genetic code in the DNA performs complex computations, allowing cells to grow, interact with their environment through exchange of matter and energy, and even produce structural materials such as cellulose. These materials are renewable, self-assembling, self-healing, and biologically active. Our rapidly growing ability to re-program living cells to produce materials they would not produce in their natural state presents future possibilities as far-reaching as growing houses from seeds. This dissertation explores synthetic biology as a computational method to program cells so as to grow biologically active materials for architecture, with the possibility of designing them for new functions, including air filtering and purification, self-repair, and photosynthesis. To realize the potential for biologically active materials, I propose a Guided Growth design process, using the cellulose-producing bacterium Gluconacetobacter xylinus as an example. The Guided Growth design process employs three scales of resolution: nano (engineered living cells), meso (biomaterials that inhabit cells), and macro (bio-computational interface): · Nano-scale, the nanometer scale of DNA design: using tools of synthetic biology, I program the behavior of bacterial cells to respond to changes in their environment and pattern their function and properties. · Meso-scale, the micro- to centimeter scale of guided material self-assembly: using tools of materials science, I develop workflows to grow, shape, harvest, and process living-non-living composite biofilms, while keeping the bacteria cells alive and biologically active. · Macro-scale, the centimeter and up scale of bio-computational interface: using tools of digital fabrication, I design and fabricate a bio-computational interface that through computationally regulated flow of nutrients, added substances, and air allows the designer to interact with the process of growth. In the Guided Growth design process, I collaborate with synthetic biologists and computational designers to integrate the rigor of scientific research and the openness of material-based explorations. This multiscale collaborative process can be further generalized to other material systems where programmed living cells act as matter-organizing agents. My experimental methodology proposes new ways of computational making in architecture, a new class of biologically active materials, and a new application domain for synthetic biology.",

    "abstract": "The thesis investigates the geodesic structure and dome phase in the corpus of Richard Buckminster Fuller's artifactual production and writings. It offers a history of the meteoric rise of the geodesic structure, its production, deployment, reception and subsequent marginalization. The geodesic work, as a pinnacle of Fuller's life work, form a multi-layered symbolic project with significance that extends beyond architecture. While the geodesic dome is an aspect of Fuller's many artifactual productions, it is studied here as a culmination of a set of ideas that Fuller developed and refined over a course of forty years, beginning with the 4D-Dymaxion House. These ideas represent a set of poignant observations and critique of design and design practices in particular, and of contemporary American culture in general. At a cursory level, Fuller's invention of the geodesic dome in the late forties appears to be a historical aberration, given the traditional, deeply symbolic significance of the dome and the fairly entrenched modem aesthetic sensibility based on planes and asymmetry. Yet, over a period of twenty years, the geodesic invention reinvigorated a traditional archetypal form besides charging up new interests in all types of space-frame structures. The invention of the geodesic structure invention enjoyed professional attention and rallied public enthusiasm. However, with its swan-song at the Montreal Expo '67, it was quickly eclipsed and marginalized. The thesis shows that Fuller's geodesic work is an attempt to create a seamless continuity between nature and society, following on the heels of his first attempt (in the 4D-Dymaxion House phase) to create a similar continuity between society and industry and between production and consumption. To understand anyone of these aspects, one must posit the invention in the context of its inventor and the relationship of the desires he brought to bear on American society and culture in his time.",

The setting of these stations gave rise to a manner of occupation, both in the sense of physical inhabitation and of intellectual orientation, distinct from but related to the cultural institutions of the city.

In examining the architectural, visual, and scientific components of this double program, the dissertation reveals a profound connection between the domestic and natural economies which ordered these places of research. This connection, I argue, provides the basis for a new understanding of ordering space on the related scales of architecture, landscape, and region. The first part of the study identifies a moment of cultural criticism in which a group of naturalists vacated the existing edifice of knowledge. Physically and intellectually abroad in a new field of research, their efforts to accommodate themselves there constituted a particular understanding of place in the production of knowledge. A tension between mobile and fixed modes of experiencing place determined the structural features of these accommodations. This tension is shown to be an important conceptual feature of nineteenth-century architectural, historic, and scientific accounts of man's place in nature. The second part of the study presents the thesis that these stations did not merely facilitate a research discipline but served as its premise. Focusing on the development of two stations which were \"annexes\" of the Paris Sorbonne, it shows how they were shaped by a practical and political bias against scientific institutions conceived as monuments.

    "abstract": "The safety and assessment of historic masonry structures continues to be a challenge for most analysts, especially for more complex buildings. Historic masonry structures have great cultural and economic value, but engineers have not examined the collapse modes for many masonry elements. This thesis examines the collapse of unreinforced masonry structures in response to large support displacements and constant horizontal ground accelerations. Two different structural forms are studied and collapse conditions are established for each. The aim of this research is to allow simple, but meaningful, analytical models and experimental results to inform each other in an effort to better define masonry collapse mechanisms. The first structural form to be analyzed is the masonry dome. For historical masonry domes, small outward movements of the supports will cause cracking and may lead to collapse. The critical span increase to cause collapse of a hemispherical dome is determined for domes with varying thicknesses using two small-scale physical models. In addition, the critical value of constant horizontal acceleration to cause collapse of a hemispherical dome is also examined, simulated by tilting the two domes on a plane. In both cases, a mechanism forms, rendering the dome unstable and collapse ensues. Simple analytical models, emphasizing the relationship between geometry and equilibrium, are able to accurately predict the failure limits and mechanisms. The second structural form to be analyzed is the curving masonry wall. In an effort to better understand the origins and perceived benefits of curving masonry walls, their stability is measured relative to the amount of curvature in the wall. The critical value of constant horizontal acceleration to cause collapse of a curving wall is determined using multiple equilibrium methods and compared with both full-scale and small-scale experiments for dry-stacked bricks. Based on these results, new limits for the stability of these structures are proposed.",

    "abstract": "The dissertation is a history of Louis Sullivan's Carson-Pirie-Scott Building in Chicago, originally the Schlesinger and Mayer Store, built 1899- 1904. Carson-Pirie-Scott was the last major structure designed by Sullivan and has long been considered a pivotal work in the history of modern architecture. The study documents the origins of Sullivan's design in the context of the architecture and urban development of Chicago's main shopping street, State Street. As one of a number of department stores built. along this commercial street in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Carson-Pirie-Scott was at the center of a transformation of urban life. Rapid change in the scale and character of commercial architecture on State Street was linked to changes in retailing practice, building technology, and transportation. The thesis shows how designs for department stores by architects such as Jenney and Mundie, Burnham and Root, and Holabird and Roche responded to these distinctly modern conditions. Adler and Sullivan's early renovations of a pre-existing Schlesinger and Mayer Store and the character of the client firm are studied in relation to Sullivan's drawings and the executed scheme for the new building. Carson-Pirie-Scott is analyzed in relation to the culture of shopping and the architecture of commercial streets as these had developed in Chicago and elsewhere by the turn of the century. Sullivan's design was linked to the development of the show window as a mode of decorative art, and to the emergence of the department store as a new use type with both modern and festive associations. Carson-Pirie-Scott's exterior and special interior spaces responded to expectations for the architecture of these commercial institutions. Sullivan's building is compared to earlier development of the department store in New York and Paris, as well as neighboring stores on State Street. As a work representative of its place and period, Carson-Pirie-Scott also emerged from a regional school of architectural thought. Reconstruction of the theoretical position of Sullivan and his Chicago contemporaries shows how their understanding of their art may have developed from that of earlier theorists of the 19th century, including Ruskin, Semper, and Viollet-le-Duc. Analysis of the writings of Sullivan, Adler, Root, Jenney, and Wright also suggests how their view of architecture was linked to fundamental changes in the practice of building in Chicago in the late 19th century. Their attitude toward the possibility of a new art and craft of the machine may be under stood as a response to the rapid development of both materials and techniques of commercial construction. Sullivan's attempt to work creatively with these new conditions of his art is demonstrated in the design of Carson-Pirie-Scott. There is a final assessment of the building in relation to Sullivan 's development as an architect. Study of selected earlier works, including the Rothschild Store, the Wainwright Building, the Chicago Stock Exchange Building, the Gage facade, and the later Van Allen Store lends comparative perspective on the place of Carson-Pirie-Scott within Sullivan's oeuvre .

    "abstract": "This dissertation presents a new approach to structuring global diversity for a large number of urban water systems, so that trends observed in a small number of cases can contribute to a more general understanding of the spectrum of contemporary sustainability challenges faced by cities around the world. The two-part approach first uses a large number of cities (large-n, i.e. n = 142) to identify a typology which is used to guide the choice of two cases (small-n, i.e. n = 2) for further analysis. In the first part of the approach, I compare a large number (large-n) of urban water systems. Simple profiles of key attributes of urban water supply and demand-population (N), water use intensity (WN), and net annual water balance data (qNet)-are assembled from common global databases.

    "text": "International comparative analysis of urban water systems This dissertation presents a new approach to structuring global diversity for a large number of urban water systems, so that trends observed in a small number of cases can contribute to a more general understanding of the spectrum of contemporary sustainability challenges faced by cities around the world. The two-part approach first uses a large number of cities (large-n, i.e. n = 142) to identify a typology which is used to guide the choice of two cases (small-n, i.e. n = 2) for further analysis. In the first part of the approach, I compare a large number (large-n) of urban water systems.

    "abstract": "Broadly stated, this dissertation focuses on how practitioners and provider organizations integrate the computer and web into healthcare delivery. The opportunity that afforded this research was a Telemedicine Needs Assessment commissioned by a Massachusetts-based provider organization, consisting of two hospitals and 29 community group practices (CGP). The Telemedicine Needs Assessment incorporated qualitative and quantitative research programs to include: 1. cross-sectional, institution-wide, in-depth interviews; 2. participant observation at administrative and clinical day-to-day operations, and lastly, 3. a 68 item, closed-ended survey distributed to all 586 clinical practitioners to assess the access, use, and perceived needs of current computer, web, and telemedicine technologies. Data from the survey, (72% response rate), established a computer and web enablement baseline against which the success, failure, or potential usefulness of any future medical informatics implementation would be evaluated. Findings included: 1. Computer and web enablement within the organization is not ubiquitous. Access is high, use is low; 2. Practitioner status, practice location, and gender affect enablement. Non-MDs, CGP-based practitioners, and female practitioners report lowest access and use. 3. No differences were reported specific to home access to computers and use of e-mail. 4. Hospital-based practitioners report greater access and use. CGP-based practitioners report greater perceived needs for teletechnologies.",

    "abstract": "Building materials and furnishings emit a wide variety of indoor pollutants, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs). At present, no accurate models are available to characterize material emissions and sorption under realistic indoor conditions. The objective of this thesis is to fill that gap. Using the emission data measured in small-scale and full-scale environmental chambers, this investigation has developed a numerical model for simulating emissions of \"wet\" materials applied to porous substrates. This model considers VOC mass transfer processes in the air, material-air interface, material film, and the substrate. The model can predict \"wet\" material emissions under different environmental conditions (i.e., temperature, velocity, turbulence, and VOC concentration in the air) with reasonable accuracy. We developed two models for simulating VOC emissions from dry materials. One is a numerical model for short-term predictions, the other is an analytical model for long-term predictions. The models have been successfully used to examine the VOC emissions from two particleboard samples and a polypropene Styrene-Butadiene Rubber (SBR) carpet. A VOC sorption model has also been developed to analytically solve the VOC sorption rate as a function of air-phase concentrations. The model has been validated using an analytical solution as well as data obtained from sorption experiments. The emission and sorption models that we developed have been further used to study indoor air quality (IAQ) in a small office with different ventilation systems. The results show that displacement ventilation may not provide better IAQ than mixing systems if the VOC sources are from the floor. Further, our study shows sink effects from internal walls of gypsum board.",

    "abstract": "This dissertation concerns the extensive building program which Henri IV undertook in Paris from 1600 to 1610. Focusing on the place Royale (now called the place des Vosges) , the place Dauphine, rue Dauphine, and Pont Neuf, and the hôpital St. Louis, this study holds that Henri IV's urbanism was guided by an emerging view of the city as a unified entity. Drawing from newly uncovered notarial documents, the dissertation examines the form and the function of the monuments and argues that each building was embedded in its physical context, engaged in the life of the city, and informed by an underlying urban vision . First, the buildings were not autonomous geometric forms dropped into open spaces; they were conceived as parts of a larger urban composition, structured by axes which linked the monuments to major roads without however diminishing the quality of spatial enclosure which the designs also promoted. Second, the squares and the hospital were each charged with a program anchored in the commercial, social, and sanitary life of the city. The place Royale and place Dauphine were planned as residential and commercial squares to stimulate trade and manufacturing while the hôpital St. Louis was intended to minimize the convulsive effect of the plague on the city. Finally, the dissertation argues that the royal building program was not merely a sequence of unrelated improvements and isolated adornments, but rather a series of coordinated efforts to impose a unifying order on the city. The monuments were assigned functions which addressed the city as a whole . They were physically linked to more distant parts of the city, and they were composed to create grand urban vistas. The urban fabric was no long e r conceived as an accumulation of fragments contained within the walls; it was understood as a cohesive network with its own internal order.",
