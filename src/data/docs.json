    "abstract": "It has been assumed that Ca2+ influx of different duration and amplitude would generate different level of potentiation. The conventional protocols of generating LTP have been 1. tetanic stimulation of presynaptic cell, 2. theta burst stimulation of presynaptic cell, and 3. correlated stimulation of pre- and post-synaptic cells. However, the effects of different Ca2+ influx can not be precisely dissected with the conventional protocols for the following defects: 1. the protocols do not discriminate between pre- and post-synaptic side plasticity, 2. the protocols observe synaptic plasticity between two cells which involve multiple synapses with heterogeneous properties, 3. precise control and measurement of the amount of Ca2+ influx are not possible in the protocols. In the present experiment, we perfused glutamate directly on to a single postsynaptic site, depolarized the postsynaptic intracellular potential to a controlled voltage for a controlled duration of time, thus controlling the opening of postsynaptic NMDA receptors and Ca2+ influx. By using this method, we found 1. that modification of synaptic strength has a bell-shaped dependency to the amount of Ca2+ influx, 2. that weak Ca2+ current through desensitized NMDA receptors sustained for a long period of time (160 ms) generates LTD, 3. evidence that phosphorylation of AMPAR leads to insertion of AMPAR.",

Under an X-linked mode of inheritance, the DYT3 haplotype occurs in Filipino populations and is of the highest frequency in the Panay Islands of the Philippines.

TAF1, the largest of fourteen TAF proteins, incorporates into a TATA binding complex that promotes transcription by RNA polymerase II. In a collaborative effort, singleplex BaseScope\" probes as well as antibodies have been produced to target two TAF1 isoforms, canonical TAF1, C-TAF1, and neuronal TAF1, N-TAF1, separately. N-TAF1 differs from C-TAF1 by the inclusion of a two amino acid microexon, 3' to the SVA insertion, known as 34'. Here, I show that N-TAF1 expression is confined to neurons and interneurons whereas C-TAF1 is widely expressed, particularly by astrocytes, interneurons, neurons, and cells present in other organs including the heart and liver in mouse. Additionally, the antibodies produced show promise for use in human tissue. These results support the hypothesis that C-TAF1 and N-TAF1 have canonical and neuron-specific functions, respectively, and misregulation of N-TAF1 is capable of causing neuronal degeneration.

    "abstract": "State failure is becoming increasingly prevalent across the globe, creating human suffering, black markets, lost economic opportunities, and safe havens for militant actors. It is imperative that the international community find a way to combat state failure. This study investigates the effects of irregular leadership transitions on state failure recovery. Irregular leadership transitions occur when the executive of a state comes to power through unconstitutional means. Regular leaders are more likely than irregular leaders to have personal experience as a ruler, beneficial domestic and international ties, and familiarity among the population. Irregular transitions may damage bureaucracies, damaging government functionality and halting development projects that had already been underway. Regular leaders benefit from a legacy that was likely able to pass spoils onto an elite group. This elite group is likely to resist relative losses to power more than lower status groups would fight to gain power because of the cognitive principles of risk aversion, and the sensitivity to status inherent to social identity theory. Regular leaders also have traditional legitimacy, while irregular leaders are more likely to have to gain legitimacy. State failure and failure recovery are overdetermined, so it is impossible to be able to confidently determine the direction of causal flow. Every determinant of failure is related to every other, and it is difficult to separate their effects. The role of leadership regularity is therefore investigated as a proxy that can predict variation on the rate of failure recovery. The quantitative analysis consisted of multi and bivariate regressions investigating the effects of leadership regularity on failure duration, as well as the relative explanatory power held by several factors associated with leadership regularity. Robustness checks were performed using Bayesian statistics, and survival analyses. Irregular leadership transitions were found to predict a roughly five year increase in state failure duration. The Afghan Civil War was used as an illustrative case, describing the ways in which Daoud, Taraki, Amin, Karmal, Massoud, Hekmatyar, and Mullah Omar all overcame, or failed to overcome, different obstacles associated with their irregularity and how these obstacles affected their relative levels of success attempting to extend governance.",

Novel methods were developed to confirm the dorsoventral level of tetrodes at intermediate stages of advancement during recording, and to reconstruct estimated directions and distances of recorded sources from tetrodes by post-hoc analysis.

A set of experiments is proposed to investigate how dorsolateral striatal neuronal activity changes in correlation with learning of three stimulus-response tasks relative to three control tasks with similar sensory, motor and motivational aspects but different learning and memory requirements, and to localize task-responsive units with respect to striosomes and body part areas identified by neuronal responses to cutaneous stimulation/passive manipulation and anterograde anatomical tracers from primary motor cortex.

Optical microscopy has been a key technology for mapping brain circuits throughout the history of neuroscience due to its low cost, wide usage in biological sciences and ability to read out information-rich molecular signals. However, conventional optical microscopes have limited spatial resolution due to the diffraction limit of light, requiring a tradeoff between the density of neurons to be imaged and the ability to resolve finer structures. A new technology called expansion microscopy (ExM), which physically expands the specimen multiple times before optical imaging, enables us to image fine structures of biological tissues with super resolution using conventional optical microscopes. With the help of ExM, we can also read out molecular information in the neural tissues optically. In this thesis, I will introduce our study of the properties, via computer simulation, of a candidate automated approach to algorithmic reconstruction of dense neural morphology, based on simulated data of the kind that would be obtained via two emerging molecular technologies-expansion microscopy (ExM) and in-situ molecular barcoding. We utilize a convolutional neural network to detect neuronal boundaries from protein-tagged plasma membrane images obtained via ExM, as well as a subsequent supervoxel-merging pipeline guided by optical readout of information-rich, cell-specific nucleic acid barcodes.

The first establishes the eye-specific laminae, A and A 1, and the second establishes ON/OFF sublaminae within laminae A and At. In contrast to eyespecific segregation, which seems to rely only on presynaptic activity, ON /OFF sublamination requires both pre- and postsynaptic activity. Because of its dependence on postsynaptic (relay cell) activity, sub lamination may be influenced by extra retinal inputs which alter relay cell excitability. We have examined the postnatal development of cholinergic brainstem inputs to the dLGN to determine whether these inputs arrive in time to influence sublamination and whether the cholinergic innervation is present in laminar zones (i.e., whether it might target relay cells). Choline acetyltransferase (ChA1) immunoreactivity is not detected in the dLGN until a few days after the second postnatal week Gust after sublamination begins), at which time it can be seen in both A and C laminae. ChA T labeling increases in intensity until two days before the end of the fourth postnatal week (when ON/OFF sublamination is complete), when it drops dramatically throughout the dLGN . ChAT labeling returns a few days later, but appears in the interlaminar and intersublaminar zones instead of within the A and C laminae. However, the pattern of ChA T labeling reverses once more, so that in the adult, ChA T labeling appears in the A and C laminae and is relatively absent from interlaminar zones. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) labeling in the dLGN shows a similar ontogenetic pattern and time course. Retrngrade labeling of brainstem cholinergic nuclei demonstrates that these inputs are in place in the dLGN after the second postnatal week.

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) labeling in the dLGN shows a similar ontogenetic pattern and time course. Retrngrade labeling of brainstem cholinergic nuclei demonstrates that these inputs are in place in the dLGN after the second postnatal week. Thus, cholinergic inputs to A and A 1 laminae of the ferret dLG N do arrive in time to influence ON/OFF sublamination."

    "abstract": "Precise regulation of glutamate homeostasis is critical for normal brain function, as its disruption can impair excitatory transmission and result in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Critical to maintaining glutamate homeostasis is a family of sodium-dependent glutamate transporters. GLT-1, the major glutamate transporter, is responsible for >90% of brain glutamate uptake. While previously thought to exist solely on astrocytes, the Rosenberg lab has identified GLT-1 as the major, if not only, glutamate transporter associated with excitatory terminals, particularly in CA3 pyramidal neuron axon terminals within CA3 and CA1 as well as in cortical layer V pyramidal neuron axon terminals within striatum. The specific functions of GLT-1 in axon terminals in regulating glutamate homeostasis and synaptic transmission are unknown; in order to investigate these functions, the Rosenberg lab has generated a conditional GLT- 1 KO mouse line where GLT-1 can be specifically deleted from neurons. The aim of this project was to investigate the transcriptome profiles resultant from knockout of neuronal GLT-1 (nGLT-1), within regions known to express GLT-1 on neurons, and to identify and characterize alterations in known biological pathways. I report that deletion of nGLT-1 results in a high degree of differential gene expression within CA3 (1509), CAl (322), and Striatum (1268). Furthermore, these alterations in gene expression were enriched in annotated biological pathways related to energy metabolism and neurotransmission. These findings challenge the long-held assumption that, because GLT-1 expression on neurons is significantly lower than on astrocytes, nGLT-1 contributes little to the regulation of synaptic glutamate homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Chronic stress has been linked to variation in gene regulation in the hippocampus (HIP) among other areas. These lead to cytoskeletal and volumetric rearrangements in various nuclei of the central nervous system and are thought to contribute to several stress-sensitive disorders. One such gene that has been shown to be downregulated in HIP in response to stress is somatotropin, colloquially known as growth hormone (GH). These experiments were conducted to develop a novel assay for examination of working memory in rats and explore the nature of stress-induced impairment of hippocampal function and determine whether infusion of a modified herpes simplex virus (HSV) carrying the recombinant rodent growth hormone (GH) would be sufficient to restore normal hippocampal function. After 21 days of chronic immobilization stress (CIS), animals received bilateral infusions into the dorsal HIP of 2[mu]l HSV carrying either GH with green florescent protein (GFP) or GFP only. On the second day following the infusion, the animals received trace conditioning, a HIP-dependent task, with five tone-shock pairings of a 16 second tone followed by a 30 second trace interval terminating with a 1 second 0.85 milliamp footshock. An inter-trial interval of 3 minutes was used to separate the tone-shock pairings. The following day the animals were tested for fear to the context and for fear to the tone in a novel context, measured by amount of time the animal spent freezing. Using this criterion, animals that had undergone stress that received the control vector were less likely to freeze when presented with the tone, indicating an impairment of hippocampal function. Viral-mediated overexpression of GH in the dorsal HIP was able to reverse the CIS-related impairment in hippocampal function. ELISA was used to verify the expression of GH from the infused vector. These experiments may yield future directions of investigation for stress-based disorders.",

    "abstract": "Organisms have a remarkable ability to respond to complex sensory inputs with intricate, tuned motor patterns. How does the brain organize and tune these motor responses, and are certain circuit architectures, or connectivity patterns, optimally suited for certain sensorimotor applications? This thesis presents progress towards this particular problem in three subprojects. The first section re-analyzes a large data set of single-unit recordings in zebra finch area HVC during singing. While HVC is known to be essential for proper expression of adult vocalization, its circuit architecture is contentious. Evidence is presented against the recently postulated gesture-trajectory extrema hypothesis for the organization of area HVC. Instead, the data suggest that the synaptic chain model of HVC organization is a better fit for the data, where chains of RA-projecting HVC neurons are synaptically connected to walk the bird through each time-step of the song. The second section examines how optimal sensorimotor estimation using a Bayesian inference framework could be implemented in a cerebellar circuit. Two novel behavioral paradigms are developed to assess how rats might tune their motor output to the statistics of the sensory inputs, and whether their behavior might be consistent with the use of a Bayesian inference paradigm. While neither behavior generated stable behavior, evidence indicates that rats may use a spinal circuit to rapidly and dynamically adjust motor output. The third section addresses the formation of habitual behaviors in a cortico-striatal network using rats. Stress and depression are known to significantly alter decision-making abilities, but the neural substrate of this is poorly understood. Towards this goal, rats are trained on a panel of decision-making tasks in a forced-choice T-maze, and it is shown that a chronic stress procedure produces a dramatic shift in behavior in a subset of these tasks but not the rest. This behavioral shift is reversed by optogenetic stimulation of prelimbic input to striatum, pinpointing a circuit element which may control stress-induced behavioral changes. Furthermore, a circuit hypothesis is presented to explain why sensitivity to changing reward values diminishes with overtraining.",

    "abstract": "Stressors are known to impact eating behaviors. However, recapitulating the intricate interplay between chronic stress and aberrant human eating patterns in an animal model remains a challenge. Notably, binge eating, a diagnostic feature associated with many types of eating abnormalities, particularly pertains to the binge eating disorder. To more closely investigate the etiology underlying eating behavior-associated maladaptation, the present study provides a novel and ethologically relevant animal model based on predatory odor stress. My data show that chronic stress in female mice selectively increases consumption of highly palatable, but not the regular, diet, when it is presented during a limited time following stress exposure. In addition, the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key component in the neural circuitry of reward, is also an established neural substrate susceptible to the effects of stress. Given the cellular complexity in NAc, identifying the neuronal subtypes that are selectively involved in chronic stress-elicited physiological and behavioral alterations will provide grounds for further understanding in the underlying cellular changes. Because deficits in the somatostatin (SOM) neurons have been implicated in mice exhibiting traits of anxiety and depression, this neuron subtype may play an important role in modulating negative behavioral emotionality. Here I report an abundance of somatostatin neurons, majority of which are located in the rostral-ventral region of the NAc and are activated by chronic stress exposure. Together, these results provide the first line of evidence in linking chronic stress and the somatostatin neurons within the NAc to binge eating. Further fluorescent labeling quantification and cell-type-specific optogenetic manipulation will be needed to further delineate the role of SOM neurons in orchestrating the inhibitory components of stress-modulated reward circuitry.",

    "title": "Individual differences in sentence processing",
    "abstract": "This thesis aims to elucidate shared mechanisms between retrieval in sentence processing and memory retrieval processes in nonlinguistic domains using an individual differences approach. Prior research in individual differences in sentence processing has provided conflicting evidence as to whether the same memory mechanisms operate in linguistic processing, potentially a quite specialized cognitive domain, and in other, more general areas of cognition (Just & Carpenter, 1992; Caplan & Waters, 1999). This question has been primarily addressed from the point of view of capacity-based theories of working memory (Baddeley, 1986). Under these theories, verbal working memory is either comprised of multiple components including separate components for syntactic and non-syntactic verbal processing, or is dependent on a unitary pool of resources shared across all verbal domains. However, recent memory research has suggested that the capacity-theory architecture may be incorrect. Instead of a three-part memory system composed of focal attention, working memory, and long-term memory, a better model of the memory system may be bipartite, comprising focal attention and long-term memory. In the bipartite theory, working memory is viewed as a set of mechanisms mediating between these two stores, and accurately describes empirical data (McElree, 2006). If the latter hypothesis is correct, then it follows that the bipartite system underlying sentence processing should rely on the same set of working memory mechanisms as in general memory processes. In particular, a number of empirical studies have shown that both general memory and sentence processing are subject to interference from contextually-relevant intervening elements. Such interference is thought to occur at retrieval (as opposed to encoding) both for general memory tasks (e.g., retrieving items from a list) and in sentence processing (e.g., retrieving elements in long-distance syntactic dependencies). However, no systematic attempts have been made to investigate whether this interference results from the same processing limitations. In Study 1, performance on a battery of memory and cognitive tasks is compared to performance on sentence processing tasks. One of the sentence processing tasks correlated with multiple measures likely to rely on general memory mechanisms involved in resolution of retrieval interference. However, low internal reliability of the language tasks in the first study was observed. In Study 2, a series of sentence processing tasks is examined in order to determine which tasks exhibit the highest internal reliability. The results indicate that syntactic complexity manipulations presented in null (isolated) contexts exhibit highest internal reliability and are good candidates for future studies investigating individual differences in sentence processing. Suggestions for future studies investigating shared resources between sentence processing tasks and general memory mechanism are then discussed, informed by the results from these studies.",

    "abstract": "The ability to individuate entities (i.e. conceptualize one entity as distinct from two) and trace their identity (i.e. judge that an entity is the same one as an entity encountered before) is a fundamental component of the human mind and is critical to proper name reference (i.e. a proper name, like lvfax, refers to a unique individual, namely Max). Philosophers have proposed that sortals-concepts which refer to kinds of individuals-support these abilities (Gupta, 1980; Hirsch, 1982; Macnamara, 1986; Wiggins, 1967, 1980). However, while adults may well have sortal concepts and learn proper names for individuals, it is an open question whether children do so also. Proponents of the Continuity hypothesis (e.g. Macnamara, 1982; Pinker, 1984) argue that children and adults have fundamentally the same conceptual resources, whereas proponents of the Discontinuity hypothesis (e.g. Piaget, 1954; Quine, 1960, 1969) argue that child.en and adults have qualitatively different conceptual systems. In this thesis, evidence is reviewed that very young infants have at least one sortal, physical object, which suggests that infants have the conceptual structure needed to support representations of kinds and individuals. Experiments probing infant understanding of the concept, person, suggest that infants have the ability to reason about the action and appearance of others, but data presented in the thesis falls short of providing conclusive evidence that infants under a year are able to individuate people. Evidence is presented that by age three, children represent unique individuals and interpret proper names in an adult like manner as referring to unique individuals. This rules out a discontinuity alternative, namely that preschoolers represent proper names as referring to highly similar objects or to restricted subkinds. Evidence is also presented that children as young as two years are like adults in being willing to accept a range of individuals as nameable if given information which highlights the named objects' importance, such as the attribution of mental states to the object.

    "text": "Individuation, identity and proper names in cognitive development The ability to individuate entities (i.e. conceptualize one entity as distinct from two) and trace their identity (i.e. judge that an entity is the same one as an entity encountered before) is a fundamental component of the human mind and is critical to proper name reference (i.e. a proper name, like lvfax, refers to a unique individual, namely Max). Philosophers have proposed that sortals-concepts which refer to kinds of individuals-support these abilities (Gupta, 1980; Hirsch, 1982; Macnamara, 1986; Wiggins, 1967, 1980). However, while adults may well have sortal concepts and learn proper names for individuals, it is an open question whether children do so also. Proponents of the Continuity hypothesis (e.g. Macnamara, 1982; Pinker, 1984) argue that children and adults have fundamentally the same conceptual resources, whereas proponents of the Discontinuity hypothesis (e.g. Piaget, 1954; Quine, 1960, 1969) argue that child.en and adults have qualitatively different conceptual systems. In this thesis, evidence is reviewed that very young infants have at least one sortal, physical object, which suggests that infants have the conceptual structure needed to support representations of kinds and individuals. Experiments probing infant understanding of the concept, person, suggest that infants have the ability to reason about the action and appearance of others, but data presented in the thesis falls short of providing conclusive evidence that infants under a year are able to individuate people. Evidence is presented that by age three, children represent unique individuals and interpret proper names in an adult like manner as referring to unique individuals. This rules out a discontinuity alternative, namely that preschoolers represent proper names as referring to highly similar objects or to restricted subkinds. Evidence is also presented that children as young as two years are like adults in being willing to accept a range of individuals as nameable if given information which highlights the named objects' importance, such as the attribution of mental states to the object. Together these findings provide support for the continuity hypothesis and suggest a number of avenues of research into children's understanding of kinds, individuals, and their names."

    "abstract": "I studied organizational principles that may subserve the control and learning of forelimb movements. Among these principles, I focused on muscular coordination patterns, motor cortical excitability, and sensorimotor interactions. I found that muscle activity in grasping and reaching behaviors could be reconstructed by linear combinations of a small number of time-varying muscle synergies, each fit with coefficients unique to the behavior. However, the generalization of these synergies between behavioral conditions was limited, in part by the sensitivity of the extraction algorithm to stereotyped muscular relations within contrasted conditions. In reaching studies designed to assist or resist different movement directions, I found a gradual change in the structure, as well as recruitment, of synergies. When a perturbation was targeted to the activity within a single muscle, I found a transient, relative suppression of this muscle in response to descending motor commands. In other motor cortical microstimulation experiments, I confirmed that long-train microstimulation is able to evoke complex, convergent movements. Even during highly-trained reaching movements, I found that there was relatively little invariance of the muscular patterns in relation to kinematic variables coding for the hand's displacement and velocity.",

We combined intrinsic signal imaging, visually evoked potentials, and two-photon in vivo calcium imaging to assess plasticity in juvenile and adult wild-type (WT), heterozygote, and KO mice. We find that plasticity is disrupted in the visual cortex of Arc KO mice in the absence of obvious deficits at the level of basal response properties.

    "abstract": "Complex motor behaviors in humans, such as speech, are not innate, but instead are learned. How does the brain construct neural circuits that generate these motor behaviors during learning? To understand the neural mechanisms underlying learned motor skills, I use vocal learning in songbirds as a model. While previous studies have shown that a premotor area in the songbird brain, HVC, is important for stereotyped adult song, the role of HVC in juvenile song is less known. This thesis characterizes how activity in HVC develops during song learning in juvenile birds. Early in song learning, temporal structure emerged in HVC. During the earliest vocalization of juvenile birds (subsong), HVC neurons exhibit bursts of action potentials. However, only half of the neurons show bursts that are temporally aligned to syllables, and most of these bursts are clustered around onsets of subsong syllables. Over several days, as the bird starts producing the earliest stereotyped vocalization called protosyllables, HVC neurons start exhibiting rhythmic bursts at 5-10 Hz. These rhythmic bursts are aligned to protosyllables, and bursts from different neurons are active at different latencies relative to protosyllables. Thus, as a population, HVC neurons start forming a rhythmic neural sequence. As the bird matures, multiple distinct syllable types emerge from a protosyllable. During this process, some neurons are active only during a specific syllable type ('specific neurons') while others are active during both syllable types ('shared neurons'). These shared neurons are active at similar latencies for both syllable types, and therefore form a shared neural sequence. Over development, fraction of shared neurons decrease and more neurons become specific. These results demonstrate that splitting of a neural sequence into multiple sequences underlies the emergence of a multiple syllable types. Moreover, this sequence splitting is observed during different song learning strategies, suggesting that this is a fundamental neural mechanism for song learning. This work demonstrates how the growth of a rhythmic neural sequence and its subsequence splitting gives rise to complex vocalization in songbirds.

This is because these images differ in their memorability - a predictive value of whether an image is likely to be later remembered or not. However, the properties of memorability and its effects in the brain are unexplored. Here, I describe the first characterization of the neural and psychophysical bases of memorability. First, I show that memorability is highly consistent in the domain of face images, despite their similar perceptual features and same basic-level category, and examine what facial attributes are predictive of memorability (Chapter 2). I extend these findings to demonstrate that memorability is not only consistent across images, but across different images of the same face identity (Chapter 3); thus, memorability can be conceptualized as an intrinsic property to whole entities. I then compare memorability to several phenomena shown to influence memory - bottom-up attention, top-down attention, and priming - and find that memorability effects remain independent of these phenomena (Chapter 4). Lastly, I investigate the neural correlates of memorability in a human functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment (Chapter 5). I find sensitivity to memorability in the medial temporal lobe and ventral visual stream, with a memorability-centric representational geometry in the neural patterns in these regions. Importantly, this sensitivity is dissociable from classical individual subsequent memory effects that I show to be localized in the prefrontal cortex. These results also indicate that until now, memory work has largely confounded the effects of the participant (individual memory) and the stimulus (memorability), and I propose a re-examination of past memory findings through the lens of memorability.

Multiple cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic loops are thought to function together during the learning and performance of reinforced behaviors, with the dorsolateral circuit being particularly critical for the learning of habitual chains of action sequences. However, how this circuit works to generate such behavior is poorly understood. To explore the nature of striatal neural representations during learned action sequences, I designed a task targeted at disambiguating movement-related responses from habit representations in striatum. In combination with this task, I employed electrophysiology and optogenetics techniques to characterize task-related neuronal activity in the corticostriatal circuit. I found that, unlike in motor cortex, neurons in striatum did not respond simply to particular individual actions, but responded preferentially at the initiation and termination of learned action sequences. These experiments provide a test for the existence of a generalized striatal signal marking the start and end of units of habitual behaviors which may be produced with the contribution of striatal interneurons, providing a mechanism by which striatum can control the encoding and performance of chunked action sequences. In a separate set of experiments, I explored the effect of dopamine depletion on local field potential oscillations in the same region of striatum. My goal was to investigate the interaction between abnormal oscillations caused by dopamine depletion in Parkinson's disease and the functional task-related oscillations that normally occur in healthy striatum. Against our expectations, I found that local unilateral dopamine depletion in dorsolateral striatum did not result in changes in pre-task baseline strength of oscillations, but rather in the overexpression of the normal task-related oscillations.

    "abstract": "Gamma oscillations (20-50 Hz), a common local field potential signature in many brain regions, are generated by a resonant circuit between fast-spiking (FS)-parvalbumin (PV)-interneurons and pyramidal cells. Changes in gamma oscillations have been observed in several neurological disorders. However, the relationship between gamma oscillations and cellular pathologies of these disorders is unclear. Here, we investigated this relationship using the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and found reduced behaviorally driven gamma activity before the onset of plaque formation or evidence of cognitive decline. Because of the early onset of gamma deficits, we aimed to determine if exogenous gamma manipulations could influence disease pathology progression. We discovered that optogenetically driving FS-PV-interneurons at gamma frequency (40 Hz) reduced levels of amyloid-[beta] (A[beta])₁-₄₀ and A[beta] ₁-₄₂ isoforms in the hippocampus of 5XFAD mice. Neither driving FS-PV-interneurons at other frequencies, nor driving excitatory neurons, reduced A[beta] levels. Furthermore, driving FS-PV-interneurons at 40 Hz reduced enlarged endosomes and amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage intermediates in hippocampus. Gene expression profiling revealed an induction of microglia specific genes associated with morphological transformation of microglia and increased A[beta] phagocytosis by microglia. Inspired by these observations, we designed a non-invasive light-flickering paradigm that induced 40 Hz activity in visual cortex. The light-flickering paradigm profoundly reduced A[beta]₁-₄₀ and A[beta]₁-₄₂ levels in the visual cortex of pre-depositing mice and mitigated plaque load in aged, depositing mice. A GABAA antagonist completely blocked this effect; further evidence that GABAergic signaling is essential for this neuroprotective gamma activity.

    "title": "Mechanisms of ocular dominance plasticity in the juvenile and adult mouse visual cortex",
    "abstract": "Ocular dominance (OD) plasticity is a classic example of bidirectional experience-dependent plasticity in the primary visual cortex. This form of plasticity is most robust during early postnatal development (termed the \"critical period\"), when monocular deprivation (MD) leads to a rapid weakening of responses evoked through the deprived eye followed by a delayed strengthening of non-deprived eye inputs. It has been proposed that these bidirectional changes occur as a three-stage process: first, degradation of patterned visual input weakens deprived-eye responses via homosynaptic long-term depression (LTD); this is accompanied by a shift in the plasticity modification threshold (0m) that determines the direction of synaptic plasticity, such that synaptic strengthening is favored over synaptic weakening; finally, weak open-eye responses are strengthened via the mechanisms of homosynaptic long-term potentiation (LTP). Despite the growing evidence supporting this model of experience-dependent synaptic modification, the exact molecular and synaptic mechanisms that are responsible for these processes remain controversial. In my thesis work, I address three questions. First, I attempt to parse the relative contribution of excitatory and inhibitory processes to expression of the OD shift in order to understand how deprived-eye depression is expressed in the cortex. To address this, I first induce a shift in OD with 3 days of MD and then use several pharmacological methods to shut off cortical inhibitory synaptic transmission. I demonstrate that rapid deprived-eye depression is strongly expressed at excitatory thalamocortical synapses without any influences of polysynaptic intracortical inhibition. In the second part of my work, I try to resolve the nature/identity of the molecular mechanism that underlies the regulation of [theta]m. Using a transgenic mouse model, I find that a reduction in the NR2A/B subunit ratio of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor during MD alters the qualities of OD plasticity by impairing weakening of deprived-eye inputs and enhancing strengthening of open-eye inputs. These findings suggest that NMDAR subunit composition may specify the value and the rate of adjustment of synaptic 0m, which in turn determines the bidirectional cortical response to MD. The final portion of my thesis addresses the factors that limit OD plasticity beyond the critical period. I test the hypothesis that the developmental increase in intracortical GABAergic inhibitory synaptic transmission is a fundamental restricting factor for adult cortical plasticity and demonstrate that parvalbumin-expressing fast-spiking basket cells are specifically implicated in the absence of juvenile-like deprived-eye depression in adult mice.",

In the second part of my work, I try to resolve the nature/identity of the molecular mechanism that underlies the regulation of [theta]m. Using a transgenic mouse model, I find that a reduction in the NR2A/B subunit ratio of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor during MD alters the qualities of OD plasticity by impairing weakening of deprived-eye inputs and enhancing strengthening of open-eye inputs. These findings suggest that NMDAR subunit composition may specify the value and the rate of adjustment of synaptic 0m, which in turn determines the bidirectional cortical response to MD. The final portion of my thesis addresses the factors that limit OD plasticity beyond the critical period. I test the hypothesis that the developmental increase in intracortical GABAergic inhibitory synaptic transmission is a fundamental restricting factor for adult cortical plasticity and demonstrate that parvalbumin-expressing fast-spiking basket cells are specifically implicated in the absence of juvenile-like deprived-eye depression in adult mice."

    "abstract": "Although impressionists assure us that the world is just dabs of light, we cannot help but see surfaces and contours, objects and events. How can a visual system learn to organize pixels into these higher-level structures? In this thesis I argue that perceptual organization reflects statistical regularities in the environment. When visual primitives occur together much more often than one would expect by chance, we may learn to associate those primitives and to form a perceptual group. The first half of the thesis deals with the identification of such groups at the pixel level. I show that low-level image statistics are surprisingly effective at higher-level segmentation. I present an algorithm that groups pixels by identifying meaningful co-occurrences in an image's color statistics. Consider a zebra. Black-next-to-white occurs suspiciously often, hinting that these colors have a common cause. I model these co-occurrences using pointwise mutual information (PMI). If the PMI between two colors is high, then the colors probably belong to the same object. Grouping pixels with high PMI reveals object segments. Separating pixels with low PMI marks perceived boundaries. If simple color co-occurrences can tell us about object segments, what might more complex statistics tell us? The second half of the thesis investigates high dimensional visual data, such as image patches and video frames. In high dimensions, it is intractable to directly model co-occurrences. Instead, I show that modeling PMI can be posed as a simpler binary classification problem in which the goal is to predict if two primitives occur in the same spatial or temporal context. This allows us to model PMI associations between complex inputs. I demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on three domains: discovering objects by associating image patches, discovering movie scenes by associating frames, and discovering place categories by associating geotagged photos.

    "abstract": "Despite abundant evidence that dopamine modulates medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activity to mediate diverse behavioral functions, the precise circuit computations remain elusive. One potentially unifying theoretical model by which dopamine can modulate functions from working memory to schizophrenia is that dopamine serves to increase the signal-to-noise ratio in mPFC neurons, where neuronal activity conveying sensory information (signal) are amplified relative to spontaneous firing (noise). To connect theory to biology, we lack direct evidence for dopaminergic modulation of signal-to-noise in neuronal firing patterns in vivo and a mechanistic explanation of how such computations would be transmitted downstream to instruct specific behavioral functions. Here, we demonstrate that dopamine increases signal-to-noise ratio in mPFC neurons projecting to the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) during the processing of an aversive stimulus. First, using electrochemical approaches, we reveal the precise time course of tail pinch-evoked dopamine release in the mPFC. Second, we show that dopamine signaling in the mPFC biases behavioral responses to punishment-predictive stimuli, rather than reward-predictive cues. Third, in contrast to the well-characterized mPFC-NAc projection, we show that activation of mPFC-dPAG neurons is sufficient to drive place avoidance and defensive behaviors. Fourth, to determine the natural dynamics of individual mPFC neurons, we performed single-cell projection-defined microendoscopic calcium imaging to reveal a robust preferential excitation of mPFC-dPAG, but not mPFC-NAc, neurons to aversive stimuli. Finally, photostimulation of VTA dopamine terminals in the mPFC revealed an increase in signal-to-noise ratio in mPFC-dPAG neuronal activity during the processing of aversive, but not rewarding stimuli.

    "abstract": "How does the visual system achieve stable estimates of surface properties - such as reflectance and 3D shape - across changes in the illumination? Under arbitrary patterns of illumination this problem is ill-posed. However, in the real world, illumination is not arbitrary. Here I argue that the visual system exploits the statistical regularities of real-world illuminations to achieve stable estimates of shape and surface reflectance properties. Specifically, I suggest that the visual system derives measurements from specular reflections that are (i) diagnostic of surface properties and (ii) relatively well-conserved across real-world scenes. One consequence of the theory is that the visual system does not have to estimate and explicitly 'discount' illumination to recover shape and surface reflectance. In support of this idea, subjects are shown to be good at estimating surface reflectance and 3D shape without any context to specify the surrounding scene, as long as the illumination is realistic. However, when the pattern of illumination is unrealistic, shape and surface reflectance estimation degrade in predictable ways. Systematic manipulation of illumination statistics reveals some properties of illumination that are important for surface reflectance estimation. To understand 3D shape constancy, I discuss the way that 3D surface curvature distorts the reflected world. For the special case of mirrored surfaces, I show how populations of oriented linear filters can 'read' the pattern of distortions to recover 3D surface curvatures. Finally I show that this principle applies to cases other than perfect mirrors, and can predict both successes and failures of human shape constancy as the illumination changes.",

    "title": "Interrogation and control of mammalian transcription",
    "abstract": "Gene expression is dynamic in living systems, enabling environmental adaptation and homeostasis. Transcript levels may change temporarily during distinct phases of biological processes, while longer lasting modifications to their regulatory machinery can lead to specific cell states or disease phenotypes. However, versatile and robust methods to investigate causal relationships between gene expression states and biological phenotypes remain elusive. My thesis work - divided into two main parts - has focused on the development of technologies to enable efficient, generalizable, and precise perturbation of mammalian gene expression. The first part of my research focused on the development of light-inducible transcriptional effectors (LITEs) to mediate positive and negative regulation of endogenous mammalian gene expression (Konermann et al. Nature 2013). Optical stimulation enables precise spatiotemporal control to closely match endogenous transcriptional dynamics. I engineered the LITE system based on the programmable TALE DNA binding proteins from plant pathogens in combination with the light-inducible dimer cryptochrome 2 - cibi from Arabidopsis thaliana. Light enables fast and reversible recruitment of transcriptional effector domains to the TALE bound to the endogenous target promoter through dimerization of cryptochrome 2 - cibi. I applied LITEs to control gene expression in primary neurons as well as in the mouse brain in vivo, demonstrating their potential to dissect genetic contributions to dynamic behaviors such as learning. Epigenetic regulation of transcriptional state is an additional layer of endogenous control exerted by the cell to store more permanent states such as memories. To interrogate epigenetic in addition to transcriptional dynamics, I next developed TALE-mediated targeting of 32 repressive histone effectors to alter epigenetic states in a locus-specific manner. The LITE system establishes a novel mode of optogenetic control of endogenous cellular processes and enables direct testing of the causal roles of genetic and epigenetic regulation in normal biological processes and disease states. One major limiting aspect of TALE-based transcriptional activators is the costly and labor-intensive construction of their repetitive DNA binding domains. As a result, the utility of TALEs for higher-throughput gene targeting experiments remains limited. The CRISPR nuclease Cas9, however, can be easily programmed using a short guide RNA homologous to the target genomic DNA of interest. Additionally, Cas9 can be easily converted into an RNA-guided DNA binding protein (dCas9) via inactivation of its two catalytic domains. The ease and scalability of the CRISPR-Cas9 system potentially enables systematic, genome-scale perturbation, but the magnitude of transcriptional upregulation achieved by the current generation of Cas9 transcriptional activators typically ranges from low to ineffective. In order to achieve a system where the majority of Cas9 activators are highly functional, I undertook structure-guided engineering to generate a potent, sjynergistic Cas9 activation complex (SAM) capable of mediating robust upregulation with a single sgRNA (Konermann et al., Nature, 2015) which outperforms current systems by more than two orders of magnitude. I demonstrated that these transcriptional effectors are capable of activating up to 10 genes simultaneously, allowing for understanding of complex genetic and regulatory networks. Genome-scale GOF screening approaches have largely remained limited to the use of cDNA library systems, which are costly and challenging to use in a pooled format. To overcome this limitation, I designed a genome-scale sgRNA library targeting every coding isoform from the RefSeq database (23,430 isoforms) for a final library of 70,290 guides. I next aimed to identify gain-of-function changes that can lead to the development of BRAF inhibitor resistance in BRAFV 600 mutant melanoma cells. The screen results highlighted a number of gene candidates that both confirm known BRAF inhibitor-resistance pathways and suggest novel mechanisms of action. SAM activators present a highly reliable and generalizable tool for genome-wide interrogation of gene function and interaction in diverse biological processes. Recently, we have extended the utility of the SAM system to enable bimodal control through the use of modified, truncated deadRNAs (dRNAs) (Dahlman, et al., Nature Biotechnology 2015). These dRNAs prevent nucleolytic activity of an active Cas9 nuclease and transform the wildtype enzyme into an efficient transcriptional activator when combined with the SAM activator-components. This system enables simultaneous knock-out of gene A and activation of gene B in the same cell population, enabling bidirectional interrogation of gene interaction and regulatory networks.",

I applied LITEs to control gene expression in primary neurons as well as in the mouse brain in vivo, demonstrating their potential to dissect genetic contributions to dynamic behaviors such as learning. Epigenetic regulation of transcriptional state is an additional layer of endogenous control exerted by the cell to store more permanent states such as memories. To interrogate epigenetic in addition to transcriptional dynamics, I next developed TALE-mediated targeting of 32 repressive histone effectors to alter epigenetic states in a locus-specific manner. The LITE system establishes a novel mode of optogenetic control of endogenous cellular processes and enables direct testing of the causal roles of genetic and epigenetic regulation in normal biological processes and disease states. One major limiting aspect of TALE-based transcriptional activators is the costly and labor-intensive construction of their repetitive DNA binding domains. As a result, the utility of TALEs for higher-throughput gene targeting experiments remains limited. The CRISPR nuclease Cas9, however, can be easily programmed using a short guide RNA homologous to the target genomic DNA of interest. Additionally, Cas9 can be easily converted into an RNA-guided DNA binding protein (dCas9) via inactivation of its two catalytic domains. The ease and scalability of the CRISPR-Cas9 system potentially enables systematic, genome-scale perturbation, but the magnitude of transcriptional upregulation achieved by the current generation of Cas9 transcriptional activators typically ranges from low to ineffective. In order to achieve a system where the majority of Cas9 activators are highly functional, I undertook structure-guided engineering to generate a potent, sjynergistic Cas9 activation complex (SAM) capable of mediating robust upregulation with a single sgRNA (Konermann et al., Nature, 2015) which outperforms current systems by more than two orders of magnitude. I demonstrated that these transcriptional effectors are capable of activating up to 10 genes simultaneously, allowing for understanding of complex genetic and regulatory networks. Genome-scale GOF screening approaches have largely remained limited to the use of cDNA library systems, which are costly and challenging to use in a pooled format. To overcome this limitation, I designed a genome-scale sgRNA library targeting every coding isoform from the RefSeq database (23,430 isoforms) for a final library of 70,290 guides. I next aimed to identify gain-of-function changes that can lead to the development of BRAF inhibitor resistance in BRAFV 600 mutant melanoma cells. The screen results highlighted a number of gene candidates that both confirm known BRAF inhibitor-resistance pathways and suggest novel mechanisms of action. SAM activators present a highly reliable and generalizable tool for genome-wide interrogation of gene function and interaction in diverse biological processes. Recently, we have extended the utility of the SAM system to enable bimodal control through the use of modified, truncated deadRNAs (dRNAs) (Dahlman, et al., Nature Biotechnology 2015). These dRNAs prevent nucleolytic activity of an active Cas9 nuclease and transform the wildtype enzyme into an efficient transcriptional activator when combined with the SAM activator-components. This system enables simultaneous knock-out of gene A and activation of gene B in the same cell population, enabling bidirectional interrogation of gene interaction and regulatory networks."

    "abstract": "Alterations in sensory experience can persistently modify the responses of cortical neurons. Ocular dominance (OD) plasticity, a process in which alternation of visual input induces a shift in cortical responsiveness, is an extensively studied model of such experience-dependent plasticity. However, the synaptic mechanisms underlying OD plasticity are not well understood. Recent studies revealed that both Hebbian and homeostatic mechanisms play a role in OD plasticity. Therefore, we were interested in monitoring the process of rapid plasticity at individual synapses in vivo to gain insight into the interplay of these two mechanisms. Ca2+/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a major component of the postsynaptic density. Activation of CaMKII is necessary and sufficient for LTP induction, is required for OD plasticity, and its expression pattern coincides with the site of rapid plasticity in the supragranular layers II/III of the visual cortex. Moreover, CaMKII can convert transient Ca2+ influx into a prolonged biochemical process via autophosphorylation that renders CaMKII activity Ca2+ independent. Hence, CaMKII is well suited as a reporter of synaptic activity. We previously engineered a probe, Camui, which utilizes the optical phenomenon of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), to monitor CaMKII activation. This thesis embodies the work done to improve Camui to be a better tool for in vivo reporting of CaMKII activity, as well as the use of this improved probe for in vivo detection of CaMKII activity in single spines before and after 4 hrs of monocular deprivation (MD) in the ferret visual cortex.",

In Chapter 2, I show that preschool-age children integrate information from adults' actions, outcomes, and testimony to decide how hard to try on novel tasks.

    "abstract": "Studies in the past decade have established gene expression as an inherently variable process. Accompanying this exciting finding is a fundamental question: how do physiological events, such as cell fate specification, proceed so robustly in the face of gene expression variability? In this thesis, I took a fresh attack at this question by examining the control of variability in the context of the stereotyped development of the nematode C. elegans. Specifically, I focused on the regulation of a Hox gene by the Wnt signaling pathway in a single C. elegans neuroblast. Analogous to vertebrate neural crest cells, Hox gene expression determines the migratory direction and the subsequent fate choices of cells that descend from the original neuroblast. Intrigued by the earlier observation that perturbation to Wnt signaling disrupts the wild-type stereotypy in migratory decision, I speculated that variable gene expression may underlie the partial penetrance in the mutants and subsequently questioned what mechanism safeguards against variability in the wild type. Combining single-cell transcript counting with genetic manipulation, I quantified the variability in Hox gene expression in the Q neuroblasts in both the wild type and a series of Wnt signaling mutants. Interestingly, I observed increased expression variability in a number of mutants and an overall complex relationship between expression variability and mean expression level. Distinct features in the gene expression profile embarked me on a search for network interactions, leading to the discovery of multiple novel feedback loops within the Wnt pathway. Applying computational network inference, I revealed a network of interlocking positive and negative feedback loops, which I subsequently show to have a topological advantage in dampening stochastic noise in gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Autism and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are clinically defined by the symptoms of social impairment and repetitive behavior, affecting 1 in 68 children in the United States. Because patients with ASDs typically display symptoms before the age of three, the ASDs are classically categorized as developmental disorders. One of the key questions in autism research is whether the pathology is reversible in adults. Many studies of simple sensory systems have reported that there is a distinct critical period for synaptic plasticity. This is most famously supported by the monocular deprivation studies in young kittens, which resulted in irreversible visual impairment in adulthood (Hubel and Wiesel, 1970). However, it is not clear whether this principle extends to more complicated multi-modal behavioral systems. Here we demonstrate that adult rescue can lead to improvements in selective phenotypes of ASD by generating and using a novel Shank3 conditional knock-in mouse model. Estimated to contribute to about 1% of all ASD cases, Shank3 is one of the most prominent genes associated with autism. It is a master postsynaptic scaffolding protein that mediates synaptic plasticity and remodeling by regulating many neurotransmitter receptors including NMDAR, AMPAR, and numerous actin-binding regulators. Disruptions of Shank3 in mouse models have robustly recapitulated the cardinal phenotypes of autism including anxiety, social interaction deficits, and compulsive/stereotyped behavior. By specifically expressing Shank3 in adult mice that were initially born as Shank3 knockouts, we show that deficits in the synaptic protein composition and striatal neurotransmission can be fully recovered. We developed a novel neuronal tracing technique to study the dendritic spine density, and found that the dendritic spine number is also significantly increased in the rescue condition after development. In addition, we show that while anxiety and motor coordination are not improved, social interaction and repetitive behavior can be significantly rescued. This suggests that plasticity for certain neural circuits persist into adulthood in the diseased brain, and that the underlying mechanisms for different autistic-like phenotypes have distinct properties.",

These models and their associated learning algorithms are motivated by an attempt to provide an understanding of the algorithmic principles that might underlie a child's ability to search the haystack of sentences in her language of thought to find the needle that corresponds to any specific concept. The first model takes advantage of the compositionality inherent to LOT representations, framing concept acquisition as program induction in a functional programming language; the Exploration- Compression algorithm this model motivates iteratively builds a library of useful program fragments that, when composed, restructures the search space, making more useful programs shorter and easier to find. The second model, the Infinite Knowledge Base Model (IKM), frames concept learning as probabilistic inference over the space of relational knowledge bases; the algorithm I develop for learning in this model frames this inference problem as a state-space search over abductive proofs of the learner's observed data. This framing allows us to take advantage of powerful techniques from the heuristic search and classical planning literature to guide the learner. In the final part of this thesis, I explore the behavior of the IKM on several case studies of intuitive theories from the concept learning literature, and I discuss evidence for and against it with respect to other approaches to LOT models.",

The superficial layers of the SC (sSC) receive direct visual input from retinal ganglion cells (RGC) as well as input from pyramidal cells in layer V of the ipsilateral visual cortex (VC).

In both sSC and VC, physiological and biochemical evidence indicate considerable synaptic refinement in response to EO, which occurs naturally at the end of the second postnatal week. These studies use anterograde filling of corticocollicular axons in combination with controlled eyelid opening and reclosing paradigms to compare the corticocollicular projections of age-matched eye-opened and eye-sutured littermates. Reconstructions of individual corticocollicular axons in rat pups and statistically sampled arborization patterns across the colliculus at set times before and after controlled eye-lid opening, show that the onset of pattern vision is critical for the establishment of registration between the cortical and collicular maps of visual space. Moreover, if pattern vision is delayed by prolonging eye-lid closure the cortical projection withdraws to single axon cylinders.

However, it is unclear what neural mechanisms give rise to these limits to visual short-term memory capacity. Here, we measured neural activity in a change localization task, in which monkeys viewed two displays of multiple colored squares separated by a brief delay, and made a saccade to the square that changed color between displays. In chapter 2, we examine local field potentials in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP), frontal eye field, and lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). At stimulus encoding, lower frequency oscillations decreased in power in proportion to the total number of stimuli presented, while higher frequency oscillations increased in power in proportion to the number of stimuli contralateral to the recording site. During the delay, lower frequency power instead increased with the number of contralateral stimuli, while higher frequency power was not modulated. We interpret these findings in terms of roles for low- and high-frequency oscillations in changing and maintaining cognitive state. In chapter 3, we compare spiking activity between LIP, PFC, and inferotemporal cortex (IT). Although the task required that the animal remember stimulus colors, activity in LIP and PFC primarily reflected the stimulus positions, while activity in IT primarily reflected color. In PFC, color information increased with the number of stimuli presented, while in IT, color information remained constant or decreased. Thus, IT was more strongly capacity-limited than PFC. Color selectivity during the delay was weak in all regions. However, in IT, activity at test stimulus presentation reflected the difference in square colors between the sample and test displays, while in PFC, activity primarily reflected the location of the changed square. Selectivity to these attributes was stronger on correct trials than incorrect trials. Our findings suggest a possible role for passive processes in IT in visual short-term memory.",

The clinical patient features of RTT are most commonly reported to emerge between the ages of 6-18 months and as such, RTT has largely been considered to be a postnatal disorder. The vast majority of cases are caused by sporadic mutations in the gene encoding methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), which is expressed in the brain during prenatal neurogenesis and continuously throughout adulthood. MeCP2 is a pleiotropic gene that functions as a complex, high-level transcriptional modulator. It both regulates and is regulated by coding genes and non-coding RNAs including microRNAs (miRNAs). The effects of MeCP2 are mediated by diverse signaling, transcriptional, and epigenetic mechanisms. Whereas the postnatal effects of MeCP2 have been widely studied, pre-symptomatic stages of RTT have yet to be thoroughly investigated. Recent evidence from our lab among others suggests a role for MeCP2 during prenatal neurogenesis that may contribute to the neuropathology observed later in life. We sought to characterize the course of neurogenesis in MeCP2-deficient human neurons with the use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from RTT patient skin samples. We generated a variety of monolayer and 3D neuronal models and found that RTT phenotypes are present at the earliest stages of brain development including neuroepithelial expansion, neural progenitor migration and differentiation, and later stages of membrane and synaptic physiological development. We established a link between MeCP2 and key microRNAs that are misregulated in RTT and lie upstream of signalling pathways that contribute to aberrant neuronal maturation in the absence of MeCP2. We have uncovered novel roles of MeCP2 in human neurogenesis. Whereas the processes that comprise early neural development were previously considered irrelevant to RTT pathology, the deficits we observed in neuronal differentiation, migration, and maturation are a crucial component to the larger picture of RTT pathogenesis and provide additional insight into the emergence of RTT patient symptoms.",

Optimal transport distances capture an intuitive notion of similarity between distributions, by incorporating the underlying geometry of the domain of the distributions. Despite their intuitive appeal, optimal transport distances are often difficult to apply in practice, as computing them requires solving a costly optimization problem. In each setting studied here, we describe a numerical method that overcomes this computational bottleneck and enables scaling to real data. In the first part, we consider the problem of multi-output learning in the presence of a metric on the output domain. We develop a loss function that measures the Wasserstein distance between the prediction and ground truth, and describe an efficient learning algorithm based on entropic regularization of the optimal transport problem. We additionally propose a novel extension of the Wasserstein distance from probability measures to unnormalized measures, which is applicable in settings where the ground truth is not naturally expressed as a probability distribution. We show statistical learning bounds for both the Wasserstein loss and its unnormalized counterpart. The Wasserstein loss can encourage smoothness of the predictions with respect to a chosen metric on the output space. We demonstrate this property on a real-data image tagging problem, outperforming a baseline that doesn't use the metric. In the second part, we consider the probabilistic inference problem for diffusion processes. Such processes model a variety of stochastic phenomena and appear often in continuous-time state space models. Exact inference for diffusion processes is generally intractable. In this work, we describe a novel approximate inference method, which is based on a characterization of the diffusion as following a gradient flow in a space of probability densities endowed with a Wasserstein metric. Existing methods for computing this Wasserstein gradient flow rely on discretizing the underlying domain of the diffusion, prohibiting their application to problems in more than several dimensions. In the current work, we propose a novel algorithm for computing a Wasserstein gradient flow that operates directly in a space of continuous functions, free of any underlying mesh. We apply our approximate gradient flow to the problem of filtering a diffusion, showing superior performance where standard filters struggle. Finally, we study the ecological inference problem, which is that of reasoning from aggregate measurements of a population to inferences about the individual behaviors of its members. This problem arises often when dealing with data from economics and political sciences, such as when attempting to infer the demographic breakdown of votes for each political party, given only the aggregate demographic and vote counts separately. Ecological inference is generally ill-posed, and requires prior information to distinguish a unique solution. We propose a novel, general framework for ecological inference that allows for a variety of priors and enables efficient computation of the most probable solution.

    "abstract": "In this thesis, we present three image estimation and enhancement algorithms inspired by human vision. In the first part of the thesis, we propose an algorithm for mapping one image to another based on the statistics of a training set. Many vision problems can be cast as image mapping problems, such as, estimating reflectance from luminance, estimating shape from shading, separating signal and noise, etc. Such problems are typically under-constrained, and yet humans are remarkably good at solving them. Classic computational theories about the ability of the human visual system to solve such under-constrained problems attribute this feat to the use of some intuitive regularities of the world, e.g., surfaces tend to be piecewise constant.

    "text": "Perceptually inspired image estimation and enhancement In this thesis, we present three image estimation and enhancement algorithms inspired by human vision. In the first part of the thesis, we propose an algorithm for mapping one image to another based on the statistics of a training set. Many vision problems can be cast as image mapping problems, such as, estimating reflectance from luminance, estimating shape from shading, separating signal and noise, etc. Such problems are typically under-constrained, and yet humans are remarkably good at solving them. Classic computational theories about the ability of the human visual system to solve such under-constrained problems attribute this feat to the use of some intuitive regularities of the world, e.g., surfaces tend to be piecewise constant.

    "abstract": "I explore the hypothesis that the universal properties of human languages can be explained in terms of efficient communication given fixed human information processing constraints. I argue that under short-term memory constraints, optimal languages should exhibit information locality: words that depend on each other, both in their interpretation and in their statistical distribution, should be close to each other in linear order. The informationtheoretic approach to natural language motivates a study of quantitative syntax in Chapter 2, focusing on word order flexibility. In Chapter 3, I show comprehensive corpus evidence from over 40 languages that word order in grammar and usage is shaped by working memory constraints in the form of dependency locality: a pressure for syntactically linked words to be close. In Chapter 4, I develop a new formal model of language processing cost, called noisy-context surprisal, based on rational inference over noisy memory representations. This model unifies surprisal and memory effects and derives dependency locality effects as a subset of information locality effects. I show that the new processing model also resolves a long-standing paradox in the psycholinguistic literature, structural forgetting, where the effects of memory appear to be language-dependent.

    "abstract": "Research in the domain of cognitive science has tended to neglect emotions. In my thesis, I take several steps to fill this gap by looking at people's representation of emotions, and its connection to other representations typically studied in cognitive science. I argue that people have an intuitive theory of emotion that is causally intertwined with their understanding of the physical and social world broadly. This intuitive theory allows us to use observed emotional cues as a window, to recover unobserved information about the world. I study these abilities in both adults and children, to gain insight into the most fundamental representations supporting such abilities. I also use computational models to capture the hierarchical, causal structure of this intuitive theory of emotion. In Study 1, I show that infants as young as 12-17 months can discriminate diverse within-valence emotional expressions elicited by funny, exciting, adorable, delicious, and sympathetic events, and map them onto their probable causes. In Study 2.1, I present that preschoolers can recover rich mental state information from observed emotional expressions. When the valence of someone's face changes between anticipated and actual outcomes, children by five gain insight into what she wants and believes about the world. Study 2.2 bridges theory of mind research, accounts of emotion attribution, and formal modeling, to provide a formal account of how people jointly infer beliefs and desires from emotional expressions. Study 3 tests children's understanding of social display rules. By middle childhood, children can use one person's emotional expressions regulated by a social context to infer the mental states of another. Altogether, these findings suggest that emotional cues provide a valuable entrée into the unseen world. Not only adults, but also children, can use observed emotional expressions to infer their external causes and the internal mental states of other people. Although this intuitive theory of emotion may not necessarily mirror the actual processes of how emotions are generated, it supports rational inferences much of time, and it may be formed early in development.

    "title": "A Bayesian framework for concept learning",
    "abstract": "Human concept learning presents a version of the classic problem of induction, which is made particularly difficult by the combination of two requirements: the need to learn from a rich (i.e. nested and overlapping) vocabulary of possible concepts and the need to be able to generalize concepts reasonably from only a few positive examples. I begin this thesis by considering a simple number concept game as a concrete illustration of this ability. On this task, human learners can with reasonable confidence lock in on one out of a billion billion billion logically possible concepts, after seeing only four positive examples of the concept, and can generalize informatively after seeing just a single example. Neither of the two classic approaches to inductive inference hypothesis testing in a constrained space of possible rules and computing similarity to the observed examples can provide a complete picture of how people generalize concepts in even this simple setting. This thesis proposes a new computational framework for understanding how people learn concepts from examples, based on the principles of Bayesian inference. By imposing the constraints of a probabilistic model of the learning situation, the Bayesian learner can draw out much more information about a concept's extension from a given set of observed examples than either rule-based or similarity-based approaches do, and can use this information in a rational way to infer the probability that any new object is also an instance of the concept. There are three components of the Bayesian framework: a prior probability distribution over a hypothesis space of possible concepts; a likelihood function, which scores each hypothesis according to its probability of generating the observed examples; and the principle of hypothesis averaging, under which the learner computes the probability of generalizing a concept to new objects by averaging the predictions of all hypotheses weighted by their posterior probability (proportional to the product of their priors and likelihoods). The likelihood, under the assumption of randomly sampled positive examples, embodies the size principle for scoring hypotheses: smaller consistent hypotheses are more likely than larger hypotheses, and they become exponentially more likely as the number of observed examples increases. The principle of hypothesis averaging allows the Bayesian framework to accommodate both rule-like and similarity-like generalization behavior, depending on how peaked the posterior probability is. Together, the size principle plus hypothesis averaging predict a convergence from similarity-like generalization (due to a broad posterior distribution) after very few examples are observed to rule-like generalization (due to a sharply peaked posterior distribution) after sufficiently many examples have been observed. The main contributions of this thesis are as follows. First and foremost, I show how it is possible for people to learn and generalize concepts from just one or a few positive examples (Chapter 2).  Building on that understanding, I then present a series of case studies of simple concept learning situations where the Bayesian framework yields both qualitative and quantitative insights into the real behavior of human learners (Chapters 3-5). These cases each focus on a different learning domain. Chapter 3 looks at generalization in continuous feature spaces, a typical representation of objects in psychology and machine learning with the virtues of being analytically tractable and empirically accessible, but the downside of being highly abstract and artificial. Chapter 4 moves to the more natural domain of learning words for categories of objects and shows the relevance of the same phenomena and explanatory principles introduced in the more abstract setting of Chapters 1-3 for real-world learning tasks like this one. In each of these domains, both similarity-like and rule-like generalization emerge as special cases of the Bayesian framework in the limits of very few or very many examples, respectively. However, the transition from similarity to rules occurs much faster in the word learning domain than in the continuous feature space domain. I propose a Bayesian explanation of this difference in learning curves that places crucial importance on the density or sparsity of overlapping hypotheses in the learner's hypothesis space. To test this proposal, a third case study (Chapter 5) returns to the domain of number concepts, in which human learners possess a more complex body of prior knowledge that leads to a hypothesis space with both sparse and densely overlapping components. Here, the Bayesian theory predicts and human learners produce either rule-based or similarity-based generalization from a few examples, depending on the precise examples observed. I also discusses how several classic reasoning heuristics may be used to approximate the much more elaborate computations of Bayesian inference that this domain requires. In each of these case studies, I confront some of the classic questions of concept learning and induction: Is the acquisition of concepts driven mainly by pre-existing knowledge or the statistical force of our observations? Is generalization based primarily on abstract rules or similarity to exemplars? I argue that in almost all instances, the only reasonable answer to such questions is, Both. More importantly, I show how the Bayesian framework allows us to answer much more penetrating versions of these questions: How does prior knowledge interact with the observed examples to guide generalization? Why does generalization appear rule-based in some cases and similarity-based in others? Finally, Chapter 6 summarizes the major contributions in more detailed form and discusses how this work ts into the larger picture of contemporary research on human learning, thinking, and reasoning.",

On this task, human learners can with reasonable confidence lock in on one out of a billion billion billion logically possible concepts, after seeing only four positive examples of the concept, and can generalize informatively after seeing just a single example. Neither of the two classic approaches to inductive inference hypothesis testing in a constrained space of possible rules and computing similarity to the observed examples can provide a complete picture of how people generalize concepts in even this simple setting. This thesis proposes a new computational framework for understanding how people learn concepts from examples, based on the principles of Bayesian inference. By imposing the constraints of a probabilistic model of the learning situation, the Bayesian learner can draw out much more information about a concept's extension from a given set of observed examples than either rule-based or similarity-based approaches do, and can use this information in a rational way to infer the probability that any new object is also an instance of the concept. There are three components of the Bayesian framework: a prior probability distribution over a hypothesis space of possible concepts; a likelihood function, which scores each hypothesis according to its probability of generating the observed examples; and the principle of hypothesis averaging, under which the learner computes the probability of generalizing a concept to new objects by averaging the predictions of all hypotheses weighted by their posterior probability (proportional to the product of their priors and likelihoods). The likelihood, under the assumption of randomly sampled positive examples, embodies the size principle for scoring hypotheses: smaller consistent hypotheses are more likely than larger hypotheses, and they become exponentially more likely as the number of observed examples increases. The principle of hypothesis averaging allows the Bayesian framework to accommodate both rule-like and similarity-like generalization behavior, depending on how peaked the posterior probability is. Together, the size principle plus hypothesis averaging predict a convergence from similarity-like generalization (due to a broad posterior distribution) after very few examples are observed to rule-like generalization (due to a sharply peaked posterior distribution) after sufficiently many examples have been observed. The main contributions of this thesis are as follows. First and foremost, I show how it is possible for people to learn and generalize concepts from just one or a few positive examples (Chapter 2).  Building on that understanding, I then present a series of case studies of simple concept learning situations where the Bayesian framework yields both qualitative and quantitative insights into the real behavior of human learners (Chapters 3-5). These cases each focus on a different learning domain. Chapter 3 looks at generalization in continuous feature spaces, a typical representation of objects in psychology and machine learning with the virtues of being analytically tractable and empirically accessible, but the downside of being highly abstract and artificial. Chapter 4 moves to the more natural domain of learning words for categories of objects and shows the relevance of the same phenomena and explanatory principles introduced in the more abstract setting of Chapters 1-3 for real-world learning tasks like this one. In each of these domains, both similarity-like and rule-like generalization emerge as special cases of the Bayesian framework in the limits of very few or very many examples, respectively. However, the transition from similarity to rules occurs much faster in the word learning domain than in the continuous feature space domain. I propose a Bayesian explanation of this difference in learning curves that places crucial importance on the density or sparsity of overlapping hypotheses in the learner's hypothesis space. To test this proposal, a third case study (Chapter 5) returns to the domain of number concepts, in which human learners possess a more complex body of prior knowledge that leads to a hypothesis space with both sparse and densely overlapping components. Here, the Bayesian theory predicts and human learners produce either rule-based or similarity-based generalization from a few examples, depending on the precise examples observed. I also discusses how several classic reasoning heuristics may be used to approximate the much more elaborate computations of Bayesian inference that this domain requires. In each of these case studies, I confront some of the classic questions of concept learning and induction: Is the acquisition of concepts driven mainly by pre-existing knowledge or the statistical force of our observations? Is generalization based primarily on abstract rules or similarity to exemplars? I argue that in almost all instances, the only reasonable answer to such questions is, Both. More importantly, I show how the Bayesian framework allows us to answer much more penetrating versions of these questions: How does prior knowledge interact with the observed examples to guide generalization? Why does generalization appear rule-based in some cases and similarity-based in others? Finally, Chapter 6 summarizes the major contributions in more detailed form and discusses how this work ts into the larger picture of contemporary research on human learning, thinking, and reasoning."

Going beyond the false dichotomy of same versus different processing, it is more important to understand how exactly faces are processed similarly or differently from objects.

Various aspects of face processing, such as holistic, configural, and face-space processing, are investigated in relative isolation, and the relationships between these are unclear. Furthermore, face processing is characteristically affected by various stimulus transformations such as inversion, contrast reversal and spatial frequency filtering, but how or why is unclear. Most importantly, we do not understand even the basic mechanisms of face processing. We hypothesize that what makes face processing distinctive is the existence of large, coarse face templates. We test our hypothesis by modifying an existing model of object processing to utilize such templates, and find that our model can account for many face-related phenomena. Using small, fine face templates as a control, we find that our model displays object-like processing characteristics instead. Overall, we believe that we may have made the first steps towards achieving a unified account of face processing.

We postulate that neurons and astrocytes are sensitive to biophysical conditions in their local environment, in addition to their participation in traditional signaling networks with other neurons. Mechanically sensitive astrocytic endfeet ensheathe cerebral blood vessels, which change size in order to regulate blood flow. We found that changes in local biophysical state caused by mechanical perturbations exerted through blood vessels can depolarize astrocytes and some neurons in slice. To test the hemoneural hypothesis in vivo, we developed a means of inducing dilation using the SUR2B receptor agonist pinacidil, which is specific to vascular smooth muscle. It was important to ascertain that pinacidil had no direct effect on astrocytes or neurons, and we confirmed this in whole cell recordings in cortical slices. We then used two-photon imaging to visualize astrocytic calcium dynamics in vivo while manipulating vasodilation in vivo. Pinacidil caused a 10-20% dilation in most vessels, a degree of dilation of similar magnitude to those naturally evoked by persistent sensory stimulation (e.g. in fMRI studies). We found that increases in pial arteriole diameter could occasionally evoke traveling calcium waves in astrocytes. We also saw consistently slow increases (which took tens of seconds to onset, and persisted for minutes) in astrocytic calcium levels at both endfeet and soma in cortical layer 1, corresponding to vessel dilation. When vessels partially reconstricted due to pinacidil washout, calcium levels also showed a relative decrease. At short time scales (from 0.5 - 5 seconds) we saw strong correlations (>0.5) between small fluctuations in astrocytic calcium levels (1-3%) and vessel diameter (1-3%).

Together, this data unites desperate observations of network-level deficits and identifies critical locations of early A[beta] deposition in the brain. By linking molecular and network observations, I begin to provide biological explanations for the clinical manifestation of AD.

Furthermore, young birds learn by imitating a tutor song, and it was previously unclear precisely how the experience of hearing a tutor might shape auditory, motor, and evaluation pathways in the songbird brain. My thesis presents a framework for how these pathways may assemble during early learning, using simple neural mechanisms. I start with a neural network model for how premotor sequences may grow and split. This model predicts that the sequence-generating nucleus HVC would receive rhythmically patterned training inputs. I found such a signal when I recorded neurons that project to HVC. When juvenile birds sing, these neurons burst at the beginning of each syllable, and when the birds listen to a tutor, neurons burst at the rhythm of the tutor's song. Bursts marking the beginning of every tutor syllable could seed chains of sequential activity in HVC that could be used to generate the bird's own song imitation. I next used functional calcium imaging to characterize HVC sequences before and after tutor exposure. Analysis of these datasets led us to develop a new method for unsupervised detection of neural sequences. Using this method, I was able to observe neural sequences even prior to tutor exposure. Some of these sequences could be tracked as new syllables emerged after tutor exposure, and some sequences appeared to become coupled to the new syllables.

    "title": "Activity-dependent integration and plasticity of new neurons during postnatal neurogenesis",
    "abstract": "Most neurons are born during the embryonic period to become the building blocks for a variety of brain circuits. However, two brain regions only start to assemble during the postnatal period. Both brain areas, olfactory bulb and dentate gyrus, mainly accommodate the integration of new neurons during the postnatal period, and continuously receive new neurons throughout animals' life. In this thesis, I used the rat olfactory bulb (OB) as a model system to address two important issues regarding the integration and plasticity of new neurons generated during the postnatal period. The first feature of postnatal neurogenesis is that when new neurons arrive and integrate into an adult OB, only half of neurons can ultimately survive. However, what form of activity pattern determines the survival of new neurons remains unclear. Using NaChBac sodium channels to selectively alter the intrinsic excitability of new neurons in vivo, this manipulation reveals that neuronal survival critically depends on the level of membrane depolarization. Once neurons integrate and survive in the brain circuits, neurons have the capability of monitoring their activity level and adaptively maintain their membrane excitability within the operational range. How they achieve the long-term stability of membrane excitability remains unclear. By altering the resting membrane potential of individual neurons in vivo, OB granule neurons are found to use a subthreshold parameter, resting membrane potential, to guide the compensatory changes of intrinsic ion channels and synaptic receptors. In summary, studies from this thesis have revealed the cellular mechanisms underlying neuronal survival in an in vivo brain circuit. I also uncover a novel form of homeostatic computation by which granule neurons preferentially use the subthreshold membrane potential response rather than spiking rates as a set point.",

    "abstract": "The neuronal serine/threonine kinase cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is activated by its regulatory subunit, p35, to post-translationally modify substrates through phosphorylation. In this thesis, I provide several lines of evidence that Cdk5 plays a critical role in synaptic function and plasticity. First, we characterized the function of Cdk5 in learning and memory by region-specific Cdk5 ablation. From multiple Cdk5 conditional knockout mouse models, we determined that Cdk5 is essential for memory formation and synaptic plasticity. Loss of Cdk5 in the hippocampus disrupts the cAMP pathway due to increased phosphodiesterase proteins. This dysregulation of cAMP signaling can be attenuated by a phosphodiesterase inhibitor to restore levels of protein phosphorylation, synaptic plasticity, and memory. Moreover, forebrain-specific deletion of Cdk5 affected multiple aspects of behavior that can partially be rescued by lithium treatment. We next identified the N-type calcium channels as a presynaptic substrate of Cdk5. We described how Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of the N-type calcium channel increased calcium influx and channel open probability. This in turn enhanced the association of the N-type calcium channel with the active zone protein RIM1, which impacted vesicle docking and neurotransmission. Finally, we identified the postsynaptic density protein Shank3 as a Cdk5 substrate and observed that Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of Shank3 plays a critical role in maintaining dendritic spine morphology and synaptic plasticity. Our collective results demonstrate a central role for Cdk5 in regulating both presynaptic and postsynaptic functions and provide better insight into how specific targets of Cdk5 can impact a general mechanism underlying synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive function.",

    "abstract": "The field of neuroscience has the potential to address profound questions including explaining how neural activity enables complex behaviors and conscious experience. However, currently the field is a long way from understanding these issues, and progress has been slow. One of the main problems holding back the pace of discovery is that it is still unclear how to interpret neural activity once it has been recorded. This lack of understanding has led to many different data analysis methods, which makes it difficult to evaluate the validity and importance of many reported results. If a clearer understanding of how to interpret neural data existed, it should be much easier to answer other questions about how the brain functions. In this thesis I describe how to use a data analysis method called 'neural population decoding' to analyze data in a way that is potentially more relevant for understanding neural information processing. By applying this method in novel ways to data from several vision experiments, I am able to make several new discoveries, including the fact that abstract category information is coded in the inferior temporal cortex (ITC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) by dynamic patterns of neural activity, and that when a monkey attends to an object in a cluttered display, the pattern of ITC activity returns to a state that is similar to when the attended object is presented alone. These findings are not only interesting for insights that they give into the content and coding of information in high level visual areas, but they also demonstrate the benefits of using neural population decoding to analyze data.

Some geologists interpret escarpments as stationary features, whereas others have argued that they are retreating inland faster than a kilometer per Myr. I investigate Brazilian escarpments by determining whether or not the river networks on either side of the escarpment are in erosional equilibrium with each other. My approach is based on the premise that rivers on opposite sides of a stationary escarpment would be eroding at the same rate (erosional equilibrium), whereas rivers on opposite sides of a mobile escarpment would be eroding at different rates (erosional disequilibrium). I use a recently developed technique called chi mapping to assess the erosional disequilibrium of river networks along the Brazilian escarpments. For comparison, I also compile erosion rates on either side of the escarpments from cosmogenic \"Be measurements in the existing literature, and use these to calculate recent retreat rates of the escarpments, which fall between 4 and 40 m/Myr. I determine that chi mapping and cosmogenic erosion rates agree on the direction of escarpment movement, but disagree on the magnitudes of the retreat rates. I also estimate the percentage of drainage area exchanged by stream capture as the escarpment drainage divide moves across the landscape. Using two different estimation methods, I find that less than 40% of drainage area is exchanged by stream capture, making divide migration the dominant mechanism for drainage basin reorganization. If my estimates of recent escarpment retreat rates are representative of long-term rates, the Brazilian escarpments have retreated up to 5 km since their formation during the Cretaceous rifting event. My analysis shows that the topographic retreat of the Brazilian escarpments could have been driven by drainage basin disequilibrium resulting in divide migration.",

    "abstract": "The possibility of an asteroid or comet impact necessitates the tracking and cataloging of all such objects which could potentially impact Earth. Currently, no comprehensive catalog of Near Earth Objects (NEOs) exists which contains information on the physical properties of the objects. Spectroscopic observation of NEOs must be carried out in an efficient and timely manner in order to determine the physical properties of NEOs for this catalog. The cumulative fractions of objects visible at certain magnitudes were examined and compared for the NEOs discovered in 2005 at discovery, those at the first quarter moon following discovery, and all known NEOs in 1, 3, 5, and 10 year forecasted surveys to determine the best combination of Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) instrumentation, telescope observation time, and survey length. This thesis finds that the IRTF instrumentation should be improved to at least 19.5 to spectroscopically observe 57% of the objects discovered in 2005. Furthermore, spectroscopic observation of the objects should not occur at the first quarter moon immediately after discovery, as is currently the case, because as much as ~15% of the objects discovered in 2005 cannot be observed at this time. As survey length is increased, the fraction of objects that can be observed at the IRTF's current limiting magnitude also increase; thus it is best to conduct the survey as long as possible. Additionally, spectroscopic observation of the objects should be carried out every 7 days in order to gather the most information. Lastly, it is best to spectroscopically observe the objects within 7 days of discovery because the objects are generally discovered when they are at their closest possible approach to the Earth.",

In this preliminary study of Obsidian Pool, I used a modified Bligh and Dyer extraction process to create a total lipid extract (TLE), which was then further separated and processed by an acetone precipitation, mild alkaline methanolysis and column chromatography to isolate different fractions of the TLE. Compounds were then identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS). The mild alkaline methanolysis allowed for the identification of decanoic acid methyl ester, a fatty acid methyl ester. From the column chromatography, only the saturated hydrocarbon fraction yielded interesting compounds; these were a series of n-alkanes (n-C₁₇, n-C₂₀, and n-C₂₃ - n-C₃₁), two branched alkanes (5-methyloctodecane and 4-methylheptadecane), an isoprenoid (dibiphytane), a series of branched aliphatic alkanes with a quaternary substituted carbon atom (5,5 diethylalkanes), and a variety of hopanoids and steroids.

    "abstract": "Introduction: Centaurs are small bodies whose orbits lie between those of Jupiter and Neptune (Gehrels, 1999). They are thought to be transition objects that originate in the Kuiper belt and occupy the cis-Neptunian region before potentially becoming Jupiter-family or other short-period comets (Dones, Levison, & Duncan, 1996). Their short dynamical lifetimes are on the order of 106 years (Horner, Evans, & Bailey, 2004) due to their unstable, planet-crossing orbits (Horner, Evans, Bailey, & Asher, 2003). Some Centaurs have been observed to be active, and the bodies in the population of active Centaurs have perihelion distances that are statistically smaller than the median perihelion distance for all Centaurs, suggesting that Centaur activity is thermal in nature (Jewitt, 2009). Centaur activity may be observed through changes in the brightness of an object such as those exhibited by the Centaur Chiron (Parker et al., 1997). The presence of a coma around a Centaur may also provide evidence of activity, and dust comae have been detected around several bodies including Chiron (Meech & Belton, 1989; Luu & Jewitt, 1990) and Echeclus (Choi, Weissman, & Polishook, 2006). In addition to comae, other structures have been observed around Centaurs, such as the ring system that was discovered around Chariklo during a stellar occultation (Braga-Ribas et al., 2014). A symmetric feature was observed around Chiron during an occultation (Ruprecht et al., 2015), and some interpret this feature to be possible ring material (Ortiz et al., 2015). Similarly, the trans-Neptunian dwarf planet Haumea was revealed to have a ring during a stellar occultation (Ortiz et al., 2017). The collisional spreading time of Chariklo's rings was calculated to be on the order of 101 years, which is short in comparison to the estimated Centaur lifetime of approximately 106 years (Pan & Wu, 2016), yet Centaur rings are still observed despite this contradiction. Shepherd satellites may serve to increase the lifetime of a Centaur's rings (Pan & Wu, 2016) and maintain distinct ring edges such as those observed in Chariklo's ring system (Charnoz, Canup, Crida, Dones, 2017). Moreover, Centaur activity could supply material to an already present ring system, thus prolonging its lifetime. This study explores the potential connection between Centaur activity and Centaur ring systems by using the N-body integrator REBOUND to model outburst particle interactions and distributions.",

This division is important because bedload has a dominant control on channel morphology while suspended load dominates the formation of overbank deposits.

However direct application of this method in natural, sandy rivers is difficult due to large variabilities in flow. We propose a method for determining local flow conditions using the distribution of grain sizes traveling in the water column. Local shear velocity is found by fitting the Rouse equation for suspended sediment transport to measured sediment concentrations. Empirical criteria for distinguishing between suspended load and bedload are used to determine the fraction of sediment traveling in each respective mode. Application of this method to the Niobrara River, Nebraska, shows that -80 % of the sediment is traveling as suspended load, ~ 20 % is traveling in a transitional mode between bedload and suspended load and less than 1 % is traveling as pure bedload.

    "abstract": "The early Cenozoic India-Asia collision resulted in the extrusion of large crustal fragments southeast from the Eastern Himalayan syntaxis, with large shear zones at their boundaries that could have accommodated displacements of hundreds to perhaps a thousand kilometers. Along the northeastern edge of the Indochina extruded fragment, the belt of mylonitic metamorphic rocks generally referred to as the Ailao Shan/Red River shear zone forms the extrusion boundary. This shear zone actually consists of at least two belts, the Ailao Shan and the Day Nui Con Voi, which are separated by a narrow belt of unmetamorphosed Triassic sedimentary rocks. In the Chinese extension of the Day Nui Con Voi, the presence of sillimanite and garnet indicates the shear zone formed at amphibolite grade, and the mylonitic fabric defined by muscovite and biotite indicate left-lateral shearing. Ar/Ar cooling ages indicate the metamorphic rocks reached the cooling temperature of muscovite and biotite 26.07 ± 0.20 to 32.46 ± 0.25 Ma, ages that match those in the Day Nui Con Voi in north Vietnam.

    "text": "The Day Nui Con Voi mylonitic belt in Southwestern China and Its implications for the early Cenozoic extrusion of Indochina The early Cenozoic India-Asia collision resulted in the extrusion of large crustal fragments southeast from the Eastern Himalayan syntaxis, with large shear zones at their boundaries that could have accommodated displacements of hundreds to perhaps a thousand kilometers. Along the northeastern edge of the Indochina extruded fragment, the belt of mylonitic metamorphic rocks generally referred to as the Ailao Shan/Red River shear zone forms the extrusion boundary. This shear zone actually consists of at least two belts, the Ailao Shan and the Day Nui Con Voi, which are separated by a narrow belt of unmetamorphosed Triassic sedimentary rocks. In the Chinese extension of the Day Nui Con Voi, the presence of sillimanite and garnet indicates the shear zone formed at amphibolite grade, and the mylonitic fabric defined by muscovite and biotite indicate left-lateral shearing. Ar/Ar cooling ages indicate the metamorphic rocks reached the cooling temperature of muscovite and biotite 26.07 ± 0.20 to 32.46 ± 0.25 Ma, ages that match those in the Day Nui Con Voi in north Vietnam. These data come from both the core orthogneiss of the shear zone as well as a narrow carapace of metasedimentary rocks of unknown age.

The lead isotope ratios were compared with published data from aerosols and volcanic rocks nearest to the cocoa growing regions. Samples from different countries and manufacturers were compared, and we conclude that the source of lead depends on the country of origin and not the manufacturer. Chocolates grown in the Northern Hemisphere usually had lead isotope ratios that matched the global atmospheric lead isotopic signature from the Northern Hemisphere. Chocolates grown in the Southern Hemisphere did not match the global signature, but rather more closely matched the lead isotopic signature from volcanic rocks in their respective countries, and had a lower average lead concentration than chocolates from the Northern Hemisphere. Soils from Venezuela were also analyzed, and confirmed the conclusion that atmospheric lead is the predominant source of bioavailable lead. Many of the chocolates also had lead concentrations below the limit of 0.1 ppm set by the FDA; however, one manufacturer, Dagoba, consistently had lead concentrations above the limit.

In contrast to previous work, we allow the minimum mass of star-forming galaxies to vary between 10⁶Mo and 10⁷Mo, and we calculate the galactic number density separately for three subtypes of spiral galaxies.

The possible significance of temperature, humidity, nitrogen oxides, reactive chlorine, lightning frequency, surface deposition and albedo as altered constraints on ozone processes is discussed. An elementary box model is developed by the author to make first order judgments regarding the significance of chemistry changes on ozone concentrations and its climactic effect. A one dimensional photochemical-transport model (Kasting, 1995) was used to more precisely determine the effects of global glaciations on ozone concentrations up to 5 hPa in several latitude bands. Reduced NO₂ availability in the stratosphere seems to dominate ozone's response (positive anomalies) in the stratosphere. Low temperatures, low humidity, reduced lighting frequency and altered chlorine and nitrogen chemistry collectively reduce ozone presence in the troposphere, however the overall sign of the tropospheric ozone anomaly depends heavily on poorly characterized deposition rates. With output from the one-dimensional photochemistry model, a time-varying ozone concentration field was assembled for the entire planet and used in snowball runs of the General Circulation Model (NCAR Community Atmosphere Model 3.0). These runs were compared to a controlled snowball run with a modern ozone field to discern the climactic significance of altered ozone. Results suggest that ozone concentrations during global glaciations might directly produce global average surface radiation anomalies of -1.5 ~ 1.5 W/m² , resulting in global average surface temperature anomalies of -0.5 ~ 0.5°K. Magnitude and sign uncertainties result from poorly known deposition rates for ozone over frozen surfaces and the simplicity of the modeling technique.

    "abstract": "The REgolith X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (REXIS), a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD)-based coded aperture soft X-ray (0.3-7.5 keV) telescope for remote geochemical X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry, will be flying on board the Origins Spectral Interpretations Resource Identification Security Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) asteroid sample return mission that will be visiting the asteroid 1999 RQ36 and sending a sample back to Earth. REXIS will detect elemental XRF lines and produce a histogram of results as the spacecraft orbits the asteroid as well as produce a global map of elemental abundance ratios. The accuracy requirement for measuring the global ratios of elements and the spectral resolution requirement for discriminating unique XRF lines from each other have been set in place. The correct interpretation of X-ray measurements from the surface of 1999 RQ36 is limited by properties that are intrinsic to the CCD detector, CCID-41, that has been chosen for REXIS. This thesis study outlines student experimentation and results that were conducted on the CCID-41 detector to gauge the intrinsic detector noise as a function of detector temperature. Further, the widening of spectral lines on the resultant histogram was also equated as a function of detector temperature.

    "text": "Sizing the X-ray spectral resolution limits of the REgolith X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (REXIS) instrument at Asteroid 1999RQ36 The REgolith X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (REXIS), a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD)-based coded aperture soft X-ray (0.3-7.5 keV) telescope for remote geochemical X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry, will be flying on board the Origins Spectral Interpretations Resource Identification Security Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) asteroid sample return mission that will be visiting the asteroid 1999 RQ36 and sending a sample back to Earth. REXIS will detect elemental XRF lines and produce a histogram of results as the spacecraft orbits the asteroid as well as produce a global map of elemental abundance ratios. The accuracy requirement for measuring the global ratios of elements and the spectral resolution requirement for discriminating unique XRF lines from each other have been set in place. The correct interpretation of X-ray measurements from the surface of 1999 RQ36 is limited by properties that are intrinsic to the CCD detector, CCID-41, that has been chosen for REXIS. This thesis study outlines student experimentation and results that were conducted on the CCID-41 detector to gauge the intrinsic detector noise as a function of detector temperature. Further, the widening of spectral lines on the resultant histogram was also equated as a function of detector temperature. Members of the REXIS Team built a spectral resolution model to investigate both the widening of spectral lines as a function of detector temperature and the accuracy of the measurement of elemental abundance line ratios as a function of detector temperature.

Our studies show that the primary ferromagnetic mineral in SAH 99555 is magnetite and there are also some accessory ferromagnetic minerals including titanomagnetite and hematite. The natural remanent magnetization (NRM) of SAH 99555 appears to have a low-coercivity component probably from a collector's hand magnet or the Earth's field as well as a high-coercivity component, similar to D'Orbigny, another angrite.

Additionally, the study of the yearly TRI data from 2000 to 2014 showed that while average emissions per facility have been declining since 2000, particularly in the manufacturing sector, there is a surprising degree of variability in yearly totals than expected, exposing a potential topic of future research."

    "abstract": "The Avalon terrane in Newfoundland includes the Ediacaran Gaskiers Formation, which has been associated with a Snowball glaciation event. The complicated regional stratigraphy and lack of precise geochronological constraints has made it difficult to determine the spatial and temporal extent of the Gaskiers glaciation. Recent recognition of a diamictite facies on the nearby Bonavista Peninsula correlative with the Gaskiers diamictite has allowed for new, high-precision geochronological constraints on the Gaskiers glaciation and constrains the duration of the event to less than 390 ±320 kyr. The Snowball Earth hypothesis requires that glaciation continued for several millions of years so that CO2 could build up to high enough levels in the atmosphere for catastrophic deglaciation; the short duration of the Gaskiers event makes it unlikely to have been a Snowball event. Further geochronological studies are needed to determine whether the Gaskiers glaciation was a discrete event or if it was a glacial maximum in a longer Ediacaran ice age.",

This mineral signal must therefore be examined and controlled for. In this work, ICP-MS (inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry) analysis of trace element (strontium and magnesium) incorporation into calcium carbonate provides additional evidence for a shift in CaCO3 polymorphs identified via XRD (xray diffraction) analysis of speleothem AB-2 from Anjohibe Cave, Madgascar. The ICP-MS Sr/Ca data qualitatively supports the Sr/Ca data collected by the XRF core scanner, exhibiting a sharp decrease in value across the identified mineral transition. A corresponding increase in Mg/Ca revealed by the ICP-MS provides further evidence for a change from aragonite to calcite at this location. This mineralogical change occurred between 870-880 CE (+/- 13 years) is nearly concurrent with a shift in [delta]13C isotopes that was identified in previous work on this speleothem and attributed to an ecological shift in dominant photosynthetic pathways (Bums et al 2016). A second, control section was identified as pure calcite by XRD analysis, but revealed Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios characteristic of mineralogical transitions, suggesting that there may have been layers of aragonite that have recrystallized to calcite since deposition.",

However, if organic material accumulates in soils faster than it is converted to CO2 by cellular respiration, soil becomes a smaller GHG source and even has the potential to become a GHG sink. Not much is known about factors that drive soil to be a source or a sink of GHG. Soil temperature and moisture have both been shown to correlate with CH4 emissions and temperature has been shown to correlate with CO 2 emissions (Jacinthe et al., 2015). Currently these relationships are not well constrained, particularly in upland soils, which are soils found at elevations between 100 and 500 m (Carating et al., 2014). Soil from the Harvard Forest was collected and used in two in-lab flux experiments to constrain the effect that soil moisture has on i.) the rate of CH4 and CO2 production/consumption and ii.) the fraction of injected CH4 that is oxidized to CO2 by soil microbes. The first experiment involved injecting vials containing soil samples with CH4 , taking an initial measurement with a residual gas analyzer (RGA), incubating for three days, and taking final measurements using the RGA. The results of this experiment indicated that cellular respiration is an important carbon source in these soils, with more CO2 coming from cellular respiration than from the oxidation of CH4. The second experiment involved injecting vials containing soil samples with CH4 and 14CH4 as a tracer, incubating for six days, and analyzing CO2 from each sample using a scintillation counter. This experiment showed a weak trend indicating that increased soil moisture may result in decreased CH4 oxidation. Results showed that decays per minute from the samples were lower than in a control. These results indicated that not all CO 2 from each sample was successfully captured and analyzed using the methods here. So while the trend may hold true, it should be supported by reconducting the experiment using a more reliable means of CO2 capture.

    "text": "Records of Great Basin precipitation during MIS 11 from two Lehman Cave stalagmites Trace elements (Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca) and stable isotopes ([delta]13C and [delta]18O) were measured in two coeval stalagmites, LC3 and BT1, from the Lehman Caves, Nevada. BT1 spans 388 to 384 ka. The LC3 record is split into two parts due to a hiatus observed through fluorescent imaging. The section prior to the hiatus spans 411 ka to 402 ka. The post-hiatus section of the stalagmite has a single age of 383 ka; an age model cannot be constructed for this part of the record. These stalagmites span Marine Isotope Stage 11 (MIS 11), a long interglacial that occurred around 424-374 ka. Comparison with more recent stalagmite records has shown prior calcite precipitation to be the dominant control on Mg/Ca and [delta]13C in the cave. The trace element and stable isotope records obtained point to an arid climate in the Great Basin during MIS 11."

    "abstract": "A recent article by Kidston et al. [8] demonstrates that the length of atmospheric eddies increases in simulations of future global warming. This thesis expands on Kidston et al.'s work with additional studies of eddy length in the NCEP2 reanalysis (a model-data synthesis that reconstructs past atmospheric circulation) and general circulation models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3. Eddy lengths are compared to computed values of the Rossby radius and the Rhines scale, which have been hypothesized to set the eddy length. The GCMs reproduce the seasonal variation in the eddy lengths seen in the reanalysis. To explore the effect of latent heating on the eddies, a modification to the static stability is used to calculate an effective Rossby radius. The effective Rossby radius is an improvement over the traditional dry Rossby radius in predicting the seasonal cycle of northern hemisphere eddy length, if the height scale used for calculation of the Rossby radius is the depth of the free troposphere. There is no improvement if the scale height is used instead of the free troposphere depth. However, both Rossby radii and the Rhines scale fail to explain the weaker seasonal cycle in southern hemisphere eddy length. In agreement with Kidson et al., the GCMs robustly project an increase in eddy length as the climate warms. The Rossby radii and Rhines scale are also generally projected to increase.

    "title": "Understanding the spatial distribution of the Southern Hemisphere near-surface westerlies and Its trends",
    "abstract": "In some experiments in which idealized general circulation models (GCMS) are used to study the tropospheric response to stratospheric perturbations, the tropospheric response is much stronger and longer-lived compared to observations (e.g., Polvani and Kushner 2002, Kushner and Polvani 2004). Chan and Plumb (2009) found that those experiments which exhibited particularly long tropospheric decorrelation times (and, by the fluctuation dissipation theorem, much stronger annular mode responses) were marked by bimodality in the distribution of the latitude of surface zonal-mean zonal winds. Here, ERA-Interim and NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data are used to establish if this bimodality exists in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) near-surface winds, which would predict the existence of an additional mode of tropospheric variability exhibiting stronger and longer-lived responses than what has previously been observed. Histograms of the latitudinal position of maximum near-surface zonal-mean zonal winds turn up no convincing evidence of jet bimodality, although they do reveal an interesting - but probably spurious trimodality in the NCEP/NCAR June-August 850-hPa distribution of jet latitude. A climatology of wintertime zonal winds reveals that there is a time-mean split jet over the South Pacific Ocean; furthermore, empirical orthogonal function analysis reveals that, over the South Pacific, the dominant mode of wintertime zonal wind variability is a splitting and un splitting of the jet. Ultimately, both the climatological split jet and its variability are determined not to be evidence of jet bimodality. The temporal trends in the distribution of near-surface jet latitude are also examined. Stratospheric ozone depletion has been implicated in surface circulation changes in the SH high latitudes; one of these changes has been a poleward shift of the jet in austral summer. In this thesis, it is found that a poleward shift of the December-February distribution of jet latitude has taken place from the pre-ozone-hole to ozone-hole eras, consistent with previous findings. The novel result is that there has also been a poleward shift of this distribution in May, which is consistent with a secondary maximum in ozone depletion near the tropopause in April-May as observed by other authors (Thompson et al. 2011), and would imply the occurrence of troposphere-stratosphere coupling in late fall.

As an example, because the absolute linear scale of (22) Kalliope/Linus is known [1], one can determine the component sizes and reduce error bars on the mass and density of this M-type asteroid. Since the bulk composition is known from spectral data, the porosity of the asteroid can be calculated. Knowing the porosity of the asteroid can give scientists a better understanding of its formation and dynamical evolution. Binary object (22) Kalliope/Linus is a classic example of a system for which this technique can yield valuable results. An observing campaign involving five observers resulted in twenty-eight nights of data. The data were used to create rotational lightcurves, which were scanned for signatures of mutual events."

    "abstract": "Hillslopes evolve in response to base level change, sediment production, and sediment transport. Many previous studies have focused on hillslopes undergoing vertical base level migration due to tectonic forcing and bedrock incision. Many geomorphic features, however, are characterized by lateral hillslope retreat and have not been adequately studied. Here I adapt a theory of linear diffusive hillslope evolution to relate the velocity of lateral hillslope retreat to the steady-state hillslope form. A case study in a Florida sapping network, in which headward migration of seepage faces in a sandy soil sets the base level for the surrounding hillslopes, provides numerous opportunities to test the analytical model by direct measurement. Measurements of hillslopes in the Florida sapping network found quantitative agreement between the predicted and observed hillslope morphology. An expected relationship between geometric drainage area and channel growth velocity was not borne out in the data, but the distribution of measured v/K ratios is consistent with what I expect based on my preferential sampling of slow-moving gently-sloped heads. Several explanations are given to explain why the expected relationship with drainage area is not observed, and suggestions for future work based on these findings is offered.",

    "abstract": "Tropical cyclones (TCs) are among the most expensive and lethal geophysical hazards. Studies suggest that the intensity of TCs will increase due to the thermodynamic effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gas input. In contrast, while aerosols are shown to have an overall cooling effect on global climate, their impact on TCs is not yet well-understood. This paper explores the influence of the sulfate aerosol first indirect effect (AIE) on Atlantic hurricane intensity and genesis. I use a single-column radiative convective model that incorporates the first AIE (aerosol enhancement of cloud reflectivity) through parameterization of cloud droplet number, radius, and optical depth. Cloud droplet number is parameterized using an empirical scheme, while the radius is determined from cloud liquid water content and number concentration moments, and the optical depth scheme is embedded in the original single-column model. The model is run with both the IGAC/SPARC Chemistry Climate Model Initiative (CCMI) historical simulations of sulfate concentrations over the hurricane main development region during hurricane peak season (August-October) and a self-generated inventory of sulfate concentrations based on realistic vertical variability in sulfate levels. The model was run to radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE), then rerun under weak temperature gradient mode (WTG). Runs successfully produce the Twomey or first indirect effect, which states that increased aerosols will increase cloud droplet number concentration, decrease the effective cloud droplet radius, and increase the cloud optical depth. The net effect is increased reflection of radiation from the atmosphere, which theoretically cools the Earth, decreasing the potential intensity and genesis potential of TCs. While model runs produce the expected changes in cloud properties, cloud cover is not sufficient for sulfate concentrations to have a substantial impact on hurricane activity via the AIE when the model is run to RCE. The WTG mode is then implemented with the goal of producing low-lying stratocumulus clouds to increase total cloud cover, but the single-column WTG scheme was not able to produce stratocumulus that did not also produce an overly strong negative feedback. Using the single-column model, one can demonstrate the indirect effect of sulfate aerosols on cloud reflectivity and that sufficient cloud cover is needed to produce a noticeable cooling and change in expected hurricane behavior. A further study of the subject could include parameterization of the poorly-understood cold or mixed-phase clouds, which can include characterization of additional aerosol types. In addition, a two-dimensional model has greater capacity to model phenomena such as low-lying stratocumulus, which could produce a more substantial ambient effect.",

Gabbros and layered gabbro mylonites were collected from the Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR), ODP Hole 735B. Deformation temperatures are constrained by two-pyroxene thermometry, stress is estimated from grain size, and deformation mechanisms are analyzed by microstructure and the presence or absence of a lattice preferred orientation (LPO). Our analyses indicate that mylonite layers deformed at a strain rate in the range of 1012 to 101 s-1, while coarse-grained gabbro deformed at a strain rate of approximately 10-14 to 1013 s-1. Plagioclase in pure plagioclase mylonite layers exhibit strong LPOs indicating they deform by dislocation creep. Plagioclase grain size in mixed plagioclase-pyroxene mylonite layers is finer than in pure plagioclase layers, and depends on the size and proportion of pyroxenes. Progressive mixing of pyroxene and plagioclase within gabbro mylonite layers is accompanied by weakening of the LPO indicating that phase mixing promotes a transition to diffusion creep processes that involve grain boundary sliding. Our results indicate that experimental flow laws are accurate at geologic strain rates, although the strain rate for diffusion creep of fine-grained gabbro may be underestimated. At the conditions estimated for the SWIR crust, our calculations suggest that strain localization leads to a factor of two to four decrease in lower crustal viscosity.

    "abstract": "The Beni Bousera ultramafic massif is a tectonically emplaced body of upper mantle material that is exposed over 72 km2 in the Betic-Rif-Tell orogenic belt of northern Morocco. The massif is composed primarily of spinel lherzolite, although meter-scale domains of harzburgite, dunite, and veins and layers of pyroxenite are relatively common. A combined field and laboratory-based investigation of Beni Bousera has yielded a new dataset comprised of whole rock and mineral chemistry data that is used to suggest the massif is more heterogeneous than previously interpreted, and that \"secondary\" peridotites and dunites were formed by different petrogenic processes than the remainder of the massif. Trends in the CaO-MgO-Al 203-SiO 2 system and trace element patterns suggest partial melting of the peridotite played a significant role in the evolution of the massif, as has been previously suggested for other orogenic peridotites. Heterogeneous zones - regions throughout the massif with diverse groups of peridotites and pyroxenites - are believed to be relict melt transport channels. Peridotites and pyroxenites found in these zones show evidence of interaction with a relatively depleted melt (high Cr, low Al and Ti in mineral phases), and textures that suggest the secondary precipitation of neoblastic pyroxenes along matrix olivine grain boundaries. Rare earth element concentrations of clinopyroxene from two peridotite groups suggest equilibration in the garnet stability field, and temperatures calculated from dysprosium concentrations are usually higher than those determined from two-pyroxene thermometry. Linear major element patterns versus MgO and whole rock REE compositions of Beni Bousera dunites suggest that they cannot have formed via partial melting alone. The data collected here also suggest that the massif has experienced several mantle P/T conditions, and continuously equilibrated during exhumation and emplacement into the crust. A comparison with the geometry of the melt transport domain at Ronda, another Mediterranean peridotite body, suggests that although Beni Bousera and Ronda may be related in age of exhumation, melt may have been transported via different pathways in the two massifs.",

Trends in the CaO-MgO-Al 203-SiO 2 system and trace element patterns suggest partial melting of the peridotite played a significant role in the evolution of the massif, as has been previously suggested for other orogenic peridotites. Heterogeneous zones - regions throughout the massif with diverse groups of peridotites and pyroxenites - are believed to be relict melt transport channels. Peridotites and pyroxenites found in these zones show evidence of interaction with a relatively depleted melt (high Cr, low Al and Ti in mineral phases), and textures that suggest the secondary precipitation of neoblastic pyroxenes along matrix olivine grain boundaries. Rare earth element concentrations of clinopyroxene from two peridotite groups suggest equilibration in the garnet stability field, and temperatures calculated from dysprosium concentrations are usually higher than those determined from two-pyroxene thermometry. Linear major element patterns versus MgO and whole rock REE compositions of Beni Bousera dunites suggest that they cannot have formed via partial melting alone. The data collected here also suggest that the massif has experienced several mantle P/T conditions, and continuously equilibrated during exhumation and emplacement into the crust. A comparison with the geometry of the melt transport domain at Ronda, another Mediterranean peridotite body, suggests that although Beni Bousera and Ronda may be related in age of exhumation, melt may have been transported via different pathways in the two massifs."

    "abstract": "Ice clouds scatter and absorb solar radiation, affecting atmospheric and surface temperatures (Gettelman et al., 2012). On Mars, where ice contained in clouds makes up a large portion of total atmospheric water vapor, ice clouds also alter the planetary water budget (Maltagliati et al., 2011; Rafkin et al., 2013). Thus, it is important for climate models to be able to accurately predict the conditions under which ice clouds can form. Typical Martian temperatures at cloud-formation height range from -150-200 K (Trainer, Toon, & Tolbert, 2009). Heterogeneous deposition nucleation is thought to be the dominant freezing mechanism on Mars due to the abundance of mineral dust to serve as ice nuclei (IN) (Mdittanen et al., 2005). The parameters for such nucleation are not well characterized at such low temperatures (Trainer et al., 2009). Previous experimental studies have investigated the relative humidity required for deposition nucleation within the Martian temperature range. However, most studies took place on bulk aerosol samples, did not use mineral dusts analogous to Martian dust, or were constrained by particle lifetime and temperature limits. In this project, we re-purpose a single-particle instrument and set it up to perform experiments for more precise ice nucleation data under Martian atmospheric conditions. We use an electrodynamic balance (EDB) to levitate individual particles with diameters around 10 pm. We calculate the size of the particle and changes in size based on the holding voltages. The system can be cooled to 200 K in its current configuration, and the relative humidity and atmospheric constituents can be controlled by adding gas. To test the EDB, we perform validation experiments. We investigate deliquescence and efflorescence on salts at room temperature and 0 'C. We modify the cooling system, thermocouples, and relative humidity sensors and begin freezing experiments with Arizona Test Dust (ATD) and with Mojave Mars Simulant (MMS) dust. We investigate water uptake on MMS particles and find it to be non-hygroscopic but wettable, uptaking monolayers of water between 65-95% relative humidity. From 200 K to 220 K, MMS does not nucleate up to 115% RHice, suggesting that higher supersaturations are needed for ice clouds to form; some Martian cloud modelers should revisit the critical supersaturation parameterization. Future work will improve the EDB and use it to examine phase functions and light scattering.",

This raises the question of how interaction among multiple fractures affects surface deformation. Finite element modeling is used to build a 3D model of a reservoir with multiple fractures. The interacting cracks and fractures give this model a more complicated stress state, and so any surface deformation would be different from that of a model with a single fracture. Geodetic monitoring of large-scale CO 2 sequestration provides a potentially powerful and cost-effective tool for interrogating reservoir structure and processes. For example, InSAR observations at the InSalah, Algeria sequestration site have mapped the surface deformation above an active reservoir, and helped delineate the effects of CO2 storage. The impact of interactions on individual fractures and the qualitative changes in the surface displacement and stress fields are considered and the importance of orientation, position and fracture area is investigated. It was found that when the crack locations are biased towards stacked parallel arrangements, then the shielding effect of interactions dominates, meaning that the overall stiffness of a representative volume increases. When collinear interactions dominate then the overall stiffness is reduced.

    "abstract": "Other than Earth, Mars and Titan are the only bodies in our Solar System where we have observed widespread fluvial activity. In this thesis I present two approaches for constraining the extent of multiple resurfacing processes in order to gain insight into the early history of Mars and Titan. One of the most distinctive features of the Martian surface is the dichotomy between the heavily cratered southern highlands and the relatively smooth northern lowlands. The northern lowlands appear smooth because many of the craters in the north have been partially or completely buried beneath volcanic and sedimentary fill of unknown relative proportions. In Chapter 1, we use the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) topography data, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) gravity model and a Wiener filter to map these buried craters and estimate minimum fill thickness and volume as well as maximum fill density. The overall trend observed for the northern lowlands is more sedimentation near the dichotomy and less sedimentation further north and near the Tharsis region, which is consistent with the geology of the region. Titan has few impact craters, suggesting that its surface is geologically young. In Chapter 2 we evaluate whether fluvial erosion has caused significant resurfacing by estimating the cumulative erosion around the margins of polar lakes. Images of drowned fluvial features around the lake margins, where elevated levels of hydrocarbon liquids appear to have partly flooded fluvial valleys, allow us to map topographic contours that trace the fluvially dissected topography. We then used a numerical landscape evolution model to calibrate a relationship between contour sinuosity, which reflects the extent of fluvial valley incision, and cumulative erosion. We find that cumulative fluvial erosion around the margins of Titan's polar lakes, including Ligeia Mare, Kraken Mare, and Punga Mare in the north and Ontario Lacus in the south, ranges from 4% to 31% of the initial relief. Additional model simulations show that this amount of fluvial erosion does not render craters invisible at the resolution of currently available imagery, suggesting that fluvial erosion is not the only major resurfacing mechanism operating in Titan's polar regions.",

Abyssal mixing and the associated upward buoyancy fluxes are necessary to balance the sinking of dense waters at high latitudes and to close the global overturning circulation. Previous studies have concentrated on the hypothesis that the primary mechanism for this mixing is breaking internal waves generated by tidal flows over rough topography. However, intriguing observations, particularly from the Brazil Basin Tracer Release Experiment, suggest that mixing in the flank canyons of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge generated when strong mean flows interact with the many sills and constrictions within the canyons may represent a dynamically important amount of abyssal mixing. The energy pathways and mechanisms of this mixing are much less clear than in the case of breaking internal waves. This study attempts to clarify this by suggesting an analogy with an idealized diffusive boundary layer over a sloping bottom. This boundary layer is characterized by up-slope flows powered by the buoyancy flux in the fluid far from the boundary. Here we explore the energy budget of the boundary layer, and find that the diffusive boundary layer provides flows that are generally consistent with those observed in submarine canyons. In addition, we derive the vertical velocity in the far-field fluid, analogous to an Ekman pumping velocity, that these boundary layers can induce when the bottom slope is not constant. Finally, we present both theoretical and numerical models of exchange flows between the bottom boundary and the far-field flow when the bottom slope is not constant.

    "title": "Studies of climate variability in a simple coupled model",
    "abstract": "The mechanisms of variability of a coupled atmosphere-ocean model are investigated through the study of two coupled configurations: an aquaplanet in which gyres are absent, and an aquaplanet in which a ridge extending from pole to pole supports gyres. Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) are used to explore the main features of variability exhibited by extended integrations of both configurations. In the aquaplanet a decadal variability is observed in the atmosphere and the ocean. Stochastic driving of the annular modes in the atmosphere generates an anomalous Sea Surface Temperature (SST) dipole through latent heat fluxes and Ekman pumping. A feedback of this SST dipole on the atmosphere enables a damping slow enough for anomalies to persist over decadal time scales. This air-sea feedback combined with a slow advection of the anomalies by mean ocean currents result in the observed decadal oscillation. A simple stochastic model captures the essence of this mechanism. In the ridge decadal variability is absent but centennial variability is observed in the atmosphere and the ocean. Stochastic driving of the annular modes in the atmosphere generates a weak SST tripole due to latent heat fluxes. The weak amplitude of this tripole prevents the existence of any significant air-sea feedback, implies a stronger damping than in the aquaplanet, and ultimately results in the absence of oscillations. The classic stochastic model of Hasselmann [19] explains the evolution of the SST anomaly through time. Within a delay of one year stochastic atmospheric variability additionally generates a baroclinic streamfunction as well as baroclinic Rossby waves at the eastern boundary of the basin. The former is slowly advected by the mean flow while the latter propagates towards the western boundary, inducing a feedback on the atmosphere with a delay of sixty years. A simple model is found to capture the essence of this mechanism. The results of the aquaplanet and the ridge are used to interpret the Drake, a third configuration in which a band of land extends from the North Pole to the line of -45' of latitude.

    "text": "Studies of climate variability in a simple coupled model The mechanisms of variability of a coupled atmosphere-ocean model are investigated through the study of two coupled configurations: an aquaplanet in which gyres are absent, and an aquaplanet in which a ridge extending from pole to pole supports gyres. Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) are used to explore the main features of variability exhibited by extended integrations of both configurations. In the aquaplanet a decadal variability is observed in the atmosphere and the ocean. Stochastic driving of the annular modes in the atmosphere generates an anomalous Sea Surface Temperature (SST) dipole through latent heat fluxes and Ekman pumping. A feedback of this SST dipole on the atmosphere enables a damping slow enough for anomalies to persist over decadal time scales. This air-sea feedback combined with a slow advection of the anomalies by mean ocean currents result in the observed decadal oscillation. A simple stochastic model captures the essence of this mechanism. In the ridge decadal variability is absent but centennial variability is observed in the atmosphere and the ocean. Stochastic driving of the annular modes in the atmosphere generates a weak SST tripole due to latent heat fluxes. The weak amplitude of this tripole prevents the existence of any significant air-sea feedback, implies a stronger damping than in the aquaplanet, and ultimately results in the absence of oscillations. The classic stochastic model of Hasselmann [19] explains the evolution of the SST anomaly through time. Within a delay of one year stochastic atmospheric variability additionally generates a baroclinic streamfunction as well as baroclinic Rossby waves at the eastern boundary of the basin. The former is slowly advected by the mean flow while the latter propagates towards the western boundary, inducing a feedback on the atmosphere with a delay of sixty years. A simple model is found to capture the essence of this mechanism. The results of the aquaplanet and the ridge are used to interpret the Drake, a third configuration in which a band of land extends from the North Pole to the line of -45' of latitude. In the northern hemisphere of the Drake mean state and variability are similar to the ones observed in the ridge. The observed centennial oscillation would correspond to a decadal oscillation in the Atlantic. In the southern hemisphere of the Drake, mean state and variability have elements of both the ridge and the aquaplanet."

    "abstract": "This thesis investigates the effects of eddy-eddy interactions (EEI) and tropical wind variability on sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) formation in an idealized atmospheric GCM. Chapter 2 introduces a method to produce split and displacement SSWs in comparable amounts using either wavenumber 1 or 2 tropospheric heating perturbations. The results are compared to those obtained with wavenumber 2 topographic forcing. It is shown that the fraction of SSWs forced by anomalously strong tropospheric wave flux in the model is similar to that of SSWs in the observed atmosphere, but that the fractions for splits and displacements are different. Furthermore, a large fraction of SSWs occur without significant anomalous tropospheric wave flux, indicating that stratospheric transmission of climatological tropospheric wave flux plays an important role in SSW formation. Chapter 3 investigates the effects of EEI on SSW formation in the model by reproducing the model runs from Chapter 2 with EEI turned off in parts of the atmosphere. It is found that SSW frequencies can be strongly dependent on EEI throughout the atmosphere, but that EEI are required locally for splits and displacements to occur. Significant changes in SSW frequencies are obtained by turning off EEI locally, without changing the lower stratospheric wave forcing. Chapter 3 shows that while SSW formation can be considered a wave-mean flow interaction to first order, higher order processes are required to accurately reproduce both SSW frequencies and dynamics. The wavenumber 2 heating run used in Chapters 2 and 3 produce spontaneous tropical wind oscillations in the stratosphere. Chapter 4 identifies the source of these oscillations, and investigates the effects of the oscillations on the stratospheric polar vortex. Model runs with suppressed tropical wind variability are compared to the control run of Chapter 2. A slight increase in SSW frequency can be found in the model runs with suppressed tropical variability. It is found that upper stratospheric equatorial wind anomalies are strongly correlated with polar vortex strength, and hypothesized that westerly equatorial wind anomalies in the upper stratosphere can reinforce the conditions that lead to an anomalously strong polar vortex.

    "abstract": "The recorded seismic signal contains full information about the source that generated the seismic waves and the path along which the seismic waves travel and interfere with subsurface. However, source information is not an explicit part of the seismic record and thus is a large source of uncertainty in seismic imaging and velocity analysis applications. In this thesis, we develop source-independent methods for seismic imaging, seismic trace interpolation and velocity analysis using the interference between pure (PP and SS) and converted-phase (PS and SP) waves. For seismic imaging, we develop amplitude-balancing source-independent converted-phase seismic imaging conditions and introduce a concept of conversion ratio coefficients to provide a physical and mathematical foundation for source-independent converted-phase (SICP) imaging. For seismic trace interpolation, we develop a scheme for migration/de-migration to suppress migration-based artifacts due to sparse station deployments. For velocity analysis, we present first a source-independent space-lag domain Extended SICP imaging condition (ESICP-IC). Then, we mathematically derive an optimization scheme for source independent converted-phase wave equation migration velocity analysis (SICP-WEMVA). We investigate numerically the stability and convergence of SICP-ICs, SICP interpolation and SICP-WEMVA with synthetic data.

    "text": "Theory and application of source independent full wavefield elastic converted phase seismic imaging and velocity analysis The recorded seismic signal contains full information about the source that generated the seismic waves and the path along which the seismic waves travel and interfere with subsurface. However, source information is not an explicit part of the seismic record and thus is a large source of uncertainty in seismic imaging and velocity analysis applications. In this thesis, we develop source-independent methods for seismic imaging, seismic trace interpolation and velocity analysis using the interference between pure (PP and SS) and converted-phase (PS and SP) waves. For seismic imaging, we develop amplitude-balancing source-independent converted-phase seismic imaging conditions and introduce a concept of conversion ratio coefficients to provide a physical and mathematical foundation for source-independent converted-phase (SICP) imaging. For seismic trace interpolation, we develop a scheme for migration/de-migration to suppress migration-based artifacts due to sparse station deployments. For velocity analysis, we present first a source-independent space-lag domain Extended SICP imaging condition (ESICP-IC). Then, we mathematically derive an optimization scheme for source independent converted-phase wave equation migration velocity analysis (SICP-WEMVA). We investigate numerically the stability and convergence of SICP-ICs, SICP interpolation and SICP-WEMVA with synthetic data.

The enhancement extends 1 km above the topography suggesting that mixing is supported by breaking of gravity waves radiated from the ocean bottom.

In this study, we explore the alternative hypothesis that the enhanced mixing in the Southern Ocean is sustained by internal waves generated by geostrophic motions flowing over bottom topography. Weakly-nonlinear theory is used to describe the internal wave generation and the feedback of the waves on the zonally averaged flow. A major finding is that the waves generated at the ocean bottom at finite inverse Froude numbers drive vigorous inertial oscillations. The wave radiation and dissipation at equilibrium is therefore the result of both geostrophic flow and inertial oscillations and differs substantially from the classical lee wave problem. The theoretical predictions are tested versus two-dimensional and three-dimensional high resolution numerical simulations with parameters representative of the Drake Passage region. Theory and fully nonlinear numerical simulations are used to estimate internal wave radiation from LADCP, CTD and topography data from two regions in the Southern Ocean: Drake Passage and the Southeast Pacific.

The theoretical aspects of the work are simplified by restricting attention to the two-dimensional doublyperiodic beta-plane, and in nearly every respect to large-scale zonal flows which are barotropically stable (in a normal-mode sense). The role of the flow inhomogeneity is investigated by considering both nonlinear and linear theory of wave, mean-flow interaction; the key concept to emerge is that of induced spectral transfer of conserved wave quantities by the basic-state flow. Along the way, some new nonlinear conservation laws are derived. In the special case examined of a large-scale zonal jet, the wave enstrophy is approximately conserved in a fully nonlinear sense, and the wave, mean-flow interaction may be characterized as an induced spectral transfer of the wave enstrophy along lines of constant zonal wavenumber k. Because of the scale separation, the linear part of the interaction problem can be closed by applying WKB ray-tracing theory. The turbulent dynamics act to smooth the spectral gradients by irreversible mixing of wave enstrophy; their closure is less easily quantified.

First, we examine the physical processes active during asteroid core crystallization. We model inward crystallization as well as crystal settling and the compaction of a possible cumulate inner core. We then explore the potential strength and longevity of a dynamo in the planetesimal's early history. We find that cumulate inner core solidification would be capable of sustaining a dynamo during the bulk of solidification, but that there may be insufficient power for a dynamo in an inward dendritic solidification scenario. Next, we explore the origin of the magnetic field recorded in the lunar crust. Evidence suggests a core dynamo existed from 4.2 to 3.56 Ga, and possibly until near present day. Seismic measurements indicate the lunar core is partially solidified. Latent heat and concentrated light elements at the interface of a solidifying inner core could drive outer core convection. We demonstrate that core solidification can account for the observationally inferred duration of the lunar dynamo. However, it cannot explain the magnitude of the recorded magnetic field. A dynamo may also stop and restart due to heat flow fluctuations as convective vigor falls below the threshold for dynamo action. Finally, we examine the early history of the Martian mantle. The solidification of a magma ocean may result in an unstable density profile prone to overturn. A long-wavelength instability could play a role in the stark contrasts observed between the northern and southern hemispheres of Mars, including the dichotomy in crustal thickness and magnetization.

Frictional healing is negligible at low humidity and increases with increasing RH for both materials. While the coefficient of sliding friction for powders is independent of humidity, bare surface data indicate that sliding friction decreases with increased RH. Normal stress vibrations in SHS tests can add compaction induced granular strengthening, but for constant normal force tests, chemically assisted healing mechanisms control the friction behavior. The chemically assisted contact junction processes can be reduced or turned off at low humidity at room temperature in quartz and alumina.

    "abstract": "Microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) utilizes sulfate as an electron acceptor and produces sulfide that is depleted in heavy isotopes of sulfur relative to starting sulfate. The fractionation of S-isotopes is commonly used to trace the biogeochemical cycling of sulfur in nature, but a mechanistic understanding of factors that control the range of isotope fractionation is still lacking. This thesis investigates links between the physiology of sulfate reducing bacteria in pure cultures and multiple sulfur isotope (³², ³³, ³⁴34S, and ³⁶S) fractionation during MSR in batch and continuous culture experiments. Experiments address the influence of nutrient and electron donor conditions, including organic carbon, nitrogen, and iron, in cultures of a newly isolated marine sulfate reducing bacterium (DMSS-1). An actively growing culture of DMSS-1 produced sulfide depleted in ³⁴S by 6 to 66%o, depending on the availability and chemistry of organic electron donors. The magnitude of isotope effect correlated well with the cell specific sulfate reduction rate (csSRR), and the largest isotope effects occurred when cultures grew slowly on glucose, a recalcitrant organic substrate. These findings bridge the long-standing discrepancy between the upper limit for S-isotope effect in laboratory cultures and the corresponding observations in nature and indicate that the large (>46 %o) fractionation of S-isotopes does not unambiguously record the oxidative sulfurrecycling. When the availability of iron was limited, the increase in S-isotope fractionation was accompanied by a decrease in the cytochrome c content as well as csSRR. In contrast, growth in nitrogenlimited cultures increased both csSRR and S-isotope fractionation. The influence of individual enzymes and electron carriers involved in sulfate respiration on the fractionation of S-isotopes was also investigated in cultures of mutant strains of Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough. The mutant lacking Type I tetraheme cytochrome c₃ fractionated ³⁴S/³²S ratio 50% greater relative to the wild type. The increasing S-isotope fractionation accompanied the evolution of H2 in the headspace and the decreasing csSRR.

They are naturally produced, they have a unique carbon structure, they are highly halogenated, and they bioaccumulate in upper trophic levels. MBPs share many characteristics with persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and may prove to be useful natural analogues for these anthropogenic compounds. Further, their unique structure suggests that their biosynthetic organism(s) may have new genes to add to current knowledge of biosynthetic chemistry. The objectives of this dissertation were to further clarify the environmental distribution of MBPs, to examine whether MBPs biomagnify, and to investigate possible origins of these compounds through their stable nitrogen isotopic signatures. Results from these investigations have shown that over 40 highly brominated MBP congeners are present in marine mammals, fish, and squid from the Northwestern Atlantic Ocean. The most abundant MBPs do appear to biomagnify through the food web to reach the concentrations observed in marine mammals. This additional evidence affords greater confidence in the use of MBPs as natural analogues for POPs. However, differences in the environmental chemistry of MBPs and anthropogenic compounds are also evident, and may be due to these compounds' different origins, or to the capacity of degradative enzymes to act upon them.",

Further, their unique structure suggests that their biosynthetic organism(s) may have new genes to add to current knowledge of biosynthetic chemistry. The objectives of this dissertation were to further clarify the environmental distribution of MBPs, to examine whether MBPs biomagnify, and to investigate possible origins of these compounds through their stable nitrogen isotopic signatures. Results from these investigations have shown that over 40 highly brominated MBP congeners are present in marine mammals, fish, and squid from the Northwestern Atlantic Ocean. The most abundant MBPs do appear to biomagnify through the food web to reach the concentrations observed in marine mammals. This additional evidence affords greater confidence in the use of MBPs as natural analogues for POPs. However, differences in the environmental chemistry of MBPs and anthropogenic compounds are also evident, and may be due to these compounds' different origins, or to the capacity of degradative enzymes to act upon them."

    "abstract": "A Stoneley wave propagating in a borehole generates a flow of pore fluid in permeable zones intersected by the borehole. In turn, this flow of pore fluid induces a streaming electrical field. This thesis is an experimental and theoretical investigation of the electrical fields induced by Stoneley waves. The main emphasis of this thesis is to understand the electroseismic phenomena that are observed in the field. In the first experiment described in this thesis, we measured Stoneley-wave-induced electrical fields in a borehole drilled through fractured igneous rocks. Analysis of field data confirms that the electrical fields that we measured were induced by fluid flow in fractures. The normalized amplitude of these electrical fields correlated with the fracture density log. In the second experiment, we measured Stoneley-wave-induced electrical fields in several boreholes in vuggy dolomite. In dolomite, the normalized amplitude of the Stoneley-wave-induced electrical field correlates with the porosity of the formation around the borehole. Further, the Stoneley-wave-induced electrical fields have anomalously high amplitudes at an isolated fracture that intersected two boreholes. To explain the experimental results, we developed a theoretical model for the Stoneley-wave-induced electrical fields. According to the model, the normalized amplitude of the Stoneley-wave-induced electrical field is proportional to the porosity and inversely proportional to the pore space tortuosity of a formation around a borehole. Moreover, the amplitude-versus-frequency behavior of this electrical field depends on the permeability of the formation. To further test the theory's prediction, we measured electrical potentials induced by the borehole Stoneley wave in the frequency range from 100Hz to 4kHz. The normalized amplitudes of the Stoneley-wave-induced electrical potentials measured in the field were consistent with the amplitudes predicted by the theory. Also, the amplitude- versus-frequency dependence of the electroseismic signals recorded at the depth of the large fracture roughly followed the trend predicted by the theory. However, the general amplitude-versus-frequency dependence of the electroseismic signals recorded in the field is more complicated than that predicted by the theory. The main contributions of this thesis are: 1. This thesis develops a borehole electroseismic measurement technique and demonstrates that it works in the field. This technique can be used to make electroseismic logging measurements. 2. This thesis investigates an electrical field induced by a borehole Stoneley wave. This electroseismic phenomenon is explained, measured in the field and modeled theoretically. 3. This thesis derives from field data a parameter that describes local electroseismic coupling in a formation around a borehole. This parameter, the normalized amplitude of the Stoneley-wave-induced electrical field, is defined as the ratio of an electrical field amplitude to a pressure amplitude in the Stoneley wave at a certain depth. This thesis demonstrates that the normalized amplitude of the Stoneley-wave- induced electrical field can be used to identify permeable fractures in situ. 4.

The importance of velocity model and how it impacts the depth determination of reservoir-induced events are demonstrated with real field data. A location method that is better-suited than other existing methods for this application is proposed. The accuracy and efficiency of this proposed location method is demonstrated with field data application.Secondly, event locations and interpretations are presented for about 1300 induced events recorded by a near-surface network over a seven year period at a petroleum field in Oman. The event hypocenters delineate two major northeast-southwest striking faults in the field, which are consistent with fault maps derived from reflection seismic interpretations. Spatiotemporal analysis of induced event locations reveals ongoing large scale fault reactivation in the field, and also suggests compaction of the gas reservoir as the major cause and water injection in the oil reservoir as the secondary cause for inducing seismicity in the field.Thirdly, event locations and interpretations are presented for a different set of induced seismicity data recorded by a deep-borehole network over an 11-month period at the same field.

    "abstract": "The mechanisms of magma ascent and emplacement inferred from study of intrusive complexes have long been the subject of intense debate. Current models favor incremental construction, but much of this work has been focused on a single crustal level. However, the study of magmatism throughout the crust is critical for understanding how magma ascends through and intrudes surrounding crustal material. I present new field, geochronologic and geochemical data from three intrusive complexes emplaced at a range of crustal depths in the Cretaceous North Cascades magmatic arc. Integration of geological mapping and high-precision U-Pb TIMS geochronology allows me to demonstrate variable styles of intrusion in different complexes: Assembly of the Black Peak intrusive complex occurred via a series of small (<1 km 3) magmatic increments from ca. 91.7 Ma to 86.8 Ma. My data indicate each of these increments were emplaced and solidified without major assimilation of country rock. The Seven- Fingered Jack intrusive complex, emplaced around ~20-25 km, preserves a similar record of intrusion between ca. 91.8 Ma and 90.5 Ma. Significant compositional variability and antecrystic zircons suggest that the Seven-Fingered Jack represents the remnants of mid-crustal magmatic conduit. Geochronology from the deep-crustal (~25-30 km) Tenpeak intrusive complex, intruded between ca. 92.2 Ma and 89.5 Ma, suggests that plutons comprising the complex were assembled rapidly (<300 ka). These intrusive complexes represent different parts of an arc system, including deep- and shallow-crustal intrusions and a magmatic conduit. I propose a model where increments of magma migrated through the crust in magmatic conduits that were active multiple times. These conduits focused rising magma and served as a crustal filter. Geochronologic and isotopic variability between the Tenpeak and Black Peak intrusive complexes are likely a result of this filtering process and the vastly different conditions in the deep and shallow crust.",

Hydrocarbon biomarkers are chemical fossils in sedimentary rocks that serve as proxies to measure the conditions that prevailed during deposition. In this thesis, biomarkers for redox conditions, depositional environment, microbial community and potential age-related biomarkers have been measured and are reported from four sections that span the Permian-Triassic boundary. The first section, from the Peace River Basin in modern-day western Canada, was deposited on the eastern margin of the Panthalassic Ocean and samples conditions in this global water body. The second section is from Kap Stosch, Greenland, and was deposited on the southern margin of an epicontinental sea situated in the northwest of the supercontinent Pangaea. The Great Bank of Guizhou, China is the third section studied, and it is a carbonate platform deposited on the southern edge of one of the smaller continental blocks that formed the eastern margin of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean.

The biomarker evidence from these sections was measured in ratios, absolute abundances and for 613C isotopic values. This evidence points to global marine conditions dominated by bacterial inputs in which photic zone euxinia was prevalent for extended time periods.

    "title": "The vertical structure of stratospheric planetary waves and its variability : theory and observations",
    "abstract": "Observations of the vertical structure of stratospheric planetary waves reveal a large variety of structures, and a variability both on seasonal and on daily time scales. The extent to which linear wave theory explains these structures and their time evolution at a given time or season is not well known. The sensitivity of linear wave models to details of the basic state and model damping, both of which are not determined from observations in great accuracy, makes it hard to determine why the observations deviate from modeled waves in any given case. In addition, the ability of the observations to resolve the vertical structure of planetary waves is not obvious, given the low vertical resolution of satellite retrievals. The goal of this thesis is to understand the sources of observed variability of vertical wave structure, in particular, to determine whether linear wave theory can explain this variability, and whether the observations are capable of resolving it. We start by testing the ability of satellite retrievals to resolve the vertical structure of the waves. We calculate the radiances that a virtual satellite sitting at the top of our model atmosphere would see, and invert them to obtain retrieved temperature fields. The comparison to the model temperatures suggests that the retrievals are able to resolve their general features quite well, with a few exceptions. Above 1.5mb there is little observed information in the retrievals, and errors start growing above 5 mb. Also, small scale features are not resolvable, but most waves have large enough vertical wavelengths to be resolved. We also identify dynamic situations in the real atmosphere which are more prone to retrieval errors. These are mostly relevant to summer or to the breakup of the polar vortex, when the existence of critical surfaces may cause the waves to have sharp features. The next part consists of understanding the relation between vertical wave structure and the wave propagation characteristics of the basic state in a series of linear wave models, both steady state and time dependent. We study the normal modes on a one dimensional (vertical) troposphere-stratosphere system, using a framework of wave geometry, which allows us to generalize the results to many basic states. A large variety of vertical wave structures is found, similar to observed. This variety is due to the existence of stratospheric turning points. We extend these results to basic states that vary in latitude and height in a nonseparable way. The main problem is how to separate the wave propagation into the vertical and meridional directions. Our approach is diagnostic, where we calculate meridional and vertical wavenumbers from the steady state wave solution to a given basic state, and use them as a diagnostic of the basic state wave propagation characteristics. In particular, we are able to determine the location of turning surfaces for meridional and vertical propagation. By applying this wavenumber diagnostic to many model runs we show that the existence of a stratospheric waveguide renders the problem qualitatively one dimensional by determining the meridional wavenumber, regardless of the characteristics of the tropospheric forcing. In particular, the effects of damping and turning surfaces on the vertical structure are qualitatively as in the vertical propagation problem. In a complementary study, we regard the waves as consisting of many wave activity packets that propagate from the troposphere through the stratosphere, until they dissipate. A technique that follows a wave packet on its journey through the stratosphere, while keeping track of variations in wave activity that are due to refraction of the waves, is introduced and applied to the model runs. This allows us to separate between the contributions to the wave activity budget of damping, refraction, and time variations in the source of wave activity. Also, we can estimate the time scale for vertical propagation through the stratosphere of specific wave events. Finally, we use our diagnostics to study observed wave episodes. We show that the differences in vertical wave structure between middle and late winter episodes in the southern hemisphere can be explained as a linear response to the seasonal evolution of the basic state wave propagation characteristics. We also show that the occasional daily time scale variations of vertical wave structure within a given wave episode are qualitatively a linear response to time variations of the basic state wave propagation characteristics. Since the basic state variations are wave driven, the relevant theory is quasi-linear. Estimates of wave propagation time scales, obtained using our wave activity diagnostic, are also consistent with the theory. We take this is a qualitative assessment of the applicability of quasi-linear wave propagation theory on daily time scales, as well as an assessment of the observations of the waves and the basic state. The latter is not obvious since most of the relevant variations in the basic state occur above 5mb, where observations are less accurate.",

    "title": "Hydrous melt generation in the Earth's mantle",
    "abstract": "This thesis focuses on quantifying the role of H₂O in the generation and modification of mantle melts at shallow pressures in subduction zones. In the first and second chapters, two experimental studies are presented that investigate direct mantle melting and then subsequent reaction of deeper mantle melts with overlying, cooler depleted mantle. In Chapter 1, the melting behavior of an olivine + orthopyroxene +/- spinel - bearing fertile mantle composition is investigated as a function of variable pressure and water content. The experimental results are used to calibrate a model that can predict the pressure and temperature or the temperature and H₂O content of last equilibration for mantle melts that were in equilibrium with olivine orthopyroxene +/- spinel. In Chapter 2, reaction experiments were conducted to explore the role of melt - rock reaction in the shallow part of the mantle wedge. Results demonstrate the importance of both the temperature of the overlying mantle and the amount of infiltrating melt on the mantle lithology that remains after reaction. Reaction coefficients are calculated to quantify the experimental results. In Chapter 3, H₂O solubility was experimentally determined at upper mantle pressures. The 1.0 GPa result is the first H₂O solubility determination in basalt at any pressure above 0.6 GPa. The final chapter is a modeling study that shows how and when to correct for low pressure fractional crystallization to get lavas back to equilibrium with the mantle. Terms are calibrated (in part, on experiments presented in Chapter 1) that add H₂O to spinel lherzolite multiple saturation point models as well as to thermometers and barometers. The H₂O correction provides the quantitative and qualitative basis for making low pressure fractional crystallization corrections to near-primitive hydrous lavas. All chapters contribute to the understanding of subduction zone magmatism, with a particular emphasis on processes in the shallowest region of the mantle wedge.",

    "title": "Analysis and interpretation of tidal currents in the coastal boundary layer",
    "abstract": "Concern with the impact of human activities on the coastal region of the world's oceans has elicited interest in the so-called \"coastal boundary layer\"-that band of water adjacent to the coast where ocean currents adjust to the presence of a boundary. Within this zone, roughly 10 km wide, several physical processes appear to be important. One of these, the tides, is of particular interest because their deterministic nature allows unusually thorough analysis from short time series, and because they tend to obscure the other processes. The Coastal Boundary Layer Transect (COBOLT) experiment was conducted within 12 km of the south shore of Long Island, New York to elucidate the characteristics of the coastal boundary layer in the Middle Atlantic Bight. Analysis of data from this experiment shows that 35% of the kinetic energy of currents averaged over the 30 m depth are due to the semidiurnal and diurnal tides. The tidal ellipses, show considerable vertical structure. Near-surface tidal ellipses rotate in the clockwise direction for semidiurnal and diurnal tides, while near-bottom ellipses rotate in the counterclockwise direction for the semidiurnal tide. The angle between the major axis of the ellipse and the local coastline decreases downward for semidiurnal and increases downward for diurnal tides. The major axis of the tidal ellipse formed from the depth averaged semidiurnal currents is not parallel to the local shoreline  but is oriented at an angle of -15 degrees. This orientation \"tilt\" is a consequence of the onshore flux of energy which is computed to be about 800 watts/m. A constant eddy viscosity model with a slippery bottom boundary condition reproduces the main features observed in the vertical structure of both semidiurnal and diurnal tidal ellipses. Another model employing long, rotational, gravity waves (Sverdrup waves) and an absorbing coastline explains the ellipse orientations and onshore energy flux as a consequence of energy dissipation in shallow water. Finally, an analytical model with realistic topography suggests that tidal dissipation may occur very close (2-3 km) to the shore. Internal tidal oscillations primarily occur at diurnal frequencies in the COBOLT data. Analysis suggests that this energy may be Doppler-shifted to higher frequencies by the mean currents of the coastal region. These motions are trapped to the shore and are almost exclusively first baroclinic mode internal waves.",

We use MERRA reanalysis data and the FMS shallow-water model to compare and contrast their propagation into the stratosphere, their interactions within the stratosphere, and their effects on the polar vortex. The results have implications for the predictability of sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs), theories on the developments of vortex splits and the role of zonal winds in the tropics. In Chapter 2, we use correlations and regressions to demonstrate that the tropopause affects wavenumber one amplitudes more than wavenumber two. Thus, the statistical predictability of SSWs, based on synoptic events in the mid-troposphere (e.g. blockings), is limited. Composites of extreme heat fluxes reveal that they are likely caused by linear interference of the climatology and anomalies. The phases of anomalous planetary waves align with the climatology only during the largest heat fluxes. In Chapter 3, the effect of wave-wave interactions within the stratosphere is quantified by analyzing eddy energy budgets. The energy transfer from wavenumber one toward wavenumber two plays a key role in the vortex split in January 2013 and several other SSWs. This mechanism might explain the growth of wavenumber two in the stratosphere in nonresonant conditions. However, wave-wave interactions are small in averages over all splits since 1979 suggesting that different processes can lead to vortex splits and that the common SSW definitions do not capture the timing of planetary wave growth. In Chapter 4, we employ a shallow-water model to isolate the effects of wave one and two on the polar vortex over a large range of forcing amplitudes and vortex strengths.

A strong correlation between clumped- and hydrogen-isotope signatures in microbial methane is identified and quantitatively linked to the availability of H₂ and the reversibility of microbially-mediated methanogenesis in the environment. Determination of ¹³CH₃D in combination with hydrogen-isotope ratios of methane and water provides a sensitive indicator of the extent of C-H bond equilibration, enables fingerprinting of methane-generating mechanisms, and in some cases, supplies direct constraints for locating the waters from which migrated gases were sourced.

    "title": "Dynamics of the equatorial undercurrent and its determination",
    "abstract": "This study focuses on the zonal weakening, eastern termination and seasonal variations of the Atlantic equatorial undercurrent (EUC). The main and most original contribution of the dissertation is a detailed analysis of the Atlantic EUC simulated by Philander and Pacanowski's (1986)general circulation model (GCM), which provides a novel description of the dynamical regimes governing various regions of a nonlinear stratified undercurrent. Only in a narrow deep western region of the simulation does one find an approximately inertial regime corresponding to zonal acceleration. Elsewhere frictional processes cannot be ignored. The bulk of the mid-basin model EUC terminates in the overlying westward surface flow while only a small fraction (the deeper more inertial layers) terminates at the eastern coast. In agreement with observations, a robust feature of the GCM not present in simpler models is the apparent migration of the EUC core from above the thermocline in the west to below it in the east.

    "text": "Dynamics of the equatorial undercurrent and its determination This study focuses on the zonal weakening, eastern termination and seasonal variations of the Atlantic equatorial undercurrent (EUC). The main and most original contribution of the dissertation is a detailed analysis of the Atlantic EUC simulated by Philander and Pacanowski's (1986)general circulation model (GCM), which provides a novel description of the dynamical regimes governing various regions of a nonlinear stratified undercurrent. Only in a narrow deep western region of the simulation does one find an approximately inertial regime corresponding to zonal acceleration. Elsewhere frictional processes cannot be ignored. The bulk of the mid-basin model EUC terminates in the overlying westward surface flow while only a small fraction (the deeper more inertial layers) terminates at the eastern coast. In agreement with observations, a robust feature of the GCM not present in simpler models is the apparent migration of the EUC core from above the thermocline in the west to below it in the east. In the GCM, this happens because the eastward flow is eroded more efficiently by vertical friction above the base of the thermocline than by lateral friction at greater depths.

    "title": "Numerical modeling, suppression, and imaging of elastic wave scattering by near-surface heterogeneities",
    "abstract": "In arid environments, near-surface complexity and surface topography present major challenges to land seismic data acquisition and processing. These challenges can severely affect data quality and introduce uncertainty into reservoir imaging and characterization. The primary objectives of this thesis are to model and study the contribution of near-surface heterogeneities on seismic wavefield scattering for better understanding of land seismic data, develop an effective approach to filter out the scattered noise from the seismic records to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, and to accurately image and locate the near-surface heterogeneities. The first part of this thesis is concerned with simulating the effects of seismic wave scattering from buried, shallow, subsurface heterogeneities through finite difference numerical forward modeling. The near-surface scattered wavefield is modeled by separating the incident (i.e., in the absence of scatterers) from the total wavefield by means of a perturbation method. Wave propagation is simulated for several earth models with different near-surface characteristics to isolate and quantify the influence of scattering on the quality of the seismic signal. We show that the scattered field is equivalent to the radiation field of an equivalent elastic source excited at the scatterer locations. Moreover, the scattered waves consist mostly of body waves scattered to surface waves and are, generally, as large as, or larger than, the reflections. These scattered waves often obscure weak primary reflections and can severely degrade the image quality. The results indicate that the scattered energy depends strongly on the properties of the shallow scatterers and increases with increasing impedance contrast, increasing sizes of the scatterers, decreasing depth of the scatterers, and increasing the attenuation factor of the background medium. Also, sources deployed at depth generate weak surface waves, whereas deep receivers record weak scattered surface waves. The analysis and quantified results help in the understanding of the scattering mechanisms and, therefore, can lead to developing new acquisition and processing techniques to reduce the scattered surface waves and enhance the quality of the seismic image. The second part of this thesis develops an approach based on spatially varying local-slope estimation, aiming at alleviating the effects of scattered surface waves and enhancing the quality of the seismic signal. Understanding the mechanism and behavior of the simulated scattered surface waves in the first part of this thesis form the basis for designing the filtering scheme. The algorithm is based on predicting the spatially varying slope of the noise, using steerable filters, and separating the signal and noise components by applying a directional non-linear filter oriented toward the noise direction to predict the noise and then subtract it from the data. The slope estimation step using steerable filters is very efficient, as it requires only a linear combination of a set of basis filters at fixed orientation to synthesize an image filtered at an arbitrary orientation. We apply our filtering approach to simulated data as well as to seismic data recorded in the field to suppress the scattered surface waves from reflected body-waves, and demonstrate its superiority over conventional f - k techniques in signal preservation and noise suppression. The third part of this thesis presents an approach for prestack elastic reverse time migration (RTM) to locate and image near-surface heterogeneities using the near-surface scattered waves (e.g., body to P, S, and surface waves). The approach back-projects the scattered waves until they are in phase with the incident waves at the scatterer locations. The P wave components (divergence of the wavefield) are derived from the spatial derivatives of the measured wavefields. Imaging the near-surface heterogeneities is important for planning seismic surveys or explaining nearsurface related anomalies in the data. The scattered body-to-surface waves travel horizontally along the free surface, and, therefore, they provide optimal illumination of the near-surface compared to scattered body-to-body waves. Additionally, the elastic RTM scheme preserves the relative amplitude because all wave propagation losses, including mode conversions, are properly taken into account. We demonstrate, using synthetic data, that elastic RTM of near-surface scattered waves constructs an accurate and reliable depth image of near-surface scatterers.",

    "abstract": "Internal hydraulic jumps in flows with upstream shear are investigated numerically and theoretically. The role of upstream shear has not previously been thoroughly investigated, although it is important in many oceanographic flows such as exchange flows and stratified flow over topography. Several two-layer shock joining theories, characterized by their distribution of dissipation in the jump, are considered and extended to include upstream shear, entrainment, and topography. Theoretical results are also compared to 2D and some 3D numerical simulations of the full Navier-Stokes equations, which allow continuous velocity and density distributions. The solution space of idealized jumps with small upstream shear is identified using two-layer theories, which shows that upstream shear allows larger jumps to form and allows jumps for a larger range of parameters. Numerical simulations reveal several jump structures that can occur in these flows, including an undular bore, a fully turbulent jump, and a smooth front turbulent jump. At low shear, the 2D mixing efficiency is constant across simulations. As shear increases, the basic two-layer theories no longer provide solutions. Numerical simulations show that entrainment becomes significant as the shear increases, and adding entrainment and shape parameters to describe the continuous velocity profiles is required to accurately describe the simulations using two-layered theory. The entrainment depends on the upstream shear and can be predicted with a modified theory. However, use of the theory is limited due to its sensitivity to the value of the shape parameters. The 2D mixing efficiency also decreases significantly as shear increases. Finally, more realistic 2D and some 3D simulations including topography bridge the gap between the highly idealized simulations and the very realistic work of others.

Chapter 1 investigates the effects of the Marion and Bouvet hotspots on the ultra-slow spreading, highly-segmented Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR).

Building upon this observation, Chapter 2 presents a series of 3D numerical models designed to quantify the sensitivity of along-axis plume-driven mantle flow to transform offset length, spreading rate, and mantle viscosity structure. The calculations illustrate that long-offset transforms in ultra-slow spreading environments may significantly curtail plume dispersion. Chapter 3 investigates helium isotope systematics along the western SWIR as well as near a global array of hotspots. The first part of this study reports uniformly low 3He/4He ratios of 6.3-7.3 R/Ra along the SWIR from 9⁰-24⁰E, compared to values of 8 +/- 1 Ra for normal mid-ocean ridge basalt.

The timing and mechanisms of uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and the Altiplano are the subject of ongoing debate. Central issues include the strength of the lower crust and the role of lower crustal flow, the relative importance of continuous deformation versus block deformation, and the possibility of lithospheric delamination. The goal of this thesis is to further explore several of these issues using a combination of numerical modeling, field observations, and thermochronology. I investigate controls on the large-scale evolution of the Tibetan Plateau and the Altiplano using a new quasithree-dimensional viscous flow model that allows for both the development of a weak lower crust and lateral and temporal viscosity variations. Modeling motivated by the Tibetan Plateau shows that lateral variations in crustal strength can have a significant effect on surface velocities throughout the plateau, as well as on the location, shape, and slope of plateau margins and the overall plateau morphology. Model results suggest that crustal strength heterogeneities may be responsible for a number of seemingly unrelated aspects of Tibetan Plateau morphology and deformation. Modeling motivated by the Altiplano explores the relationship between subduction angle, the strength of the lower crust, crustal thickening, and surface shortening in the Central Andes. Model results illustrate that lower crustal flow above regions of steep-slab subduction can redistribute material along strike and can explain discrepancies between surface shortening and crustal thickness in the northern and southern Altiplano. I address the distribution of Middle Cenozoic deformation on the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau by using field observations and thermochronology to document an episode of extension and constrain its timing to the Oligocene.

    "abstract": "The traditional approach of improving radar range resolution using a linear frequency modulated chirp signal requires the full width of the frequency spectrum, which is not feasible in the UHF band due to interference or frequency allocation for other purposes. In this study a linear frequency modulated chirp signal is approximated using two stepped-frequency pulse train waveforms, a continuous wave pulse train and a linear frequency modulated pulse train. The continuous wave pulse train consists of a series of single frequency pulses, each at a different frequency. It is found to be susceptible to corruption due to target motion. The linear frequency modulated pulse train consists of linear frequency modulation within pulses, each at a different center frequency. Simulations are used to demonstrate that both approaches approximate a linear frequency modulated chirp signal, and performance is degraded when there is a gap in the frequency band or if there is phase distortion due to target motion. However, it is shown that a linear frequency modulated pulse train with frequency overlaps between pulses can be used to reduce or eliminate phase distortions resulting from target motion provided the target is moving with constant velocity. The validity of the technique is demonstrated by non-coherently processing radar data from an internal moving target simulator and data from actual planes to resolve targets from their reflected image in order to estimate target height.",

It is a scalable and flexible solution for researchers and practitioners to build predictive models from physiological time series data. It allows users to specify arbitrary features and conditions to train the model, computing everything in parallel in the cloud. PhysioMiner is tested on a large dataset of electrocardiography (ECG) from 6000 patients in the MIMIC database. Signals are cleaned and processed, and features are extracted per period. A total of 1.2 billion heart beats were processed and 26 billion features were extracted resulting in half a terabyte database. These features were aggregated for windows corresponding to patient events. These aggregated features were fed into DELPHI, a multi algorithm multi parameter cloud based system to build a predictive model. An area under the curve of 0.693 was achieved for an acute hypotensive event prediction from the ECG waveform alone. The results demonstrate the scalability and flexibility of PhysioMiner on real world data.

    "abstract": "This thesis presents a complete VLSI design of improved low complexity chase (LCC) decoders for Reed-Solomon (RS) codes. This is the first attempt in published research that implements LCC decoders at the circuit level. Based on the joint algorithm research with University of Hawaii, we propose several new techniques for complexity reduction in LCC decoders and apply them in the VLSI design for RS [255, 239,17] (LCC255) and RS [31, 25, 7] (LCC31) codes. The major algorithm improvement is that the interpolation is performed over a subset of test vectors to avoid redundant decoding. Also the factorization formula is reshaped to avoid large computation complexity overlooked in previous research. To maintain the effectiveness of algorithm improvements, we find it necessary to adopt the systematic message encoding, instead of the evaluation-map encoding used in the previous work on interpolation decoders. The LCC255 and LCC31 decoders are both implemented in 90nm CMOS process with the areas of 1.01mm 2 and 0.255mm 2 respectively. Simulations show that with 1.2V supply voltage they can achieve the energy efficiencies of 67pJ/bit and 34pJ/bit at the maximum throughputs of 2.5Gbps and 1.3Gbps respectively. The proposed algorithm changes, combined with optimized macro- and micro-architectures, result in a 70% complexity reduction (measured with gate count). This new LCC design also achieves 17x better energy-efficiency than a standard Chase decoder (projected from the most recent reported Reed Solomon decoder implementation) for equivalent area, latency and throughput. The comparison of the two decoders links the significantly higher decoding energy cost to the better decoding performance. We quantitatively compute the cost of the decoding gain as the adjusted area of LCC255 being 7.5 times more than LCC31.",

    "text": "Efficient silicon micro-reactors for thermophotovoltaic applications Thermophotovoltaic (TPV) systems passively generate electricity from the combustion of fuel. Although TPV conversion systems have advantages, they suffer from low efficiency. This thesis investigates different ways to increase the efficiency of TPV systems. In particular the thesis details micro-fabrication of silicon micro-reactors, and twodimensional tungsten photonic crystals (2D W PhC) for high-temperature applications such as selective thermal emitters for TPV energy conversion. Interference lithography and reactive ion etching are used to produce large-area single-crystal tungsten 2D PhC's. The fabricated PhC consists of an array of cylindrical cavities with 800nm diameter, 1.2 pm depth, and 1.2 pm period. Extensive characterization and calibration of all micro-fabrication steps for both micro-reactors and 2D PhC's are presented. Experimentally-obtained thermal emission spectra of the 2D PhC structures match well with numerical predictions."

    "abstract": "In this thesis, a geometric framework for describing relevant information in a collection of data is applied for the general problems of selecting informative features (dimension reduction) from high dimensional data. The framework can be used in an unsupervised manner, extracting universal features that can be used later for general classification of data. This framework is derived by applying local approximations on the space of probability distributions and a small perturbation approach. With this approach, different information theoretic results can be interpreted as linear algebra optimizations based on the norms of vectors in a linear space, which are in general, easier to carry out. Fundamentally, using known procedures such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), dimension reduction for maximizing power can be achieved in a straight forward manner. Using the geometric framework, we relate calculation of SVD of a particular matrix related to a probabilistic channel to the application of Alternating Conditional Expectation (ACE) in the problem of optimal regression. The key takeaway of this method is that such problems can be studied in the space of distributions of the data and not the space of outcomes. This geometric framework allows to give an operational meaning to information metrics in the context of data analysis and feature selection. Additionally, it provides a method to obtain universal classification functions without knowledge of the important feature of the problem.

    "abstract": "Our goal is to understand the functioning of the interbank lending market in times of market stress. Working towards this goal, we conduct theoretical analysis and simulation to study the effects of network structure and shock scenarios on systemic risk in the market. We consider shocks of various sizes at both global and local scales. In terms of risk measures, we study relative systemic loss and the default rate, separating the latter quantity into fundamental default and contagion. Our simulations suggest that all systemic risk measures are similar on the well-studied directed Erdős-Rényi model and the more complex fitness model if we match the mean density and the mean edge weight of these two models. We show through both derivations and simulations that the network size has little effect on systemic risk when the network is sufficiently large. Moreover, as the mean degree grows, the different default rates considered all increase, while relative systemic loss decreases. Furthermore, simulations suggest that local shocks tend to cause more harm than global shocks of the same total size. We also derive upper and lower bounds on a bank's probability of default, only using its neighbors' information. For implementation, we build a method for real-time, automatic, interpretable assessment of financial systemic risk, which only requires temporal snapshots of observable data. Our algorithm takes in partial data, inferring a random graph model, and then generates empirical distributions for risk measures. The first part relies on inferring a fitness model that is compatible with observed information. For the second part, we use simulations to obtain empirical distributions for systemic risk that arises from interbank clearing. We test our method on synthetic data and apply it to the federal funds market using empirical data. Our method is fast enough to be incorporated into algorithms that produce intraday time trajectories of risk prediction.

These interactive lesson plans go beyond the use of StarLogoTNG to complete specific tasks by integrating meaningful class discussions and occasional peer instruction and peer review activities. Such activities become catalysts for students to develop a deeper understanding of the course materials. By connecting learning goals from different themes of the course and packaging them in cohesive lesson plans that utilize methods of teaching for understanding, this thesis aims to provide a useful and effective set of a materials for the instruction of computer science principles."

Current methods for determining ICP are invasive, require neurosurgical expertise, and can lead to infection. ICP measurement is therefore limited to the sickest patients, though many others could potentially benefit from availability of this vital sign. We present a frequency-domain approach to ICP estimation using a simple lumped, linear time-invariant model of cerebrovascular dynamics.

    "abstract": "Light detection and ranging (LIDAR) has become an ubiquitous ranging technology. LIDAR systems are integral to almost all autonomous vehicles and robotics. Most LIDAR systems today use discrete free-space optical components and utilize a mechanical apparatus for beam steering. Apart from the relative high cost of the system, this mechanical apparatus limits the scan rate of the LIDAR system while increasing both size and complexity. This leads to concerns about long-term reliability, especially in harsh environments. In this thesis, the design and experimental results of an integrated chip-scale frequency-modulated continuous-wave LIDAR system are presented. This system has the capability of measuring both distance and velocity simultaneously with a 20mm resolution and a 2m range. Its functionality is then extended by utilizing optical phased arrays as a transmitter and receiver for solid-state beam steering. The phased array utilized has a grouped cascaded phase shifter architecture and is shown to have a steering range of 46°x36°. This is the first integrated coherent LIDAR system based on optical phased arrays. In order to have a viable LIDAR system with optical phased arrays, high beam powers and large aperture sizes are needed. A silicon nitride distribution network is used to enable high on-chip power because of the low material nonlinearities. An ultra-high main beam power of 520mW is reported. A phased array is demonstrated with an ultra-large aperture size of 4x4mm2, achieving a record-small and near diffraction limited spot size of 0.021°x0.021° with a side lobe suppression of 10 dB. This is the largest optical phased array to date by an order of magnitude and shows the scalability of optical phased arrays.

    "abstract": "Power monitoring is needed in most electrical systems, and is crucial for ensuring reliability in everything from industrial and telecom applications, to automotive and consumer electronics. Power monitoring of integrated circuits (ICs) is also essential, as today ICs exist in most electrical and electronic systems, in a vast range of applications. Many ICs, including power ICs, have functional blocks across the chip that are used for different purposes. Measuring circuit block currents in both analog and digital ICs is important in a wide range of applications, including power management as well as IC testing and fault detection and analysis. For example, the presence of different kinds of faults in IC circuit blocks during IC fabrication causes the currents flowing through these circuit blocks to change from the expected values. There has been general interest in monitoring currents through different circuit blocks in an attempt to identify the location and type of the faults. Previous works on non intrusive load monitoring as well as on power-line communications (PLCs) provide motivation for the work presented here. The techniques are extended and used to develop a new method for power monitoring in ICs. Most solutions to the challenge of measuring currents in different circuit blocks of the IC involve adding circuitry that is both costly and power consuming. In this work, a new method is proposed to enable individual measurement of current consumed in each circuit block within an IC while adding negligible area and power overhead. This method works by encoding the individual current signatures in the main supply current of the IC, which can then be sensed and sampled off-chip, and then disaggregated through signal processing.

    "abstract": "GaN Metal Insulator Semiconductor High Electron Mobility Transistors (GaN MIS-HEMTs) show excellent promise as high voltage power transistors that can operate efficiently at high temperatures and frequencies. However, current GaN technology faces several obstacles, one of which is Time-Dependent Dielectric Breakdown (TDDB) of the gate dielectric. Under prolonged electrical stress, the gate dielectric suffers a catastrophic breakdown that renders the transistor useless. Understanding the physics behind gate dielectric breakdown and accurately estimating the average time to failure of the dielectric are of critical importance. TDDB is conventionally studied under DC conditions. However, as actual device operation in power circuits involves rapid switching between on and off states, it is important to determine if estimations done from DC stress results are accurate. Due to the rich dynamics of the GaN MIS-HEMT system such as electron trapping and carrier accumulation at the dielectric/AlGaN interface, unaccounted physics might be introduced under AC stress that may cause error in DC estimation. To this end, we characterize TDDB behavior of GaN MIS-HEMTs at both DC stress conditions and more accurate AC stress conditions. We find that TDDB behavior is improved for AC stress compared to DC stress conditions at high stress frequencies. At 100 kHz, the average dielectric breakdown time is twice the average dielectric breakdown time under DC stress conditions. Furthermore, the impact of tensile mechanical stress on TDDB under DC stress is investigated. This is an important concern because of the piezoelectric nature of GaN and the substantial lattice mismatch between Si, GaN and AlGaN that results in high mechanical strain in the active portion of the device. If mechanical stress significantly impacts TDDB, designers will have to work with further constraints to ensure minimal stress across the dielectric. To address this, we have carried out measurements of TDDB under [epsilon] = 0.29% tensile strain. We find that TDDB in both the On-state and Off-state stress conditions are unaffected by this mechanical stress. Through measurements done in this thesis, we gather further insight towards understanding the physics behind TDDB. Through AC stress we find that the dynamics of the GaN MIS-HEMTs prolong dielectric breakdown times. Through mechanical stress we find that modulation of the 2-Dimensional Electron Gas and dielectric bond straining have minimal impact on TDDB.",

We find that TDDB in both the On-state and Off-state stress conditions are unaffected by this mechanical stress. Through measurements done in this thesis, we gather further insight towards understanding the physics behind TDDB. Through AC stress we find that the dynamics of the GaN MIS-HEMTs prolong dielectric breakdown times. Through mechanical stress we find that modulation of the 2-Dimensional Electron Gas and dielectric bond straining have minimal impact on TDDB."

The current technique used to locate the arrhythmic site suffers from a number of drawbacks. Ablation is a trial-and-error procedure and may require many hours, during which the arrhythmia is ongoing. Patients with hemodynamically unstable VT are therefore excluded, as are those with more complex arrhythmias, accounting for an estimated 90% of patients. Furthermore, the technique is only successful in 71% to 76% of the cases to which it is applied. A new algorithm was recently identified that allows the non-invasive and rapid detection of the origin of an arrhythmia from body-surface ECG signals, making the RFA procedure accessible to many patients hitherto excluded. Software implementing this algorithm, and providing a multi-layer graphical user-interface to operate in conjunction with an RFA device, has been designed and implemented.

    "title": "Adaptive delivery of real-time streaming video",
    "abstract": "While there is an increasing demand for streaming video applications on the Internet, various network characteristics make the deployment of these applications more challenging than traditional Internet applications like email and the Web. The applications that transmit data over the Internet must cope with the time-varying bandwidth and delay characteristics of the Internet and must be resilient to packet loss. This thesis examines these challenges and presents a system design and implementation that ameliorates some of the important problems with video streaming over the Internet. Video sequences are typically compressed in a format such as MPEG-4 to achieve bandwidth efficiency. Video compression exploits redundancy between frames to achieve higher compression. However, packet loss can be detrimental to compressed video with interdependent frames because errors potentially propagate across many frames. While the need for low latency prevents the retransmission of all lost data, we leverage the characteristics of MPEG-4 to selectively retransmit only the most important data in order to limit the propagation of errors. We quantify the effects of packet loss on the quality of MPEG-4 video, develop an analytical model to explain these effects, and present an RTP-compatible protocol-which we call SR-RTP--to adaptively deliver higher quality video in the face of packet loss. The Internet's variable bandwidth and delay make it difficult to achieve high utilization, Tcp friendliness, and a high-quality constant playout rate; a video streaming system should adapt to these changing conditions and tailor the quality of the transmitted bitstream to available bandwidth. Traditional congestion avoidance schemes such as TCP's additive-increase/multiplicative/decrease (AIMD) cause large oscillations in transmission rates that degrade the perceptual quality of the video stream. To combat bandwidth variation, we design a scheme for performing quality adaptation of layered video for a general family of congestion control algorithms called binomial congestion control and show that a combination of smooth congestion control and clever receiver-buffered quality adaptation can reduce oscillations, increase interactivity, and deliver higher quality video for a given amount of buffering. We have integrated this selective reliability and quality adaptation into a publicly available software library. Using this system as a testbed, we show that the use of selective reliability can greatly increase the quality of received video, and that the use of binomial congestion control and receiver quality adaptation allow for increased user interactivity and better video quality.",

A large number of techniques have been proposed to efficiently partition a dataset, often focusing on finding the best partitioning for a particular query workload.

Furthermore, workloads change over time as businesses evolve or as analysts gain better understanding of their data.

We present the data structures, partitioning algorithms, and an efficient implementation on top of Apache Spark and HDFS. Our experimental results show that the Amoeba storage system provides improved query performance for ad-hoc workloads, adapts to changes in the query workloads, and converges to a steady state in case of recurring workloads.

We formulate the problem of finding the minimum energy cooperative route for a wireless network under idealized channel and receiver models. Fundamental to the understanding of the routing problem is the understanding of the optimal power allocation for a single message transmission between two sets of nodes. We present the solution to this problem, and use that as the basis for solving the minimum energy cooperative routing problem. We analytically obtain the energy savings in regular line and regular grid networks. We propose heuristics for selecting the cooperative route in random networks and give simulation results confirming significant energy savings achieved through cooperation. In the second part, we study the problem of route reliability in a multi-hop network. We look at the reliability issue at the link level and extend those result to a wireless network setting. In the network setting, we first define and analyze the reliability for a fixed route and then propose algorithms for finding the optimal route between a source-destination pair of nodes. The relationship between the route reliability and consumed power is studied. The idea of route diversity is introduced as a way to improve the reliability by taking advantage of the broadcast property, the independence of fading state between different pairs of nodes, and space diversity created by multiple intermediate relay nodes along the route.

Conventionally, data is stored in relational databases that have been refined over decades, resulting in highly optimized data processing engines. However, the awkwardness of expressing iterative queries in SQL makes the relational query-processing model inadequate for graph analytics, leading to many alternative solutions. Our research explores the possibility of combining a more natural query model with relational databases for graph analytics. In particular, we bring together a graph-natural vertex-centric query interface to highly optimized column-oriented relational databases, thus providing the efficiency of relational engines and ease-of-use of new graph systems. Throughout the thesis, we used stochastic gradient descent, a loss-minimization algorithm applied in many machine learning and graph analytics queries, as the example iterative algorithm. We implemented two different approaches for emulating a vertex-centric interface on a leading column-oriented database, Vertica: disk-based and main-memory based. The disk-based solution stores data for each iteration in relational tables and allows for interleaving SQL queries with graph algorithms. The main-memory approach stores data in memory, allowing faster updates. We applied optimizations to both implementations, which included refining logical and physical query plans, applying algorithm-level improvements and performing system-specific optimizations. The experiments and results show that the two implementations provide reasonable performance in comparison with popular graph processing systems.

Improvement in hardware and virtualization technology, coupled with the use of virtualization for desktop machines with modest steady-state resource utilization, is expected to allow individual hosts to run thousands of VMs at the same time. Such high VM densities per host would allow data centers to reap unprecedented cost-savings in the future. Unfortunately, unusually high CPU and memory pressure generated when many VMs boot up concurrently can cripple hosts that can otherwise run many VMs. Over provisioning hardware to avoid prohibitively high boot latencies that result from these - often daily - boot storms is clearly expensive. The aim of this thesis is to investigate whether a hypervisor could theoretically exploit the overlap in the instruction streams of concurrently booting VMs to reduce CPU pressure in boot storms. This idea, which we name silhouette execution, would allow hypervisors to use the CPU in a scalable way, much like transparent page sharing allows a hypervisor to use its limited memory in a scalable fashion. To evaluate silhouette execution, we studied user-space instruction streams from a few Linux services using dynamic instrumentation. We statistically profiled the extent of nondeterminism in program execution, and compiled the reasons behind any execution differences. Though there is significant overlap in the user-mode instruction streams of Linux services, our simple simulations show that silhouette execution would increase CPU pressure by 13% for 100 VMs and 6% for 1000 VMs. To remedy this, we present a few strategies for reducing synthetic differences in execution in user-space programs.

The StreamIt Development Tool (SDT) [25] is designed to aid the coding and simultaneous code- and graph-based debugging and visualizing of programs written in StreamIt. The goal is to provide a graphical programming environment that simply and intuitively conveys the hierarchical and structured nature of the StreamIt language by visually interpreting the dynamic behavior and graph representation of a StreamIt application. Consequently, the SDT provides utilities for program creation and code editing, compilation and launch support, breakpoints and code stepping, general debugging infrastructure, help support, stream graph examination and navigation, and stream data display, modification, and tracking. A user study evaluating the SDT uncovered several problems and areas of improvement that need to be addressed before this tool can approach its goals. Assessment of the SDT's efficacy in its current state is inconclusive--the SDT demonstrates both the ability to improve and hinder a user's debugging ability. Facilitating effective coding and debugging techniques and developing for scalability are critical elements in improving the SDT's effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "PetaBricks [4, 21, 7, 3, 5] is an implicitly parallel programming language which, through the process of autotuning, can automatically optimize programs for fast QoS-aware execution on any hardware. In this thesis we develop and evaluate two PetaBricks autotuners: INCREA and SiblingRivalry. INCREA, based on a novel bottom-up evolutionary algorithm, optimizes programs offline at compile time. SiblingRivalry improves on INCREA by optimizing online during a program's execution, dynamically adapting to changes in hardware and the operating system. Continuous adaptation is achieved through racing, where half of available resources are devoted to always-on learning. We evaluate INCREA and SiblingRivalry on a large number of real-world benchmarks, and show that our autotuners can significantly speed up PetaBricks programs with respect to many non-tuned and mis-tuned baselines. Our results indicate the need for a continuous learning loop that can optimize efficiently by exploiting online knowledge of a program's performance. The results leave open the question of how to solve the online optimization problem on all cores, i.e. without racing.",

A system is demonstrated here for using imitation learning to teach a robot to grasp objects using both hand and whole-body grasps, which use the arms and torso as well as hands. Demonstration grasp trajectories are created by teleoperating a simulated robot to pick up simulated objects, and stored as sequences of keyframes in which contacts with the object are gained or lost. When presented with a new object, the system compares it against the objects in a stored database to pick a demonstrated grasp used on a similar object. Both objects are modeled as a combination of primitives-boxes, cylinders, and spheres-and the primitives for each object are grouped into 'functional groups' that geometrically match parts of the new object with similar parts of the demonstration object. These functional groups are then used to map contact points from the demonstration object to the new object, and the resulting adapted keyframes are adjusted and checked for feasibility. Finally, a trajectory is found that moves among the keyframes in the adapted grasp sequence, and the full trajectory is tested for feasibility by executing it in the simulation.

Included are basic design tools to enable writing ALA software, the necessary hardware designs for implementation, and simulation techniques for quickly verifying correctness and performance. This thesis also documents many of the hazards and opportunities for improving them including helpful variations to the ALA model, design tool needs, better simulation models, and hardware improvements. To embody software you could compile a hardware description language to an FPGA or synthesize it all the way to transistors. Alternatively, you could use your favorite high level language and run it on a standard processor. However, the widening gap between traditional models of computation and the reality of the underlying hardware has led to massive costs for design and fabrication as well as numerous issues for scalability and portability. Unlike any of these other approaches, ALA aligns computational and physical descriptions making it possible to use a direct one-to-one mapping to convert an ALA program to a circuit or other physical artifact that executes that program. No unpredictable fitters or compilers are needed and no extra expertise is needed for specific technologies. Similar to Mead-Conway design rules ALA designs trade flexibility for portability and ease of design. Unlike Mead- Conway design rules, ALA designs do not require any further verification-the design rule primitives are logical operations suitable for use in analysis at the algorithmic level. ALA separates many of the scaling issues that plague integrated circuit design by cleanly separating algorithm design from hardware engineering-improving design verification, tape-out costs (by reusing masks), yield, portability, and the ability to break designs across multiple chips. ALA designs are not limited to integrated circuits and could just as easily be implemented in microfluidics, magnetic logic, or a lattice of molecular logic gates.

    "abstract": "The combination of reflectance, fluorescence, and Raman spectroscopy - which is termed multimodal spectroscopy (MMS) - provides complementary and depth-sensitive information about tissue composition. As such, MMS can provide biochemical and morphological information useful in detecting vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques, that is, plaques most prone to rupture and causing sudden death. Early detection of these vulnerable plaques is critical to reducing patient mortality associated with cardiovascular disease. In developing MMS into a clinical diagnostic modality, several scientific and engineering directions are explored in this work: the physical motivation for MMS, the framework of quantitative extraction of spectral parameters, the spectral probes that enable the efficient collection of data, a clinical instrument able to provide real-time diagnosis, and, finally, a clinical implementation of the entire methodology. The motivation for MMS is shown through a pilot in vitro study using carotid artery specimens, which shows the promise for MMS to detect features of vulnerable plaque. Having established the motivation, the next step describes the mathematical tools used to extract quantitative spectral parameters and, moreover, to assess the uncertainty and confidence of the spectral information. In order to implement MMS, the development of an efficient, specialized MMS probe for data acquisition and a compact and practical clinical MMS instrument are described. Lastly, in vivo and ex vivo results from a relatively large clinical study of vulnerable plaque in humans show excellent agreement between MMS and histopathology.

    "text": "Development of multimodal spectroscopy for the detection of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques The combination of reflectance, fluorescence, and Raman spectroscopy - which is termed multimodal spectroscopy (MMS) - provides complementary and depth-sensitive information about tissue composition. As such, MMS can provide biochemical and morphological information useful in detecting vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques, that is, plaques most prone to rupture and causing sudden death. Early detection of these vulnerable plaques is critical to reducing patient mortality associated with cardiovascular disease. In developing MMS into a clinical diagnostic modality, several scientific and engineering directions are explored in this work: the physical motivation for MMS, the framework of quantitative extraction of spectral parameters, the spectral probes that enable the efficient collection of data, a clinical instrument able to provide real-time diagnosis, and, finally, a clinical implementation of the entire methodology. The motivation for MMS is shown through a pilot in vitro study using carotid artery specimens, which shows the promise for MMS to detect features of vulnerable plaque. Having established the motivation, the next step describes the mathematical tools used to extract quantitative spectral parameters and, moreover, to assess the uncertainty and confidence of the spectral information. In order to implement MMS, the development of an efficient, specialized MMS probe for data acquisition and a compact and practical clinical MMS instrument are described. Lastly, in vivo and ex vivo results from a relatively large clinical study of vulnerable plaque in humans show excellent agreement between MMS and histopathology. Specifically, MMS is shown to have the ability to detect a thin fibrous cap, necrotic core or superficial foam cells, and thrombus."

    "abstract": "We report measurements of the temperature and power dependence of the microwave frequency intermodulation distortion (IMD) in high quality pulsed laser deposition (PLD) Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide (YBCO) on LaAlO3 substrate. A low-temperature (T < 30 K) increase in IMD is the observation of an upturn of the nonlinear coefficient of the quadratic field dependence of the penetration depth. This IMD upturn is limited by the nonlinear Meissner effect that has been predicted for d-wave high-T, superconductors. Various amounts of IMD increase are observed for different films with impurity (Ni, Zn and Ca) doping and other defects. The demonstration of the IMD upturn and the nonlinear Meissner effect were possible because the IMD measurement is an extremely sensitive method to detect the penetration depth change at even less than 0.01 nm. IMDs from various samples tend to merge at a single universal value at 0 K regardless of disorder, defects, and impurities due to the node singularity at 0 K. There is a similar converging trend in IMD towards the transition temperature T, due to the quasiparticle thermal excitation and depletion of superelectrons.

    "abstract": "III-V multi-junction solar cells currently have the highest reported theoretical and experimental energy conversion efficiency but their cost, mainly attributed to the use of expensive substrates, limits their widespread use for terrestrial applications. Successful integration of III--V's on a Si substrate to enable a III-V/Si tandem cell can lower the cost of energy by combining the high-efficiency of the III--V materials with the low-cost and abundance of the Si substrate. A maximum theoretical efficiency of 44.8% from a tandem cell on Si can be achieved by using a GaAsP (Eg=1.7 eV) as the top cell. Out of several possible integration routes, the use of a linearly graded SiGe buffer as interfacial layer between the two cells potentially yields the highest quality for the epitaxial GaAsP layer, an essential requirement for realization of high-efficiency solar cells. In this thesis, the impact of the SiGe buffer layer on the optical and electrical characteristics of the bottom Si cell of a GaAsP/Si tandem solar cell was assessed via experimental work. The growth of a SiGe buffer layer was shown to increase the threading dislocation density and as a result the leakage current of the bottom Si cell by about 10x. In addition, the low-bandgap SiGe absorbs more than 80% of the light that is intended for the Si sub-cell, reducing the short-circuit current of the Si cell from 33 mA/cm² to only 6 mA/cm². By using a step-cell design, in which the SiGe was partially etched to allow more light to reach the bottom cell, the current was increased to 20 mA/cm². To quantify the merits of the studied approach as well as evaluate other approaches, we have carried out a theoretical study of absorbed irradiance in a Si single-junction cell, a bonded GaAsP/Si tandem cell, a GaAsP/SiGe/Si tandem cell as well as the step-cell design. The GaAsP/Si bonded tandem cell showed 24% relative improvement in light absorption over a single-junction Si cell. The addition of a SiGe graded buffer was shown to reduce the total absorption by 25%, bringing the efficiency of GaAsP/SiGe/Si tandem cell under that of the Si single-junction cell. The step-cell design, even though successful in increasing light absorption, was not found effective in achieving a higher absorbed power density than that of the Si cell. These results suggest that any future work on integrating GaAsP cells on Si towards a high-performance tandem cell should be focused on using a higher-bandgap material as a graded buffer or using a wafer bonding technique.",

Important limits to the use of HOEs in the COIN system were identified and evaluated. In particular, the problem of changing wavelength between the hologram recording and readout steps was examined and it was shown that there is no general solution to this problem when the hologram to be recorded is constructed with more than two plane waves interfering with each other. Two experimental techniques, the holographic bead lens and holographic liftoff, were developed as partial workarounds to the identified limitations.

BMI research has largely focused on the problem of restoring the original motor function. The goal therefore has been to achieve a performance close to that of the healthy individual. There have been compelling proof of concept demonstrations of the utility of such BMIs in the past decade. However, performance of these systems needs to be significantly improved before they become clinically viable. Moreover, while developing high-performance BMIs with the goal of matching the original motor function is indeed valuable, a compelling goal is that of designing BMIs that can surpass original motor function. In this thesis, we first develop a novel real-time BMI for restoration of natural motor function. We then introduce a BMI architecture aimed at enhancing original motor function. We implement both our designs in rhesus monkeys. To facilitate the restoration of lost motor function, BMIs have focused on either estimating the continuous movement trajectory or target intent. However, natural movement often incorporates both. Moreover, both target and trajectory information are encoded in the motor cortical areas. These suggest that BMIs should be designed to combine these principal aspects of movement. We develop a novel two-stage BMI to decode jointly the target and trajectory of a reaching movement. First, we decode the intended target from neural spiking activity before movement initiation. Second, we combine the decoded target with the spiking activity during movement to estimate the trajectory. To do so, we use an optimal feedback-control design that aims to emulate the sensorimotor processing underlying actual motor control and directly processes the spiking activity using point process modeling in real time. We show that the two-stage BMI performs more accurately than either stage alone. Correct target prediction can compensate for inaccurate trajectory estimation and vice versa. This BMI also performs significantly better than linear regression approaches demonstrating the advantage of a design that more closely mimics the sensorimotor system.",

    "abstract": "Electrostatic interactions associated with aggrecan, one of the major components of the cartilage extracellular matrix, are responsible for ~50% of the equilibrium compressive elastic modulus of the tissue. The bottle-brush-shaped aggrecan consists of a core protein to which ~100 sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) chains are attached. Loss of sGAG is one early events in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis and the resulting degradation of cartilage is irreversible due to its limited capacity for self-repair. Tissue engineering is one of the techniques which holds great potential for cartilage repair. In order to achieve successful repair, a clear understanding of native and engineered cartilage aggrecan is essential. With atomic force microscopy and high resolution force microscopy, the structure of aggrecan single molecules and the nanomechanical properties of an end-grafted aggrecan monolayer were quantified. Adult human aggrecan showed significantly shorter GAG chains and core proteins as well as lower molecular stiffness compared to that of newborn aggrecan. After enzymatic digestion of chondroitin sulfate (CS) GAGs, keratan sulfate GAG chains were visualized near the N-terminal domain of a less extended core protein. Direct visualization of aggrecan aggregates confirmed the structure of the constituent hyaluronic acid, aggrecan G1 domain, and link protein. Increased flexibility of the core protein was found near the G1 domain, which may facilitate the aggregate self-assembly process. Aggregated and non-aggregated aggrecan both showed remarked flexibility (i.e., decreased extension ratio) when the aggrecan areal density increased. These findings on intra- and inter-molecular structure provide insights into the structure-property relationships of aggrecan in vivo. Aggrecan produced by animal-matched bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and chondrocytes seeded in peptide hydrogel were evaluated for their age-associated structure and nanomechanical properties. Independent of age, BMSCs produced longer core proteins and GAG chains than the chondrocytes, suggesting that the BMSC-produced aggrecan was characteristic of that from young cartilage. Comparison of the adult BMSC-produced aggrecan with adult cartilage-extracted aggrecan revealed that adult BMSC-aggrecan has a phenotype characteristic of young growth cartilage: primarily full-length aggrecan core, longer GAG chains and a higher content of chondroitin-4-sulfate in the CS-GAG chains, the latter identified via fluorescence assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis. The nanomechanical stiffness of BMSC-aggrecan was demonstrably greater than that of cartilage-aggrecan at the same total sGAG (fixed charge) density.

On the other hand, if a valve is flexibly controlled by a variable valve actuation (VVA) system, we can achieve significant improvements in fuel efficiency, engine performance, and emissions. One of the most advanced variable valve actuation systems is the VVA operated by an electromechanical actuator without a camshaft, the so-called bi-positional electromechanical valve drive (EMVD). Existing EMVDs characteristically use a spring to provide the required mechanical power for operating a valve. The use of a spring provides many benefits to the design of the system, but it also results in difficult design challenges. The large holding force against the spring at the ends of the stroke suggests the use of a normal-force electromagnetic actuator, which, from a servomechanical point of view, is considerably inferior to a shear-force actuator. Furthermore, the large holding force generates a large jerk at the beginning and the end of a stroke and makes it difficult to achieve soft valve landing. An innovative electromechanical valve drive (EMVD) design is proposed, which incorporates a nonlinear mechanical transformer and a shear-force actuator. This allows not only fast but also smooth valve motion, almost zero seating velocity, zero holding power, and improved control with acceptable electric power.

    "abstract": "For a long time, there has been a desire to extend the emission wavelength of GaAs-based quantum well lasers, with the aim of eventually replacing InP with GaAs as the substrate of choice for communication applications. Using dilute nitride GaInAsN QWs or InAs quantum dots, emission wavelengths have successfully been extended to 1.3 m, but significant difficulties have been met going beyond 1.3 m. In this thesis, we present an alternative approach, namely, the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of quantum wells on top of indium gallium arsenic compositionally graded buffers, with the indium composition in the buffers linearly graded from 0% to 15% or 20%. We observed that one can obtain strong quantum emission on top of such graded buffers only under a very restricted range of growth conditions, detailed in this thesis, which are not compatible with the subsequent growth of the aluminum-containing barriers necessary for carrier confinement. Furthermore, upon proper ex-situ annealing, it was able to obtain QW emission as strong as, sometimes even stronger than, that from QWs pseudomorphically grown on GaAs.However, when even slight tensile or compressive strain was added to the QWs, severe degradation occurred, which was likely related with the amount of surface roughness induced by the crosshatches developed during and after the growth of the graded buffers. Temperature dependent photoluminescence was employed as a tool to investigate the relationship between the ex-situ annealing, strain and quantum well photoluminescence. It was found that there was a significant PL decay mechanism between 50K to about 250K for the aluminum containing unannealed quantum well samples. For the unstrained ones, this mechanism could be removed effectively by annealing. However, strain in quantum well was observed to retard this removal. The same observations were made in both the pseudomorphically and metamorphically grown samples, but the metamorphic ones seemed to suffer more from the retardation.Finally, the theoretical modeling of the photoluminescence temperature dependence was reformulated such that physical processes or band diagram features could be related to the measurement results.

    "title": "Quantitative information-flow tracking for real systems",
    "abstract": "An information-flow security policy constrains a computer system's end-to-end use of information, even as it is transformed in computation. For instance, a policy would not just restrict what secret data could be revealed directly, but restrict any output that might allow inferences about the secret. Expressing such a policy quantitatively, in terms of a specific number of bits of information, is often an effective program independent way of distinguishing what scenarios should be allowed and disallowed. This thesis describes a family of new techniques for measuring how much information about a program's secret inputs is revealed by its public outputs on a particular execution, in order to check a quantitative policy on realistic systems. Our approach builds on dynamic tainting, tracking at runtime which bits might contain secret in formation, and also uses static control-flow regions to soundly account for implicit flows via branches and pointer operations. We introduce a new graph model that bounds information flow by the maximum flow between inputs and outputs in a flow network representation of an execution. The flow bounds obtained with maximum flow are much more precise than those based on tainting alone (which is equivalent to graph reachability).

    "text": "Quantitative information-flow tracking for real systems An information-flow security policy constrains a computer system's end-to-end use of information, even as it is transformed in computation. For instance, a policy would not just restrict what secret data could be revealed directly, but restrict any output that might allow inferences about the secret. Expressing such a policy quantitatively, in terms of a specific number of bits of information, is often an effective program independent way of distinguishing what scenarios should be allowed and disallowed. This thesis describes a family of new techniques for measuring how much information about a program's secret inputs is revealed by its public outputs on a particular execution, in order to check a quantitative policy on realistic systems. Our approach builds on dynamic tainting, tracking at runtime which bits might contain secret in formation, and also uses static control-flow regions to soundly account for implicit flows via branches and pointer operations. We introduce a new graph model that bounds information flow by the maximum flow between inputs and outputs in a flow network representation of an execution. The flow bounds obtained with maximum flow are much more precise than those based on tainting alone (which is equivalent to graph reachability). The bounds are a conservative estimate of channel capacity: the amount of information that could be transmitted by an adversary making an arbitrary choice of secret inputs.

    "abstract": "The spatio-temporal pattern in the auditory nerve (AN), i.e. the temporal pattern of AN fiber activity across the tonotopic axis, provides cues to important features in sounds such as pitch, loudness, and spatial location. These spatio-temporal cues may be extracted by central neurons in the cochlear nucleus (CN) that receive inputs from AN fibers innervating different cochlear regions and are sensitive to their relative timing. One possible mechanism for this extraction is cross-frequency coincidence detection (CD), in which a central neuron converts the degree of cross-frequency coincidence in the AN into a rate response by preferentially firing when its AN inputs across the tonotopic axis discharge in synchrony. We implemented a CD model receiving AN inputs from varying extents of the tonotopic axis, and compared responses of model CD cells with those of single units recorded in the CN of the anesthetized cat. We used Huffman stimuli, which have flat magnitude spectra and a single phase transition, to systematically manipulate the relative timing across AN fibers and to evaluate the sensitivity of model CD cells and CN units to the spatiotemporal pattern of AN discharges. Using a maximum likelihood approach, we found that certain unit types (primary-like-with-notch and some phase lockers) had responses consistent with cross-frequency CD cell. Some of these CN units provide input to neurons in a binaural circuit that process cues for sound localization and are sensitive to interaural level differences. A possible functional role of a cross-frequency CD mechanism in the CN is to increase the dynamic range of these binaural neurons. However, many other CN units had responses more consistent with AN fibers than with CD cells. We hypothesized that CN units resembling cross-frequency CD cells (as determined by their responses to Huffman stimuli) would convert spatio-temporal cues to pitch in the AN into rate cues that are robust with level. We found that, in response to harmonic complex tones, cross-frequency CD cells and some CN units (primary-like-with-notch and choppers) maintained robust rate cues at high levels compared to AN fibers, suggesting that at least some CN neurons extend the dynamic range of rate representations of pitch beyond that found in AN fibers. However, there was no obvious correlation between robust rate cues in individual CN units and similarity to cross-frequency CD cells as determined by responses to Huffman stimuli. It is likely that a model including more realistic inputs, membrane channels, and spiking mechanism, or other mechanisms such as lateral inhibition or spatial and temporal summation over spatially distributed inputs would provide insight into the neural mechanisms that give rise to the robust rate cues observed in some CN units.",

    "abstract": "This thesis is a study of erasures in cryptographic protocols. Erasing old data and keys is an important capability of honest parties in cryptographic protocols. It is useful in many settings, including proactive security in the presence of a mobile adversary, adaptive security in the presence of an adaptive adversary, forward security, and intrusion resilience. Some of these settings, such as achieving proactive security, is provably impossible without some form of erasures. Other settings, such as designing protocols that are secure against adaptive adversaries, are much simpler to achieve when erasures are allowed. Protocols for all these contexts typically assume the ability to perfectly erase information. Unfortunately, as amply demonstrated in the systems literature, perfect erasures are hard to implement in practice. We propose a model of imperfect or partial erasures where erasure instructions are only partially effective and leave almost all the data intact, thus giving the honest parties only a limited capability to dispose old data. Nonetheless, we show how to design protocols for all of the above settings (including proactive security, adaptive security, forward security, and intrusion resilience) for which this weak form of erasures suffices. We do not have to invent entirely new protocols, but rather show how to automatically modify protocols relying on perfect erasures into ones for which partial erasures suffices. Stated most generally, we provide a compiler that transforms any protocol relying on perfect erasures for security into one with the same functionality that remains secure even if the erasures are only partial. The key idea is a new redundant representation of secret data which can still be computed on, and yet is rendered useless when partially erased. We prove that any such compiler must incur a cost in additional storage, and that our compiler is near optimal in terms of its storage overhead. We also give computationally more efficient compilers for a number of special cases: (1) when all the computations on secrets can be done in constant parallel time (NC⁰); (2) for a class of proactive secret sharing protocols where we leave the protocol intact except for changing the representation of the shares of the secret and the instructions that modify the shares (to correspondingly modify the new representation instead).",

In a significant class of these systems the submillimeter-wave source, detector and device of interest are monolithically integrated. Such systems are attractive because of their reliability and small size and cost, because an integrated circuit is the highest-bandwidth environment for testing microelectronic devices, and because of their potential application to on-chip chemical and biological sensing. This thesis focuses on three separate topics in the field of submillimeter-wave spectroscopy with integrated circuits. The first topic is the decrease in bandwidth of photoconductive submillimeter wave emitters with increasing voltage bias, which limits the output power of these devices at frequencies near 1 THz. We performed measurements of a photoconductor made of low-temperature grown GaAs embedded in a coplanar waveguide with both static and dynamic illumination. We investigated the bandwidth decrease and an increase in de photocurrent that occurs at the same bias voltages. We attribute both phenomena to a reduction of the electron capture cross section of donor states due to electron heating and Coulomb-barrier lowering. The second topic is a novel circuit for ultrafast measurements with coplanar waveguide transmission lines. The circuit contains photoconductive switches that allow tunable generation and reception of a coplanar waveguide's two propagating modes. The circuit has fewer discontinuities than other circuits with similar capabilities and does not require air bridges. We show how the photoconductive switch can be biased to compensate for pump laser beam misalignment. The third topic is the first demonstration of an integrated circuit's use for submillimeter- wave frequency-domain spectroscopy. Such an application is attractive because of its inherently good frequency resolution, which is necessary for chemical and biological detection. The amplitude and phase of the measured spectrum of a circuit without a device under test agree with a model that takes into account circuit resonance, photoconductive-switch dynamics, and resistive loss.

A short pulse gyrotron based on the industrial tube design was built at MIT for experimental studies. The experiments are the first demonstration of such high powers at 110 GHz. Using a 96 kV, 40 A electron beam, over 1.4 MW was axially extracted in the design (TE22,6) mode in 3 us pulses, corresponding to a microwave efficiency of 37 %. The beam alpha, the ratio of transverse to axial velocity in the electron beam, was measured with a probe. At the high efficiency operating point the beam alpha was measured as 1.33. This value of alpha is less than the design value of 1.4, possibly accounting for the slightly reduced experimental efficiency. The output power and efficiency, as a function of magnetic field, beam voltage, and beam current, are in good agreement with nonlinear theory and simulations with the MAGY code. In another phase of the experiment, a second tube was built and tested. This tube used the same gun and cavity but also incorporated an internal mode converter to transform the generated waveguide mode into a free-space propagating beam. The gun was tested to full power and current in the experiment. Preliminary results were obtained. A mode map was generated to locate the region of operating parameters for the design mode, as well as for neighboring modes. Scans of the output microwave beam were also taken using a power-detecting diode. Future work will focus on generating high power, as well as operating the collector at a depressed voltage for even higher efficiency.

The beam alpha, the ratio of transverse to axial velocity in the electron beam, was measured with a probe. At the high efficiency operating point the beam alpha was measured as 1.33. This value of alpha is less than the design value of 1.4, possibly accounting for the slightly reduced experimental efficiency. The output power and efficiency, as a function of magnetic field, beam voltage, and beam current, are in good agreement with nonlinear theory and simulations with the MAGY code. In another phase of the experiment, a second tube was built and tested. This tube used the same gun and cavity but also incorporated an internal mode converter to transform the generated waveguide mode into a free-space propagating beam. The gun was tested to full power and current in the experiment. Preliminary results were obtained. A mode map was generated to locate the region of operating parameters for the design mode, as well as for neighboring modes. Scans of the output microwave beam were also taken using a power-detecting diode. Future work will focus on generating high power, as well as operating the collector at a depressed voltage for even higher efficiency. A study is also presented of the 96 kV, 40 A magnetron injection gun."

The focus of this thesis is on using computational methods that exploit structure in our universe to move past these obstacles and reveal the invisible. In this thesis, we focus on two imaging problems that explicitly leverage structure in our universe: reconstructing images and video from a computational telescope the size of the Earth, and seeing around corners. For the first imaging problem, this thesis investigates ways to reconstruct images and video from a sparse telescope array distributed around the globe. Additionally, it presents a number of evaluation techniques developed to rigorously evaluate imaging methods in order to establish confidence in reconstructions done with real scientific data. The methods and evaluation techniques developed in this thesis will hopefully aid in ongoing work to take the first picture of a black hole.

    "abstract": "This thesis considers stochastic methods for large-scale linear systems, variational inequalities, and convex optimization problems. I focus on special structures that lend themselves to sampling, such as when the linear/nonlinear mapping or the objective function is an expected value or is the sum of a large number of terms, and/or the constraint is the intersection of a large number of simpler sets. For linear systems, I propose modifications to deterministic methods to allow the use of random samples and maintain the stochastic convergence, which is particularly challenging when the unknown system is singular or nearly singular. For variational inequalities and optimization problems, I propose a class of methods that combine elements of incremental constraint projection, stochastic gradient/ subgradient descent, and proximal algorithm. These methods can be applied with various sampling schemes that are suitable for applications involving distributed implementation, large data set, or online learning. I use a unified framework to analyze the convergence and the rate of convergence of these methods. This framework is based on a pair of supermartingale bounds, which control the convergence to feasibility and the convergence to optimality, respectively, and are coupled at different time scales.",

However, no study has assessed the direct effects of these marketing actions on patient coping attitudes and behaviors. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate whether the mere presence of disease marketing impacts patient coping and if so, how do they affect patients' coping attitudes and behaviors. METHODS: We conducted a controlled experiment using online questionnaires to assess the disease perceptions, coping decisions and disease disclosure behaviors of 108 subjects. The subjects were divided into two groups where the experimental group (N = 55) was shown marketing actions associated with a fictitious disease called Karlsen's Disease while the control group (N = 53) was not shown any marketing actions. The subjects were then asked a series of questions related to health-related coping behaviors and non-health related social behaviors. T-tests and chi-square analyses were used to analyze the behavioral differences between the experimental (high-marketing) and control (no-marketing) groups. RESULTS: Subjects in the high-marketing group were overall significantly more willing to draft a will than subjects in the no-marketing group (t(106) = 2.64, p = 0.01); High-marketing group subjects were overall significantly more likely to wear a medical ID bracelet than no-marketing group subjects (c²(1, N = 108) = 3.71, p = 0.05); Among subjects who were willing to request a menu accommodation at a dinner party, those who were in the high-marketing group were significantly more likely to disclose their disease to the party host (c²(1, N = 90) = 4.65, p = 0.03); Subjects in the high-marketing group were also significantly more likely to anticipate greater understanding from the party host towards their menu accommodation request. When controlled for gender, women in the high-marketing group were more likely to join a patient support group (t(61) = 1.75, p = 0.09), and less likely to ask family and friends to shave their heads in show of solidarity (t(18) = -1.97, p = 0.07) than women in the no-marketing group; Men in the high-marketing group were more likely than men in the no-marketing group to disclose their health condition to the dinner party host (c²(1, N = 47) = 3.61, p = 0.06). Finally, among subjects with at least a 4-year college degree, those in the high-marketing group were more willing than those in the no-marketing group to wear a face mask to protect themselves from airborne pathogens in crowded public places (t(61) = 1.79, p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, the presence of disease marketing is anticipated to have a general positive impact on patient coping attitudes and behaviors. Chronically ill patients exposed to disease marketing actions are expected to anticipate less stigma from others, have increased willingness to disclose their illness and adopt health seeking behaviors. Disease marketing is also expected to have differential impact on patients based on their gender and level of education.

    "title": "Biomedical data retrieval utilizing textual data in a gene expression database by Richard Lu, MD.",
    "abstract": "Background: The commoditization of high-throughput gene expression sequencing and microarrays has led to a proliferation in both the amount of genomic and clinical data that is available. Descriptive textual information deposited with gene expression data in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) is an underutilized resource because the textual information is unstructured and difficult to query. Rendering this information in a structured format utilizing standard medical terms would facilitate better searching and data reuse. Such a procedure would significantly increase the clinical utility of biomedical data repositories. Methods: The thesis is divided into two sections. The first section compares how well four medical terminologies were able to represent textual information deposited in GEO. The second section implements free-text search and faceted search and evaluates how well they are able to answer clinical queries with varying levels of complexity. Part I: 120 samples were randomly extracted from samples deposited in the GEO database from six clinical domains-breast cancer, colon cancer, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), type I diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and asthma. These samples were previously annotated manually and structured textual information was obtained in a tag:value format. Data was mapped to four different controlled terminologies: NCI Thesaurus, MeSH, SNOMED-CT, and ICD- 10. The samples were assigned a score on a three-point scale that was based on how well the terminology was able to represent descriptive textual information. Part II: Faceted and free-text search tools were implemented, with 300 GEO samples included for querying. Eight natural language search questions were selected randomly from scientific journals. Academic researchers were recruited and asked to use the faceted and free-text search tools to locate samples matching the question criteria. Precision, recall, F-score, and search time were compared and analyzed for both free-text and faceted search. Results: The results show that the NCI Thesaurus consistently ranked as the most comprehensive terminology across all domains while ICD-10 consistently ranked as the least comprehensive. Using NCI Thesaurus to augment the faceted search tool, each researcher was able to reach 100% precision and recall (F-score 1.0) for each of the eight search questions. Using free-text search, test users averaged 22.8% precision, 60.7% recall, and an F-score of 0.282. The mean search time per question using faceted search and free-text search were 116.7 seconds, and 138.4 seconds, respectively. The difference between search time was not statistically significant (p=0. 734). However, paired t-test analysis showed a statistically signficant difference between the two search strategies with respect to precision (p=O.001), recall (p=O.042), and F-score (p<0. 001). Conclusion: This work demonstrates that biomedical terms included in a gene expression database can be adequately expressed using the NCI Thesaurus. It also shows that faceted searching using a controlled terminology is superior to conventional free-text searching when answering queries of varying levels of complexity.",

    "abstract": "Medicare coverage policies of medical procedures can be promulgated at a national level by the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as National Coverage Determinations (NCDs) or at a local level by Medicare contractors as Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs). Although LCDs shouldn't contradict NCDs, they can differ. In the present study, I analyze some factors that could partially account for the differences between NCDs and LCDs. Using the Medicare Coverage Database from CMS, I searched for differences between NCDs and LCDs in five benefit categories: inpatient hospital services, durable medical devices, diagnostic laboratory tests, physician's services and other diagnostic tests. There is a reasonable degree of homogeneity in coverage policies for procedures for which an NCD has been issued: 82% are exactly the same. Most of the differences took the form of exclusions from LCDs, but not from NCDs. For each state, I computed the number of times that LCDs were issued and the number of times that LCDs differed from NCDs and searched for possible linear or exponential correlation models. The following factors were initially hypothesized to account for these differences: number of Schools of Medicine, number of physicians, GDP per capita by state, state ranking according to number of Level 1 and Level 2 Trauma Centers and the profile of MEDCAC members. At a national level, I found no correlation between the number of LCDs issued or the number of differences between LCDs and NCDs and any of these variables. However, on a sub-analysis at a local level, in some regions I found a positive correlation (r2 >.94) between the following three variables: 1) number of Schools of Medicine, 2) number of physicians, and 3) state ranking according to the number of Level 1 and Level 2 Trauma Centers and the following two parameters: 1) the level of LCD issuing activity, and 2) the number of times that LCDs differ from NCDs. The correlations shown by the performed sub-analysis within regions may imply that more LCDs are issued to restrict coverage when there is a local need to control the excessive demand partially driven by the higher number of hospitals and physicians that are active in pursuing their interests. The fact that these correlations were shown only at a regional level may indicate that when local factors are disregarded, the original hypothesized factors do influence LCD activity, however, at a national level, other hypothetical local factors may have a greater influence on LCD activity and policy discrepancies. In order to have a better understanding of my results and the factors that could account for the differences between NCDs and LCDs, I interviewed four Contractor Medical Directors (CMDs). These interviews indicated that other factors could account for these differences, including the following: a history of abuse and fraud, contractor's budgets, the CMD's special interests and experience, data analysis capabilities, the number of claims and the novelty of the procedure. The impact of these variables on the differences between national and local coverage policies can be an interesting topic for future research on the subject.",

We gathered data on acquisitions of 237 companies over the past ten years, from April 01, 2002 to March 31, 2011. These data were gathered from various sources, and information on the date of acquisition, enterprise value, funds invested to date, date of incorporation, status and dates of CE and FDA approvals, patent status, type of regulatory clearances (PMA versus 510K), type of sales models (direct versus distributorship), capitalization status and last twelve month stock returns of the acquirer was acquired. These data were then analyzed using basic statistical methods and multivariate linear regression analyses to determine the significance of the CE marking on the outcomes of these companies. Our results support the claim that the CE mark does significantly improve outcomes for early stage medical device companies, in terms of time to strategic acquisition, which is by far the commonest exit route for these companies. On the other hand, we did not find any statistically significant impact of acquisition of the CE mark on the valuation or valuation multiples of these companies. These results have potential implications for management of these early stage medical device companies in making strategic decisions and for investors who are concerned about the exit opportunities and valuations, especially as it relates to funds invested.

However, the pattern and uptake of beneficial features of health IT is poorly understood, and is an important part of realizing the full benefits of health IT. This thesis examines the factors relating to adoption and use of reporting features within an outpatient practice management system. A retrospective observational study was performed utilizing web log data from a practice management and electronic health record system vendor. Two years of data were analyzed on the use of features within the system in two different scenarios: the use of a newly released custom reporting feature among existing clients, and the use of a physician-level monthly report among new clients. Among these two different populations and features, the first use and subsequent utilization exhibited similar patterns. Using the Bass model of technology diffusion to quantify the adoption of these features, it was found that adoption had a low social component (coefficient of imitation) and a high personal component (coefficient of innovation). One physician's use of a feature in his practice did not appear to influence whether a new physician joining the same practice would use the feature. In addition, the earliest users of a feature tended to utilize that feature more often.

    "abstract": "Disruptive models of innovation are starting to appear in healthcare. In the US, for instance, retail medicine clinics are changing the way in which patients satisfy their basic medical needs. In Mexico, similar retail medicine models (e.g. Farmacias Similares) are also disrupting healthcare delivery for basic medical needs. Disruptive innovations, however, are not limited to healthcare delivery, but also change the face of devices and diagnostics markets. A low CD4+ T cell count is the primary clinical indicator for HIV/AIDS disease progression, and thus is used as the primary trigger to initiate antiretroviral therapy. An entire diagnostic industry has emerged around CD4+ T cell counts for the management and treatment of HIV/AIDS patients. The diagnostic gold standards of CD4+ counts are flow cytometers. These large, capital intensive devices are commonly located in central laboratory settings, typically in urban areas. In developing nations, particularly, suburban and rural regions have no access to flow cytometers and typically face logistical problems of blood sample transportation and loss to follow-up of patients. Point-of-Care (POC) diagnostics promise disruptive models in diagnostics that will increase access, enhance care, and help better allocate healthcare resources. The concept of POC embodies the trade-off of lower \"quality\" (usually in the form of lower specificity and sensitivity) in exchange for higher \"convenience\" (i.e. better accessibility and portability, and significantly lower cost). POC diagnostics promise typical low-end and new-market disruptions in medical diagnostics and devices. Cambridge-based Daktari Diagnostics is one of such companies focused in POC diagnostics. It has developed a CD4+ T cell count diagnostic device for the management and treatment of HIV/AIDS patients. It is hypothesized in this thesis that there exists a relevant unmet medical need for POC CD4 count diagnostics in the Mexican HIV/AIDS market. In order to evaluate this hypothesis, secondary sources were reviewed, as well as primary interviews conducted across the Mexican HIV/AIDS healthcare landscape. While this hypothesis was evaluated on a preliminary basis only, responses suggested a relevant, albeit not urgent, medical need for POC CD4 count diagnostics. This primary hypothesis evaluation is extended by and complemented with market size estimations, and competitive dynamic discussions, that arrive at the following preliminary conclusions: the current market opportunity in Mexico ranges from baseline of ~100,000 tests per year to an upper bound potential of ~200,000 tests per year. In the context of this potential opportunity, Daktari's CD4 count diagnostic device is well positioned, as defined by diagnostic quality, technological characteristics, and competitive offering, to obtain a portion of this estimated market opportunity in Mexico.",

To address this limitation, we developed a scalable, all-organic 3D microelectrode array technology. The cheap, disposable arrays would be integrated into a fixed stimulation and imaging setup, potentially amenable to automated handling and data analysis. A combination of activity-dependent plasticity, made possible by independent control of up to 64 stimulating electrodes, and, eventually, of substrate chemical patterning would be employed to constrain the neuronal culture network connectivity. In order to ensure longterm survival of the cultures, a bottom feeder layer of glial cells would be grown. In addition to high-throughput screening application, the polymeric microelectrode arrays and integrated stimulation systems were designed to allow the long-term study of synaptic plasticity, combining excellent long-term culture capabilities with a unique ability to independently control each electrode stimulation pattern. The resulting activity could be monitored optically, e,g, with calcium or voltage sensitive dyes, and the images could be stored and processed (possibly even in real time) within the same environment (LabView) as the stimulator. To fabricate the polymeric microelectrode array, we prepare a multilayered mask substrate, by reversibly bonding together two sheets of implant-grade polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sheets, with or without a glass coverslip between them.

    "abstract": "For this project, N-terminal and C-terminal peptide library fusions were designed,bconstructed, and screened in order to improve the repression achievable with a novel gene regulatory system. This system, based on the interaction between proteins and proteinbinding RNA aptamers, takes advantage of the reversible interaction between TetR and its RNA aptamer binding partner 5-1.2 to modulate gene expression. With no tetracyclines present, TetR preferentially binds to aptamer 5-1.2 in the mRNA of a gene of interest with low nanomolar affinity and represses translation. Tetracyclines such as aTc induce a conformation change in TetR, prevent TetR binding to aptamer 5-1.2, and induce gene expression. Therefore, TetR binds aptamer 5-1.2 in an aTc-dependent manner, allowing inducible control of gene expression through the TetR-aptamer system. Initial characterization showed a regulatory range of 78% or approximately 5 fold in S. cerevisiae. The aim of this project is to improve repression levels achievable with the TetR-aptamer system by creating libraries of N-terminal and C-terminal peptide fusions to TetR and screening for increased repression in S. cerevisiae. The N-terminal and C-terminal library fusions were constructed from synthesized oligonucleotide fragments and a baseline TetR vector containing library insertions sites at both the N-terminal and C-terminal ends. The library fragments contain 20 random amino acids and a standard SSG linker peptide flanked by both single-cutting restriction enzyme sites and 40 bases of homology to the library insertion sites on the baseline TetR vector, allowing for construction by both restriction/ligation cloning in bacteria and yeast homologous recombination. Both libraries were constructed using restriction/ligation cloning after initial experiments determined optimized conditions for PCR, digest, purification, ligation, and electrocompetent bacterial transformation to achieve a maximum efficiency, fidelity, and purity. The N-terminal and C-terminal libraries produced have a combined diversity of 2.5x 105 variants. These library variants were screened using a plate-based assay with URA3 as a reporter gene. A selection with 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) was performed to identify library variants with improved repression. Since 5-FOA is a competitive inhibitor of URA3, cells that have URA3 expression cannot live on media containing 5-FOA. Preliminary experiments determined that 0.035% 5-FOA is the threshold for growth for the baseline",

    "abstract": "The pars tensa of the tympanic membrane is composed of three layers: an epidermal layer, a fibrous layer, and a mucosal layer. Recent studies (Kuijpers et al, 1999; Henson and Henson, 2000; Henson et al, 2005) suggest that the fibrous layer in several mammalian species contains contractile fibers, which are located primarily within the thickened border of the pars tensa known as the annulus fibrosis. These contractile fibers resemble smooth muscle fibers. Yang and Henson (2002) studied the physiological effects of pharmacological modulators on the pars tensa of the annulus fibrosis by measuring the sound-induced cochlear response. Their results suggest a dose-dependent change in cochlear response after application of sodium orthovanadate and norepinephrine. Application of saline induced no change in cochlear response. Based on their data, Yang and Henson proposed that the pharmacological agents altered the function of the smooth muscle fibers of the annulus fibrosis to produce a mechanical change in the tympanic membrane. In this study two measurements, cochlear response and Laser Doppler Vibrometry, were used to assess the sound-induced velocity of the tympanic membrane of the gerbil before and after application of saline and varying concentrations of three smooth muscle antagonists (sodium orthovanadate, norepinephrine, and carbachol) to the pars tensa. It was demonstrated that applications of saline and varying concentrations of sodium orthovanadate were associated with both increases and decreases in the magnitude of the cochlear response in two out of three ears tested. There was no evidence of a dose-dependent change in the cochlear response.",

Recent studies (Kuijpers et al, 1999; Henson and Henson, 2000; Henson et al, 2005) suggest that the fibrous layer in several mammalian species contains contractile fibers, which are located primarily within the thickened border of the pars tensa known as the annulus fibrosis. These contractile fibers resemble smooth muscle fibers. Yang and Henson (2002) studied the physiological effects of pharmacological modulators on the pars tensa of the annulus fibrosis by measuring the sound-induced cochlear response. Their results suggest a dose-dependent change in cochlear response after application of sodium orthovanadate and norepinephrine. Application of saline induced no change in cochlear response. Based on their data, Yang and Henson proposed that the pharmacological agents altered the function of the smooth muscle fibers of the annulus fibrosis to produce a mechanical change in the tympanic membrane. In this study two measurements, cochlear response and Laser Doppler Vibrometry, were used to assess the sound-induced velocity of the tympanic membrane of the gerbil before and after application of saline and varying concentrations of three smooth muscle antagonists (sodium orthovanadate, norepinephrine, and carbachol) to the pars tensa. It was demonstrated that applications of saline and varying concentrations of sodium orthovanadate were associated with both increases and decreases in the magnitude of the cochlear response in two out of three ears tested. There was no evidence of a dose-dependent change in the cochlear response."

    "title": "Can the phased array stimulation strategy be implemented using the advanced bionics cochlear implant?",
    "abstract": "Cochlear implants are devices that aim to restore a measure of hearing to the deaf by converting acoustic signals to electric stimuli delivered to electrodes implanted in the inner ear. Theoretically, the phased array stimulation strategy described by van den Honert and Kelsall (2007) provides much better control over the neural excitation patters elicited by electric stimulation by taking advantage of potential field superposition in the implanted cochlea, to construct stimuli for optimally selective excitation of auditory nerve fibers. If the phased array strategy can be implemented using a commonly-implanted commercial cochlear implant system, the strategy could be effectively evaluated in a relatively large sample of patients to determine whether it provides better speech reception than currently available systems. This thesis investigates whether the phased array strategy can be implemented using the Advanced Bionics Clarion CH or HiRes90k cochlear implant. It is shown that for realistic cochlear implant electrode impedance magnitudes, the Advanced Bionics cochlear implant current sources will deliver monopolar current suitable for the necessary measurement of transimpedance with less than 7% error. Transimpedance matrix estimates were obtained in 11 ears in 10 cochlear implant subjects. Measurements reveal that in some test subjects, low impedance current paths exist between implanted electrodes that may cause current leakage through unintended electrodes. Researchers and clinicians should consider using this transimpedance matrix estimation technique to screen for patients or research subjects who could benefit from compensatory changes to their speech processors. The results of this thesis suggest that the phased array strategy can be implemented successfully when the limitations of the internal power supply documented in this document are taken into account. It is recommended that the transimpedance matrix in a given test subject be measured on the day of any psychophysical testing because of the potential impact of variability in transimpedance over time.",

    "abstract": "It has been estimated that 100 million plus individuals could perish if a virulent influenza pandemic were to occur. In wake of the 2009-10 H1N1 pandemic and in an era of economic austerity, however, industry lacks clear incentives to invest in vaccines for other high-risk strains. The cyclic nature of pandemics also means we can expect another influenza pandemic within the next 20 years. In this environment, design of incentive mechanisms for funding development of vaccines against strains with known pandemic potential, but for whom vaccine technology is currently lacking, would be welcomed. This research explores which novel incentive mechanisms could induce investment in and development of processes for production of vaccines for these high risk strains. Interviews with vaccine developers and funding agencies and analysis of the pipeline of influenza vaccines in development were conducted. This thesis finds that there is a dearth of vaccines against influenza strains of known pandemic potential, such as H2, H7 and H9; that current pandemic preparedness efforts are not focused on these strains; that funding for pandemic preparedness efforts in H2, H7 and H9 would help incentivize development of vaccines against these strains; and that support for seasonal influenza, regulatory changes, alignment of public and private sector goals, and increased vaccine acceptance are also required to incentivize the development of vaccines against strains of known pandemic potential such as H2, H7 and H9. Furthermore, this thesis recommends that policy makers increase funding for pandemic preparedness so that programs may be initiated or expanded to include additional high risk influenza strains; that US and EU regulatory regimes for pandemic influenza vaccines be harmonized; and that governments promote public awareness of the importance of influenza vaccination.",

    "title": "The Disque Platform for the investigation of islet differentiation to study, treat, and cure Type 1 Diabetes",
    "abstract": "There is a critical health care need to generate large numbers of beta cells for transplantation. In Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), insulin-producing beta cells in the islets of Langerhans within the pancreas, which support glucose homeostasis, are destroyed in an autoimmune attack. The ensuing loss of glycemic control leads to serious complications, requiring life-long insulin injections and close monitoring, while shortening lifespan by 11-13 years. In the face of a three percent annual increase in T1D incidence, there is a grave lack of transplantable material, and very few patients are able to receive an islet transplant each year. Recent advances in stem cell differentiation have enabled the production of large quantities of insulin-producing beta-like cells in vitro, bringing hope to the field. However, the efficiency and yield of such production methods remains unacceptably low, with high batch-to-batch variability, and the function of these cells is unstable. Moreover, the ability to probe the conditions that affect differentiation outcomes is limited by the scale, cost, and complexity of existing culture systems. The present work focuses on the Disque Platform, a biomimetic screening platform for the investigation of islet cell differentiation. The Disque Platform allows for the formation of differentiating 3D micro-tissues within an automation-friendly design, and is capable of systematically manipulating the developing stem cell niche in order to identify chemical and physical cues that enhance beta cell production. Significantly, the Disque Platform consistently differentiates beta-like cells from pancreatic progenitor cells, with similar efficacy to existing high-volume production methods. Furthermore, it achieves superior differentiation outcomes compared to the 2D culture systems tested, and is able to respond to interventions when conventional systems cannot produce a clear signal or readout. Together, these data support the ability of the Disque Platform to investigate specific interventions to enhance beta-cell differentiation. It is hoped that the Disque Platform can serve as a springboard for beta cell and islet study within the diabetes community, and that these advances can contribute towards a cure for Type 1 Diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by many behavioral symptoms, including delays in social and communicative development. A cluster of symptoms concentrate on speech and language development, especially manipulation of non-verbal information conveyed in prosody. It is largely unknown whether this is due to functional or structural differences in the brain regions involved in auditory and speech processing, although recent studies have shown that ASD individuals do exhibit different activation patterns in various brain regions in response to speech stimuli. This study investigated responses in regions of the auditory pathway to short recorded and synthesized vowel stimuli. These regions were the Inferior Colliculus, the Left Thalamus, the left Posterior Insula, the Auditory Cortex, Wernicke's area, and Broca's area. The stimuli were parametrized so as to target different signal processing capabilities associated with each region. They were presented to ASD and typically developing (TD) subjects while the salient regions were subject to a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The results suggest that there were not gross differences in how ASD individuals responded from TD individuals in the subcortical regions. Results from the Auditory Cortex, however, showed a significant hemisphere dominance in TD subjects with more temporally complex stimuli that did not appear in ASD subjects. Moreover, the results showed that it was temporally-measured periodicities in the signal that were responsible for this difference. The results also show slightly different activation patterns in cortical regions which could have implications for attentiveness, and semantic and emotional processing. These results suggest that deficiencies in the temporal processing capabilities of the left Auditory Cortex play a major role in ASD speech processing.",

    "abstract": "Access to the cerebral ventricle (e.g. ventriculostomy) is required to manage multiple life-threatening ailments. It can be done either in the operating room or at the bedside to relieve increased intracranial pressure or deliver medication. At the bedside, the procedure is normally performed freehand, with the occasional use of a Ghajar guide for guidance support. In the operating room, ventriculostomy may be performed with an image-guidance system, whether optical or electromagnetic. The most common complications of ventriculostomy are hemorrhage and infection. It is unclear whether catheter placement accuracy and the number of passes of the catheter for each placement are correlated with ventriculostomy complications. Our goals are 1) to evaluate the current state of practice, including complications of ventriculostomy, and 2) to evaluate a targeted image guidance system for use with ventriculostomy - the Smart Stylet. To address these goals, an Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted at the Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) to characterize the practice of external ventricular drain placements using data from the patient electronic medical record. Post-procedure catheter location was measured on post-procedure CT and MRI imaging studies. Most cases were performed in the operating room and the operative reports provided all procedure-related information. Microbiology reports were collected within a four-week interval following catheter placements to evaluate presence of invading pathogens. All imaging studies, microbiology reports, and operative reports were reviewed manually. The rest of the medical records were not reviewed and, therefore, cerebrospinal fluid leak and shunt malfunction were not evaluated. Catheter placement accuracy and the numbers of passes for each placement were assessed. We evaluated whether these metrics were associated with the occurrence of procedure complications. A procedure-targeted image guidance system in development stage, the Smart Stylet, was implemented for use on a ventricular phantom model with a right-sided midline shift. Smart Stylet consists of an electromagnetic tracking system and ventriculostomy catheter connected to a PC and display. The operator of the Smart Stylet can interface with the system via a custom designed module in BWH's 3DSlicer software system. The system was tested for accuracy by calculating targeting error and reporting the precision of catheter placement. Precision was measured using pair-wise distances among experimental groups. The system was reviewed and commented on by three novices and two neurosurgical residents from the Massachusetts General Hospital by using the NASA-TLX grading scale questionnaire and a targeted survey. The phantom model was designed to gauge whether further tests in animals and cadavers are warranted using Smart Stylet. Patients with trauma were more likely to have catheters misplaced (OR = 9.13±2.31; p<0.05). It seems there is an opportunity to improve patient care if catheter placement is made more accurate and reliable. Use of the Smart Stylet system in a phantom study provided improvements in mean pair-wise distance and accuracy for catheter placement at the sub-centimeter level. A blinded operator achieved statistically significant improvement in targeting error using the right frontal approach (p<0.0 5). The operator also significantly improved mean pairwise distances using left and right frontal approaches (p<0.05). Novice operators and neurosurgical residents both showed improvements in targeting accuracy for catheter placement when using the system for the first time. However, the improvements were not statistically significant. Novices' pair-wise distances were significantly better with Smart Stylet guidance using the left frontal approach (p<0.05).

I conducted an extensive review of the scientific literature to identify the limitations of the current monitoring technologies and to understand the challenges of diagnosing and treating shock. To supplement my research, I interviewed clinicians who treat shock patients and scientists who are trying to develop new shock monitoring technologies. The clinicians confirmed that there is a critical need for improved shock monitoring technologies.

However, from various reports in the literature and the FDA site, it appears that only a small fraction of these approvals (four to six) have been converted into regular approvals, based on the demonstration of clinical benefit in the post-marketing studies that support the benefit seen in the pivotal studies."

    "title": "Assessing the impact of tumor evolution on oncology drug development and commercialization",
    "abstract": "This thesis investigates the commercial viability of developing and commercializing targeted oncology drugs directed at a specific tumor mutation instead of all forms and mutations of a single target. While oncologic drugs targeted to aberrant or overexpressed pro-proliferative proteins have revolutionized cancer treatment, tumors treated for long periods may mutate over time, gain resistance to these drugs and proliferate rapidly again. I hypothesize that drugs developed to inhibit specific resistant tumor genotypes can be commercially viable from a pharmaceutical manufacturer's perspective. To assess this hypothesis empirically, I construct a patient flow model in order to quantify the treatment of CML, a relatively rare and indolent hematological malignancy with extensive clinical data available and well-delineated disease phases and response criteria. To represent the rate of diagnosis, patients are \"added\" to the model every month, and thereafter there is a probability that a patient may either 1) become sufficiently intolerant to his drug in order to discontinue treatment, 2) fail to respond to treatment but remain in the same disease phase, 3) fail to respond to treatment and progress to the next phase of disease, or 4) adequately respond to treatment and stay on the same drug in the same phase. Patients that fail to respond (categories 2 and 3 above) have a chance of manifesting a resistance mutation that is adequately controlled by a hypothetical drug (in addition to their current treatment) but is otherwise untreatable. The aim of this analysis is to track the number of patients that accrue the chosen resistance mutation and thus would be good candidates to receive the hypothetical drug. Patient treatment rates are converted to sales figures, and are weighed against clinical development costs, timelines, and probabilities to determine the net present value (NPV) of a project to develop the hypothetical drug. In addition, parameters are varied in order to conduct a sensitivity analysis and determine the \"boundary conditions\" that make a drug profitable or unprofitable. To supplement the model results and confirm the model dynamics, I interviewed investment analysts, clinical oncology thoughtleaders, academic cancer researchers and clinical, commercial and regulatory personnel from drug manufacturers to gauge their opinions on the CML market and the hurdles particular to developing drugs aimed at resistant genotypes. The conclusion I reach from this analysis is that development of a specific mutation-directed therapy for resistant CML is unlikely to be profitable. Given the significantly smaller patient population, favorable conditions in pricing and clinical development would be required to make the hypothetical candidate even marginally profitable.",

    "abstract": "Interviews were conducted to establish a baseline for how orphan drug forecasting is currently undertaken by financial market and industry analysts with the intention of understanding the variables typically accounted for in such a model. A literature search formed the basis of subsequent interviews conducted with experts from industry, payers, providers, legislators, patient groups, and the FDA. Discussion then focused on elements of the market which are poised to change in the short-term, how such changes might be reflected in existing models, and/or how these models may instead need to be modified to adapt to the new environment. We hypothesized that impending changes in the healthcare sector would indeed impact the legitimacy of current forecasting models, and that significant changes would need to be introduced to account for these new market forces. Our hypothesis, however, was not confirmed, in that although much of the literature and, indeed, public outcry over rising healthcare costs in general and drug prices in particular make a strong case for implementing changes in the orphan market via payers, government, or other actors, an assessment of healthcare experts regarding market changes over the next five years revealed a general consensus that meaningful change will likely not occur during this timeframe for orphan products, with the exception of a possible increase in pharmacoeconomic requirements for drugs which are only marginally effective. Thus, current orphan drug forecasting models constructed for use by financial and industry analysts correctly avoid discounting for these potential changes, as they will likely not face significant changes in the US until closer to a ten year time horizon. Potential exceptions to this conclusion depend on implementation and regulatory treatment of the fields of personalized medicine and gene therapy, as developments in these areas may closely interact with existing orphan drug legislation.

    "abstract": "Targeted, especially stratified or biomarker-guided, therapies offer significant advantages over traditional oncology therapies in certain settings. Selecting patients most likely to respond to a drug increases the therapeutic efficacy while reducing toxicities and may accelerate regulatory approval since smaller clinical trials are needed to demonstrate benefit. Several drugs, including vemurafenib and crizotinib have demonstrated these benefits along with commercial success. However, significant risk exists for the drug developer since approval may be threatened if they fail to meet unclear and differing yet parallel requirements for both the drug and the required companion diagnostic. Tumor biology is also increasingly complex since recent studies suggest that there are limited numbers of individual driver mutations, complicated interactions throughout signaling pathways as well as extensive tumor heterogeneity, all of which will challenge the effectiveness of targeted therapies. Clinical trial strategy decisions can greatly impact the success of a targeted therapy due to these challenges. While therapeutic efficacy is considered important, biomarker prevalence and companion diagnostic performance have been shown to be as important, yet more informative at the time decisions are made. I hypothesized that common prevalence and companion diagnostic performance thresholds are being used to guide biomarker-guided clinical trial strategy decisions for targeted oncology therapies. Seventeen interviews with preclinical, clinical or translational leads were conducted across a focused set of ten \"pathway-modifying\" cancer drug programs (CDK4/6, MDM2 and P13KP inhibitors) that reflect the biological complexity of future targeted therapies. These interviews provided empirical data as to how biomarkers are being incorporated into current clinical trial decisions. All respondents were planning to use a companion diagnostic for their program, however, the use of biomarkers varied significantly. For those programs with ongoing clinical trials in phase I and II, 54% (n=7/13) were pursuing a biomarker-guided strategy while 46% (n=6/13) were using an initial all-comers strategy. This fairly equal split separated when compared by phase where trials in phase I and 1/11, 60% (n=6/10) were using an all-comers strategy but for those trials in phase II (n=3), all were using biomarker-guided strategies. A key finding of the interviews was that 66.7% (n=4/6) were planning biomarker enrichment as part of expansion plans. Disproving my hypothesis, however, common thresholds for neither biomarker prevalence nor companion diagnostic performance were being used to guide these decisions. Biomarker prevalences of 50-100% were stated as potentially appropriate for an all-comers strategy. Companion diagnostic performance thresholds were even less influential as only a few respondents provided a general range of desired sensitivity and specificity.

Ultimately, the valley of death reflects the perceived imbalance of risk and reward for an investment at this stage as well as the resulting difficulty for a biotech company in raising capital during this time. For companies focused on a neglected disease, this risk/reward profile is even more skewed, with significantly greater market risks and fewer exit opportunities for an investor. As a result, the \"valley of death\" phenomenon for a global health company developing a therapeutic for a neglected disease is even more pronounced As a result, private sector funding for translational research of neglected disease therapeutics has beeri severely lacking.

    "abstract": "Over the past ten years there has been increasing public concern regarding the rising costs of pharmaceuticals. Drug expenditure is the fastest growing sector of healthcare costs in the United States. The structure of the U.S. healthcare system allows pharmaceutical companies to freely price their drugs. Then payers decide whether and how to cover these drugs. Payers have at their disposal several utilization management tools, such as tiering and prior authorizations, to steer their members to less costly drugs. However, the ability of payers to implement these tools varies significantly depending on whether the drug is covered under the pharmaceutical benefit / Medicare Part D provisions of healthcare plans or the medical benefit / Medicare Part B provisions. Drugs covered under the pharmaceutical benefit / Part D are distributed via retail pharmacies and, in general, are oral pills. Drugs covered under the medical benefit / Part B are physician administered drugs and, in general, are injectables or intravenous drugs. As pharmaceutical companies increasingly price their drugs at higher and higher levels, payers must take a drug's pricing into account when determining how to cover these drugs. This thesis assesses the role pricing plays in how a drug is covered. Two different classes of drugs were chosen to examine this topic: fixed dose combination (FDC) cardiovascular drugs and intravenous oncologies. FDC cardiovascular drugs were chosen because they are covered under the pharmacy benefit / Part D and are considered to have questionable efficacious value over their individual drug components. Intravenous oncologies were chosen because they are covered under the medical benefit / Part B and represent a highly politicized therapy area. These two therapy areas are illustrative of strongly contrasting classes of drugs. Literature review and public sources were used to obtain prices for the select cardiovascular FDCs and oncologies. Medicare's Formulary Finder was used to obtain the coverage level for the cardiovascular FDCs. This preliminary information showed that the most expensive of the select FDCs, Caduet, has the worst coverage. The literature review suggested that Provenge and Avastin, the most expensive of the select oncologies, had difficulty obtaining coverage. To confirm these results, interviews were conducted with a variety of payers. These interviews focused on what factors went into the coverage decision-making process for cardiovascular FDCs and intravenous oncologies. Interviews were also conducted with an oncologic distributor to determine distributors' impact on price. We hypothesized that price was the driving reason for Caduet's, Provenge's, and Avastin's relatively poor coverage. However, our hypothesis was not entirely confirmed. Payers confirmed that price and contracting were the driving factors for Caduet's relatively poor coverage, but they indicated that the situation was not as simple for the intravenous oncologies. Although price does play a small role in the coverage decision-making process for intravenous oncologies, other factors such as public policies and the unmet need in the therapy area drive coverage decisions more than price. Additionally, payers indicated that they lack the ability to steer members to less costly intravenous oncologies due to the drug acquisition and reimbursement structure of the medical benefit. Consequently, payers are beginning to utilize new techniques such as specialty pharmacies to help control utilization of these products. Also, other organizations such as certain oncologic distributors are attempting to implement cost-effective guidelines for intravenous oncologies. Our results have significant implications for what pharmaceutical companies should be considering when pricing their drugs, and highlight the pricing and coverage issues in the current healthcare system's structure that payers and other organizations are facing.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this research is to investigate potential strategic variables that executives at small to mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies should consider during the period of a drug launch. Bringing a product to market is a critical event for any biopharmaceutical company. It marks a major turning point within the biopharmaceutical's lifecycle and the company that can successfully launch a product will be viewed as a different asset class. Therefore, it is critical to understand potential drivers of the value and to encourage executives to raise probing questions when they are considering the next round of financing or whether to provide guidance. This study analyzed forty-six non-generic, therapeutic drugs launched in the US during January 2000- December 2009 by small to mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies with market capitalizations less than $20 billion at the time of launch. Predictor variables that were initially considered in the analysis are the following: management providing a sales guidance (binary), partnership (binary), market size of the partner(s) at the time of launch, specialty/primary care indication (binary), difference between year two actual sales number and that of pre-launch estimate, difference between year two actual sales number and that of post-launch estimate, financing activity prior to launch (binary), financing activity after launch (binary), average prelaunch file-to-offer discount, average post-launch file-to-offer discount, number of drugs launched by the same company (control variable) and NBI performance (control variable). Multiple linear regression analyses were then performed to determine which of these parameters were predictive of changes in stock price and changes in market capitalization. Those companies that did not provide guidance at the time of launch and raised additional capital within two years after launch performed better than those that did otherwise. Neither a partnership nor the market size of the partner contributed to either of the outcome measures. Whether or not the product is a specialty product also did not make any significant contribution to the models. The results from this study suggest several possible strategic and actionable items that can guide management to ask the right questions during the period around a drug launch.",

    "text": "Understanding the drivers of value creation for biopharmaceuticals around the time of drug launch The purpose of this research is to investigate potential strategic variables that executives at small to mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies should consider during the period of a drug launch. Bringing a product to market is a critical event for any biopharmaceutical company. It marks a major turning point within the biopharmaceutical's lifecycle and the company that can successfully launch a product will be viewed as a different asset class. Therefore, it is critical to understand potential drivers of the value and to encourage executives to raise probing questions when they are considering the next round of financing or whether to provide guidance.

    "abstract": "Published findings report that it takes approximately eight years to bring a novel drug to market at an average cost of $800 million. Over the last ten years, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has helped to reduce the time from filing a new drug application (NDA) to granting marketing approval (i.e. the approval phase). However, there has been no alteration in the time required to progress from an investigational new drug application (IND) to an NDA filing (i.e. the clinical phase) over this same period. Since approval times began to decrease upon the initiation of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), in this thesis I analyze the impact of PDUFA and calculate its benefits to companies. Due to the importance of getting new drugs to the market faster, I also investigate why there has been no significant change in the time required to test a drug clinically, and attempt to identify steps that could be taken to improve the clinical trial process. To investigate this, I evaluated ways in which the FDA and industry can work together to reduce clinical development times, without compromising safety. The results from this study show that PDUFA has had a significant impact on reducing approval times. More importantly, I determined that the direct costs of PDUFA are small in irmlparison to its benefits. In addition, my analysis of the early clinical phases (pre-clinical to Phase II) of drug benefits. In addition, my analysis of the early clinical phases (pre-clinical to Phase II) of drug development has revealed potential steps both the FDA and industry can take to facilitate a more efficient process for assessing the safety and efficacy of drugs. Thus, this study represents an important step towards improving the development of medicines for the world.",

Even with this leadership position, there is evidence that the US is often not the first country to have new medical technology approved for patient use. In many cases, the European Union is the first geographic region to approve a new medical technology for sale, with US approval coming later. This delay in approval of new devices between the EU and US is referred to as the \"device lag.\" However, the extent or history of this lag over time and for different device types has not been examined. This thesis evaluated if a device approval lag has developed between US and EU at any time over the past 20 years and whether a device lag continues to exist today. US and EU regulatory approval data for 135 medical devices in three innovative medical device segments were collected and analyzed to evaluate the extent and history of the approval lag between the European Union and the United States. The collected approval data revealed a consistent approval lag between the US and EU in each of the three medical device segments explored in this study. Throughout the entire 20+ years of study, the United States had an average approval lag to the European Union in each of the three device segments, and an average lag for all devices of 21 months or almost 2 years (Ho: p. = 0, p = 8.2E-12). Furthermore, the device lag in these three segments has grown in recent years. These data are striking because they show, perhaps for the first time, that an approval lag has existed for medical devices between the US and EU for the past 20 years - since the beginning of the pan-European device regulatory system in the mid-1990s. The device lag is a useful metric for comparing the attractiveness of two markets for medical technology and may signal important changes in the medical technology industry. Furthermore, the existence of a persistent device approval lag in the United States may have significant implications for patients and their caregivers.",

    "abstract": "This thesis investigates the economic impact of stratified medicine on industry and the subsequent ethical implications for patients. Stratified medicine involves the use of clinical biomarkers to indicate differential response among patients in efficacy or potential side effects of therapeutic agents. The advent of stratified medicine should, in theory, result in the safer, more effective use of therapeutic agents to treat cancer. However, reluctance remains within the broader life sciences community, in particular within the pharmaceutical industry, to embrace stratified medicine. I hypothesize that this is due to economic concerns. Firstly, an historical analysis of the rate of market adoption of stratified therapeutics is conducted by comparing the adoption velocity and time to peak sales of stratified therapeutics relative to traditional chemotherapeutics. The aim is to analyze whether historically, stratified medicines have been more or less successful in terms of speed of market adoption. To supplement this analysis interviews are conducted with investment analysts who cover pharmaceutical and diagnostics companies to gauge their views on stratified medicine. This is important due to the fact that publicly traded companies have an obligation to their shareholders, and shareholder views are shaped by the analyses of these individuals. In order to assess the future economic impact of stratified medicine on industry, particularly given that clinical biomarkers are now being developed much earlier in the R&D timeline, a model was constructed to predict economic outcomes based on various parameters associated with biomarker development.",

This project employed a collagen-GAG scaffold specifically developed for tissue engineering and investigated the effect of this substratum on the formation of lung histotypic structures in vitro. A cell isolation procedure was developed whereby 19-days gestation type II alveolar cells reaggregated to form alveolar-like structures. The effects of selected scaffold design variables including pore diameter and degradation rate of the substratum on lung tissue regeneration were explored. Lung cell behavior revealed as the cells interact with an analog of the extracellular matrix was also examined. Differences in fetal and neonatal lung cell behavior were identified using histological analysis. Lung cells were obtained from Sprague-Dawley rats after 16-, 19-, and 20-days of gestation and at 2 days after term. These cells were seeded into type I collagen-GAG matrices, sized 8mm in diameter by 2mm in thickness. The medium used, F12K and Ham's nutrient mixture, was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. A seeding density between 1 to 5 million cells per sponge sample was used. Histology studies were performed at termination periods of 2, 14, and 28 days.

    "abstract": "It has become increasingly important for companies in the biopharmaceutical industry to maximize the clinical, commercial and economic impact of their products on a global scale. In this context, both Western and Asian firms have been engaging in international merger and acquisition (M&A) activities to improve global capabilities and competiveness. The M&A activities in the sector are driven by near-term expiration of blockbuster drug patents and marketplace pricing constraints, resulting in a perceived need to attain improved economies of scale. Across the industry, one can see an increased emphasis on biotechnology medicines (or biologics). Recent large business deals that have seen Pfizer acquire Wyeth, Merck acquire Schering-Plough and Roche complete the acquisition of Genentech all have some element of positioning around the exploitation of biologics for future growth. These trends are thought to put pressure on medium-/small-sized R&D firms to come up with competitive strategies in the global biologics market. Furthermore, the biologics market faces the threat of biosimilars (biogenerics or follow-on biologics). With the advent of expected changes in the US government healthcare policy, a number of companies will be facing competition from biosimilars in the near term. Mitigating the impact of the threat of biosimilars, to some extent, is the fact that manufacturing of most non-vaccine biologics is challenging because of the structural and biological complexity of the commercial product as well as the significant differences in the manufacturing process from one product to the next. Technical capacity and the ability to respond to shifting demands are likely to be one of the critical determinants for the success of individual companies in the biologics (and biosimilars) market. To meet the perceived needs, companies have either expanded their manufacturing capacity and capabilities by building inhouse facilities or by striking long-term supply deals through contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs). Utilizing highly efficient and cost-effective overseas biologics, CMOs could be a value-added business model for Western participants. The most dramatic cost-saving strategy would likely result from outsourcing operations to firms in emerging Asian countries like India and China. However, intellectual property protection and quality control issues have been considered problematic in these countries. In this context, other relatively well developed Asian countries-Japan, South Korea (referred to as Korea) and Singapore, which have relatively strong intellectual property protection and sophisticated manufacturing environments, might be strategic partners for Western firms in the contract biomanufacturing markets. In this research study, the current biopharmaceutical industry trends and global strategies of companies in Japan, Korea and Singapore were explored. As a sub-segment of the biopharmaceutical industry, the geographical features and defining characteristics of the biologics CMO market were examined. The framework for analysis was based on an assessment of the key contributing factors: capacity, capital and cost. The potential capabilities among emerging Asian participants in the global biologics CMO markets were assessed through personal interviews with senior/executive corporate managers of Asian domestic biopharmaceutical companies (principally Japanese and Korean firms). As the results indicate, the biopharmaceutical industry of each country has been influenced both by corporate strategy and government policy. The quantitative analyses show that the current biologics CMO market in these countries is underdeveloped with a few existing participants focusing on high-tech biomanufacturing of commercial products. In addition, the macro-and micro-environment of the biotechnology industry in these countries appears to be unfavorable for the development of a global biologics CMO market. Through individual interviews, it was found that biopharmaceutical corporate managers believe that the opportunities for growth/development of an Asian emerging CMO at the global level are modest, expressing the view that their direct presence in the biologics markets as global-scale CMO participants was unlikely to take place because of financial concerns (high risk investment and profit margin sharing), absence of a global network (no proven track record) and existence of an R&D-intensive corporate culture. In conclusion, while the capabilities of large and established domestic biopharmaceutical firms in these Asian countries certainly can meet regulatory, legal and technical requirements as emerging global CMO participants, the possibilities for development of a global CMO capability in these countries are likely to be small.

    "abstract": "Background: The optimal long-term antiplatelet therapy (APT) that balances the benefit of preventing myocardial infarction (MI) with the risk of severe bleeding is unknown in patients greater than one year after drug-eluting stent (DES) placement. Methods: We modeled life expectancy (LE) using published data by building a Markov model to compare several APT strategies composed of aspirin and clopidogrel, both as monotherapy and in various clinically plausible combinations. The base case examined a 65-year old person treated with a DES then continuous aspirin plus clopidogrel (Dual-Rx) for one year without complications. We considered risk of mortality from myocardial infarction and severe bleeding. We used a lifetime horizon and projected LE without quality-adjustment. Results: In the base-case analysis, APT yielding greatest LE was a toss-up between Dual-Rx indefinitely (LE of 13.48 years), clopidogrel indefinitely (LE of 13.45 years), and aspirin indefinitely (LE of 13.42 years); of the strategies considered, no APT was least preferred (LE of 13.36 years). All parameters were varied over plausible ranges in sensitivity analyses, including the duration of future treatment with clopidogrel (base-case, life long). The choice of APT remained a toss-up unless: the annual probability of MI fell below 0.0087 (base-case, 0.013) or the relative risk of systemic bleeding exceeded 1.52 (base case, 1.00), in which case clopidogrel indefinitely was preferred; or the efficacy of clopidogrel to prevent MI fell below 0.09 (base case, 0.20) or the relative risk of clopidogrel for severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage exceeded 3.33 (base case, 2.01), in which case aspirin indefinitely was preferred. Conclusions: For patients with a drug-eluting stent placed greater than one year ago, the antiplatelet therapy which yields the greatest life expectancy is a toss-up between dual antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel plus aspirin indefinitely), clopidogrel indefinitely, and aspirin indefinitely. However, additional research (including a clinical trial, subgroup analysis, and modeling) is needed.",

    "abstract": "Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) are developed primarily from knowledge gleaned from evidence-based research, guidelines, trusted resources and domain experts. While these resources generally represent information that is research proven, time-tested and consistent with current medical knowledge, they lack some qualities that would be desirable in a CDSS. For instance, the information is presented as generalized recommendations that are not specific to particular patients and may not consider certain subpopulations. In addition, the knowledge base that produces the guidelines may be outdated and may not reflect real-world practice. Ideally, resources for decision support should be timely, patient-specific, and represent current practice. Patient-oriented clinical decision support is particularly important in the practice of pediatrics because it addresses a population in constant flux. Every age represents a different set of physiological and developmental concerns and considerations, especially in medication dosing patterns. Patient clinical data warehouses (CDW) may be able to bridge the knowledge gap. CDWs contain the collective intelligence of various contributors (i.e. clinicians, administrators, etc.) where each data entry provides information regarding medical care for a patient in the real world. CDWs have the potential to provide information as current as the latest upload, be focused to specific subpopulations and reflect current clinical practice. In this paper, I study the potential of a well-known patient clinical data warehouse to provide information regarding pediatric levothyroxine dosing as a form of clinical decision support. I study the state of the stored data, the necessary data transformations and options for representing the data to effectively summarize and communicate the findings.",

    "abstract": "Here we describe an experimental method for measuring the acoustic transmission matrix of the middle-ear using otoacoustic emissions. The experiment builds on previous work that uses distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) as an intracochlear sound source to drive the middle-ear in reverse. This technique eliminates the complications introduced by needing to place an acoustic transducer inside the cochlea. Previous authors have shown how the complete 4x3 system response matrix, with its 12 unknowns, can be simplified to a 2x2 transmission matrix by de-coupling the middle-ear cavity and assuming the cochlear fluids are incompressible. This simplified description of middle-ear mechanics assumes that the input-output response at the tympanic membrane and stapes footplate is linear, one dimensional and time invariant. The technique allows for estimating the acoustic pressure and volume velocity at the tympanic membrane and the volume velocity of the stapes footplate, in both the forward and reverse direction, and under different boundary conditions at the stapes. The technique was applied to deeply anesthetized cats with widely opened middle-ear cavities over a frequency range of 200Hz to 10kHz. Results on three animals are reported and generally agree with previous data and a published middle-ear model.",

    "abstract": "Clinical x-ray mammography cannot delineate between hydroxyapatite and calcium oxalate, the respective forms of calcification in malignant and benign breast tumors. The water-poor nature of solid calcifications makes them difficult to image by conventional MRI. Recently, ultra-short echo time (UTE) MRI has enabled detection of solid calcified structures, but it is not specific to the underlying chemical composition. This thesis presents a hydroxyapatite-targeted gadolinium contrast agent for UTE MRI of calcification in malignant breast cancer. The hydroxyapatite-targeted contrast agent was synthesized by conjugating a bisphosphonate, pamidronate, to a gadolinium chelate. Binding specificity was tested by UTE MRI of the contrast agent reacted with hydroxyapatite, calcium oxalate, and other calcium-based crystals. The sensitivity of the contrast agent for hydroxyapatite was evaluated by UTE MRI: the lowest detectable concentration of hydroxyapatite-adsorbed contrast was 1 pM. Longitudinal relaxation time measurements were used to estimate the apparent relaxivity of the hydroxyapatite contrast agent to be >1000 s-I/mM. The targeted agent relaxivity is enhanced more than a 100-fold compared to conventional untargeted gadolinium contrast agents due to the restricted rotational motion of the contrast agent upon binding to a solid surface. In-vivo MRI of systemic delivery of the contrast agent was demonstrated in an animal model for breast cancer with hydroxyapatite calcifications. Pre- and post-contrast UTE MRI were acquired with systemic contrast agent injections. Dual-echo UTE subtraction images between short and long echoes showed specific uptake of the contrast agent to the calcifications. The mean signal intensity of the calcified regions enhanced by 200% between pre- and post-contrast images, posing the hydroxyapatite-targeted contrast agent as a clinical diagnostic for distinguishing benign and malignant calcification forms in breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Drug development in the United States is a lengthy and expensive endeavor. It is estimated that average development times range from eleven to fifteen years and exceed costs of one billion dollars. The development pathway includes basic scientific discovery, pre-clinical testing in animals, clinical development in humans, and an application process. The Food and Drug Administration is responsible for the oversight and approval of drugs going through this process. Numerous financial and economic studies have been conducted that show the benefits to accelerating the drug development process. In 1992, the United States Congress enacted the Prescription Drug User Fee Act I, which mandated faster response times from the FDA in return for user fee payments to the FDA by the drug developing companies. Data on approval times for new drugs indicate that this process was indeed shortened. In contrast, the average drug development process prior to the filing of an application has been increasing in cost and time. The first purpose of this research is to quantify the benefits of accelerated new drug application review time under the Prescription Drug User Fee Acts I and II. The second purpose of the research is to investigate what industry and the FDA can do together to reduce the development process time between the IND and NDA without compromising patient safety and welfare, specifically the Phase II, Phase III, and NDA components. The research indicates that PDUFA has improved approval times in a statistically significant way. Furthermore, the financial and social benefits as measured using net present value have far exceeded the PDUFA costs.

    "abstract": "Hepatocytes are widely used in the pharmaceutical and medical fields for drug metabolism studies, bioartificial liver devices, and repopulation of damaged livers as an alternative to transplantation. However, these cells are scarce and difficult to maintain in culture for prolonged periods of time. Banks of cryopreserved liver cells would significantly alleviate issues of hepatocyte availability, and efforts are being made to improve the viability and functionality of frozen hepatocytes. Previously, most work on improving post-thaw viability has hinged on limiting the physical damage of freezing by adding cryoprotective agents and optimizing cooling rates. Membrane-permeable cryoprotectants, such as dimethyl sulfoxide, though widely used, can be extremely toxic to the cell. More natural, non-membrane-permeable cryoprotectants, inspired by freeze-tolerant animals have also been used. A non-metabolizable glucose analog, 3-0-methyl- glucose (30MG), has shown promise with hepatocytes and was used in this study. Kinetics of the rGLUT2 cellular transporter used for 30MG uptake were quantified; Km and Vmax were determined to be 27.6 mM and 1.38 mM/s, respectively, by Lineweaver-Burk analysis and 70.0 mM and 1.82 mM/s, respectively, by Eadie-Hofstee analysis. This study also aimed to investigate the role of mitochondria in cell death induced by freezing. In particular, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was investigated as a predictor of a cell's likelihood to avoid apoptosis from freeze-induced stress.

    "abstract": "The health of the human respiratory system depends critically on airway clearance via motile hair-like structures (cilia), which transport and eliminate unwanted particles trapped within mucus. Impairment of mucociliary clearance (MCC) can lead to life-threatening airway narrowing and lung infections, and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia and chronic obstructive lung disease. However, no tool for microscopic in-vivo visualization of ciliary function is currently available, limiting studies of disease pathogenesis, refined diagnosis and phenotyping, and the development of novel therapeutics. In this thesis, a novel, 1-pm resolution, optical interferometric imaging technique termed Micro-OCT was incorporated into miniaturized common-path endoscopes and mucociliary transport was visualized in vivo for the first time. The first-generation Micro-OCT probe had a rigid design with outer diameter of 4 mm and a two-prism configuration providing beam splitting and sample beam shaping into an annular profile. Image quality of the probe allowed visualization of the periodic pattern of ciliary beating, measurement of airway surface liquid depth (ASL) and visualization of mucociliary transport. Unaltered ciliary function was demonstrated in a living, spontaneously breathing swine model. Newer generation common-path endoscope designs were demonstrated that improve, among other limitations, the stability of the reference reflector position and provide greater potential for miniaturization. The presented work opens unprecedented avenues for studying MCC and the effect of novel therapeutics within the complexity of a living organism. Further, it lays the groundwork for the development of a human probe with the potential to revolutionize diagnosis, phenotyping, and therapy management for all patients with respiratory disease involving the mucociliary escalator.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the research was to identify the clinical and commercial benefits of switching from intravenous (IV) to buccal delivery of antibiotics. then, the research continued to select 3-5 antibiotics that best met the buccal delivery and market requirements. Methods: The research began with the hypothesis that some injectable antibiotics are good candidates for buccal delivery even with the limitations imposed by the buccal tissue. The thesis captures a two-year research period encompassing three critical fronts - the clinical viability of switching from IV to buccal delivery for antibiotics, the market's desire and readiness to switch, and the antibiotic brands available for commercialization. Then the research moved to drug identification and selection in order to assess the antibiotics that would best function in the buccal delivery model. Results: Intravenous (IV) antibiotics are usually reserved for severe infections that require faster treatment. Less aggressive bacterial growths are treated with oral antibiotics, which has fewer side effects and complications. In the past two decades, the understanding of drug transport across different tissues has increased resulting in improved patient adherence to the therapeutic regimen and pharmacologic response. The administration of drugs by transdermal or transmucosal routes are relatively painless, offers patients more choices, and reduces the need to establish intravenous access, which is a particular benefit for children and elderly. These alternative methods also provide clinical care providers with more choices to better manage their patient's course of treatment. In the past, clinicians administered sedatives, narcotics, and a variety of other medications by transdermal, sublingual, nasal, rectal, and even tracheal-mucosal routes. These delivery options have provided flexible practice settings and this paper intends to show that antibiotics could be the next set of drugs to be administered in variety of ways to provide patients and clinicians the best array of choices. Conclusion: A few years ago, the buccal delivery method was fairly unknown.

    "abstract": "In this paper we evaluate how harmonization of patent laws in China and India to developed world standards has affected innovative research and development activity in the life sciences industry of those countries. The patents listed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office were used as a proxy to measure innovative activity. The number and types of patents filed over the period from 1976 through 2008 were analyzed for trends towards innovation. At a high level, we found that 'Drugs and Medical' account for only 6% of Chinese patents but make up 20% of the universe of Indian patents. When evaluating patent activity over time, we found that filings rose exponentially in the mid-nineties corresponding to the creation and implementation of product patent laws in both countries. India exhibited a much higher and steeper increase, likely due to its previously established capabilities as a generics manufacturer. When segmenting the data based on type of firms (academic, foreign multinationals and local private) we found that post product patent laws, local private firms exhibit more activity in India whereas local firms and multinationals show similar amounts of activity in China. In both countries, academic institutions show the greatest amount of activity compared to the multinationals and local private companies. We conclude that stronger IP laws have resulted in greater innovative activity as seen in the exponential rise in patent filings in the life sciences industry in both China and India. Although India has shown greater activity compared to China possibly due to its established capabilities in the generics space as a result of its protective patent regime prior to the harmonization.",

The goal of this study is to explore how pharmaceutical sales will change over the next 5 - 7 years and more specifically explore the role technology (including the internet) will play in the sales process. The study focuses on testing the perceptions of two key stakeholders -pharmaceutical executives and current medical students (future physicians) regarding the future of pharmaceutical sales process. Accordingly, 33 individuals were interviewed of which 18 were pharmaceutical executives and 15 were future physicians. The study tests three hypotheses: 1. Pharma executives believe that sales representative based detailing will continue to be the predominant method to engage and sell to physician customers while future physicians believe that technology will play a dominant role in the pharmaceutical detailing process. 2. Pharmaceutical executives agree that the most effective and ethical method to convey the benefits and challenges of an ethical pharmaceutical product are via a trained sales representative while future physicians believe that the sales representative does not effectively and ethically convey the merits of the relevant pharmaceutical therapy. 3. Person to person contact is not essential in conveying the merits of a particular ethical therapy - pharmaceutical executives disagree with this premise while future physicians agree.",

The results of this pilot study demonstrate that a map is possible. The draft map presented here will allow researchers and investors to focus on developing the next generation of HIT tools, including software platforms that orchestrate a variety of healthcare transactions, and will support policy makers as they consider the impact of Federal funding for HIT deployment and adoption.

    "abstract": "A recent analysis by the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development estimates that the cost of developing a single new chemical entity (NCE) into a successful therapeutic agent is $802 million. This figure is largely dependent on the expense of investigating NCEs that ultimately fail to be approved for use: between 70 - 90% of NCEs do not achieve New Drug Application (NDA) approval, and many of these failures are identified during the later, more costly phases of drug development. The exponential growth in the number of putative NCEs as a result of combinatorial chemistry and high-throughput screening has only confounded this problem by significantly increasing the number of early-phase NCEs under consideration for further costly development in human clinical trials. It is widely agreed upon that there are 3 major categories of reasons for drug failure: safety (toxicity), efficacy, and economics. This thesis is concerned with developing a Bayesian domain-knowledge probabilistic model (called Pharminator) to address the first two of these categories, with a goal of predicting clinical success of an NCE. Pharmacoeconomic modeling is a vastly different domain compared to Pharminator's clinical trial domain, and is beyond the scope of this thesis. While several clinical predictive models have been described in the literature over the past 10 years, the ongoing costly failure rate in drug development warrants developing more reliable predictors of NCE clinical success. The number of NDA approvals in 2002 fell to a 5-year low of 18, compared to 30, 35, 27, and 24 in 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001 respectively, despite rapidly increasing numbers of NCEs as a result of high-throughput screening and combinatorial chemistry.",

    "abstract": "Innovation within the medical device industry had led to tremendous advances in the provision of care for patients worldwide. Continued progress in the treatment of disease will require effective processes for managing and analyzing innovation within this industry. Popular models of innovation exist for many industries outside of the medical realm; however, an extensive literature search uncovered a limited body of work related to innovation within the medical device industry. Specifically, literature that examines the application of the principles of disruptive innovation to the medical device industry is limited in scope and in quantity. It is theorized that the medical device industry may have unique characteristics for disruptive innovation due to the unique economic and regulatory structures that exist within this industry. This thesis applies the principles of disruptive innovation that were popularized by Clayton Christenson's seminal work, \"The Innovator's Dilemma\", to the medical device industry. These characteristics are subsequently delineated and evaluated through examination of the prosthetic cardiac valve industry. This industry serves as an effective case study due to the long history of innovation and the emergence of new disruptive technology within this specialty. The categorization of a \"disruptive\" innovation was made when a given technology altered the value proposition for treating a disease, relative to incumbent technology. This case study was evaluated along metrics of performance characteristics, the perception of leading customers, the ability to prospectively analyze markets, and the profitability of disruptive innovation for the incumbent firm. Conclusions were reached based on an examination of relevant literature and primary research conducted with thought leaders in this area. This research supports the conclusion that the cardiac valve industry has experienced unique characteristics in the development and commercialization of disruptive innovations. Specifically, incentives appear to exist within this industry that support development and commercialization of disruptive innovations by industry incumbents. Furthermore, the importance of understanding what value proposition is being disrupted is paramount in effectively understanding the incentives of manufacturers to innovate. When a technology is developed that is disruptive to a procedure, then the manufacturer tends to behave similar to a \"newentrant\" within the Christenson framework. This appears to also be true when the innovation is disruptive to that manufacturer's legacy products.

First thought not, or only rarely, to occur in mammals, microRNAs are now among the major players in up-to-date genomic research. The mature molecules are ~22 nucleotides in length and, by targeting predominantly the 3' UTR of mRNAs, lead to translational repression or degradation of the target message, hence controlling important cellular mechanisms, including division, differentiation and death. This key role makes them excellent targets for cancer research. In fact they have been shown to have a major impact on cancer development in many cases. However, miRNAs are not a homogeneous class and can be sub classified into intragenic and intergenic, depending on their genomic position. Whereas intergenic miRNAs are expected to be independent transcriptional units, intragenic miRNAs are commonly believed to be regulated through their host gene. Despite of the growing knowledge on how miRNAs integrate into cellular regulatory networks, our current knowledge about the specific role of intragenic miRNAs is rather limited. In this work we integrated current miRNA knowledge bases, ranging from miRNA sequence and genomic localization information to target prediction, with biochemical pathway information and publicly available expression data to investigate functional properties of intragenic miRNAs and their relationship to their host genes. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to show in a large-scale analysis that intragenic miRNAs seem to act as negative feedback regulators on multiple levels.

    "abstract": "In normal-hearing ears, sound waves are amplified within the cochlea and a small fraction of the sound energy travels backward out into the ear canal, producing sounds known as \"otoacoustic emissions\" (OAE) that can be measured with a sensitive microphone. One class of OAE, called \"stimulus-frequency-otoacoustic-emissions\" (SFOAEs), has been hypothesized to be produced by a process known as \"coherent reflection filtering\" (CRF). The CRF theory provides a prediction between the SFOAE group delay and the group delays of tone responses on the basilar membrane within the cochlea.

    "text": "Auditory-nerve fiber responses to amplitude modulated tones and multi-tonal stimuli In normal-hearing ears, sound waves are amplified within the cochlea and a small fraction of the sound energy travels backward out into the ear canal, producing sounds known as \"otoacoustic emissions\" (OAE) that can be measured with a sensitive microphone. One class of OAE, called \"stimulus-frequency-otoacoustic-emissions\" (SFOAEs), has been hypothesized to be produced by a process known as \"coherent reflection filtering\" (CRF). The CRF theory provides a prediction between the SFOAE group delay and the group delays of tone responses on the basilar membrane within the cochlea.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a field with huge unmet need and only a few symptomatic treatments with limited efficacy have been made available to patients. With the testing of disease-modifying drugs in recent years, the length of AD clinical trials has tripled and the enrollment has gone up drastically. These investigational disease-modifying drugs address new targets including the amyloid beta and tau protein aggregation pathways in the brain. They have opened up a whole research field on biomarkers specific to these pathways. These biomarkers have however never been used to select a subpopulation that would enroll in clinical trials. This thesis defines a framework for assessing any AD biomarker's quality as a selection tool for enrolling a subpopulation into an AD clinical trial. Carefully selecting the patient population with appropriate biomarkers can lead to a reduction in required enrollment in a study to show statistical significance. In turn, the decreased patient enrollment helps sponsors reduce costs and allows them to test several drugs with the same budget. In order to test our framework in an applied and relevant setting, we established from www.clinicaltrials.gov that for disease-modifying drugs the primary endpoint is change in ADAS-cog points at 18 months and that the trials enrolled on average 337 patients per treatment group.

    "abstract": "The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has been the stalwart of research funding at universities and academic teaching hospitals. However, since the start of the last decade NIH funding has contracted in real terms. Anticipating future Federal Government fiscal austerity, the situation appears unlikely to improve and most likely will become worse. Local area teaching hospitals have explored other funding to support their large research infrastructure such as industry-sponsored research. This thesis qualitatively assessed whether the Federal Government and local area academic hospital fiscal data over the last six years support the hypothesis: Yes, industry funding has been received to support research at local area teaching hospitals to substitute for decreased availability of NIH funds. To test the hypothesis, Federal and local hospital fiscal data were extracted and statistical analysis was performed in three key areas to challenge the hypothesis and eliminate confounding data. First, is National Institutes of Health funding decreasing in real terms? Second, have local area teaching hospitals compensated by soliciting and receiving greater levels of industry sponsored research dollars? Third, has industry increased support in light of decreased NIH funding or are industry research commitments uncorrelated? The test questions were evaluated across two different hospitals and against various economic benchmarks. The hypothesis was rejected. Decreased NIH research funding granted to local academic hospitals has not caused a corresponding increase in industry sponsored research funding. Given the structural difficulties of industry and academic hospital collaboration, this likely impacts the level of industry sponsored research funding. Unfortunately, upcoming long-term Federal fiscal austerity may severely curtail NIH budgets.

The use of matrixembedded endothelial implants enabled the effects in cell culture to be expanded and validated in animal models. Moreover, endothelial cells exposed to a pathologically activating and inflammatory culture environment, similar to endothelial cells exposed to the atherosclerotic milieu, were leaky and inflamed, with dysregulated proliferative and leukocyte binding properties. Unlike healthy endothelial cells, which suppress cancer cell proliferation and metastasis, these dysfunctional endothelial cells instead aggressively stimulated cancer cell inflammatory signaling and invasiveness, which correlated with stimulation of spontaneous metastasis when implanted as matrixembedded cell implants adjacent to tumors. Fascinatingly we were able to identify markers of endothelial dysfunction, including reduction of endothelial perlecan expression, in human non-small cell lung carcinoma specimens. The state-dependent impact of endothelial cells on cancer biology adds another element to stromal regulation of cancer and brings together a range of disciplines and disparate findings regarding vascular control of tumors.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease for which there are no preventative or therapeutic interventions. It is currently understood to be linked to the accumulation of pathologic proteins in the brain. In the past several decades, a strong body of evidence has accumulated that is suggestive of a vascular-related pathway in AD. A deeper understanding of this phenomenon is critical in advancing our understanding of the AD biological process as well and may lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets. A common age-related change in the brain is the development of white matter signal abnormalities (WMSA) as seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These lesions are related to cognitive function and are thought to be due to compromised integrity of the brain's vascular system. Despite evidence that WMSA are known to influence the clinical progression of AD, we do not currently view AD as a vascular disease nor do we use WMSA as a clinical indicator of AD. This is because we still do not know whether or not WMSA are a distinct phenomenon in AD, their relationship to traditional AD biomarkers, and how they independently contribute to clinical status. In this work, we examine if and how WMSA are related to AD conversion, whether they differ in their spatial distribution between typical aging and AD, and how they are linked to classic pathologic markers of AD. This work also includes technical development for WMSA quantification and baseline studies of WMSA in cognitively healthy aging. The main findings of this work suggest that WMSA are distinctly different in AD than in typical aging and have a unique role in AD progression. This not only motivates the utility of WMSA in our clinical treatment of AD, but also provides insight into the biological underpinnings of the disease process that may lead to novel therapeutic targets.",

Current challenges include the increasing spread of drug resistant (DR) organisms, the side effects of antibiotic therapy, the negative consequences of clearing the commensal bacterial flora, and difficulties in developing prophylactic vaccines. This thesis was an investigation of the potential of a class of polymeric nanoparticles (NP) to contribute to the management of bacterial infections. More specifically, steps were taken towards using these NPs (1) to achieve greater spatiotemporal control over drug therapy by more targeted antibiotic delivery to bacteria, and (2) to develop a prophylactic vaccine formulation against the common bacterial sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. In the first part, we synthesized polymeric NPs containing poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)- block-poly(L-histidine)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PLGA-PLH-PEG). We show that these NPs are able to bind to bacteria under model acidic infection conditions and are able to encapsulate and deliver vancomycin to inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria in vitro. Further work showed that the PLGA-PLH-PEG-based NPs demonstrated the potential for competition for binding bacteria at a site of infection from soluble protein and model phagocytic and tissue-resident cells in a NP composition dependent manner. The NPs demonstrated low toxicity in vitro, were well tolerated by mice in vivo, and circulated in the blood on timescales comparable to control PLGA-PEG NPs. In the second part, we used PLGA-PLH-PEG-based NPs to design a prophylactic vaccine against the obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis, the most common cause of bacterial STD in the world. Currently, no vaccines against this pathogen are approved for use in humans.

    "abstract": "In humans, SFOAEs can non-invasively assess MOC strength and, may predict the MOC reduction of damage from traumatic sounds. However, the functionally important MOC effect is inhibition of auditory-nerve (AN) responses. Understanding the relationship between MOC effects on SFOAEs and AN CAPs is important for understanding SFOAE generation and for development of clinical tools that use these measures. This thesis presents several novel data sets that address MOC effects on SFOAEs, CAPs and the relationship between them in guinea pigs. Classic theory indicates that SFOAEs come from cochlear irregularities that coherently reflect energy at the peak of the traveling wave (TW), and that reflected energy arrives in the ear canal as a single wave at certain delay. Contrary to theory, in humans and chinchillas there have been reports of SFOAEs having multiple components with different delays, and that lowfrequency SFOAE delays are too short. The first thesis aim used time-frequency analysis to show that guinea pigs have frequency regions over which SFOAEs appear to have multiple components. However, we argue that the multiple components can be a simple result of variations in the patters of irregularities near the TW peak and are not necessarily indicative of multiple SFAOE sources. From comparison of our SFOAE delays with previously reported neural delays, we hypothesize that short SFOAE delays at low frequencies arise from a cochlear motion with a group delay shorter than the TW group delay. Aim 2 investigated how SFOAEs are affected by brainstem electrical stimulation of MOC fibers and found that MOC activation sometimes inhibited and sometimes enhanced SFOAEs. MOC stimulation always decreased CAP sensitivity which rules out SFOAE enhancement from increased cochlear amplification. We propose that shock-evoked MOC activity increases cochlear irregularity which results in increased SFOAE amplitudes. Aim 3 investigated the relationship between MOC effects on SFOAEs and tone-pip-evoked AN CAPs at same frequency and sound level. The ratio of the MOC effect on the SFOAE to the MOC effect on the CAP showed a highly-significant decrease (p<0.001) as the strength of MOC stimulation was increased.

    "title": "Neural correlates and mechanisms of sound localization in everyday reverberant settings",
    "abstract": "Nearly all listening environments-indoors and outdoors alike-are full of boundary surfaces (e.g., walls, trees, and rocks) that produce acoustic reflections. These reflections interfere with the direct sound arriving at a listener's ears, distorting the binaural cues for sound localization. Yet, human listeners have little difficulty localizing sounds in most settings. This thesis addresses fundamental questions regarding the neural basis of sound localization in everyday reverberant environments. In the first set of experiments, we investigate the effects of reverberation on the directional sensitivity of low-frequency auditory neurons sensitive to interaural time differences (ITD), the principal cue for localizing sound containing low frequency energy. Because reverberant energy builds up over time, the source location is represented relatively faithfully during the early portion of a sound, but this representation becomes increasingly degraded later in the stimulus. We show that the directional sensitivity of ITD-sensitive neurons in the auditory midbrain of anesthetized cats and awake rabbits follows a similar time course. However, the tendency of neurons to fire preferentially at the onset of a stimulus results in more robust directional sensitivity than expected, suggesting a simple mechanism for improving directional sensitivity in reverberation. To probe the role of temporal response dynamics, we use a conditioning paradigm to systematically alter temporal response patterns of single neurons. Results suggest that making temporal response patterns less onset-dominated typically leads to poorer directional sensitivity in reverberation. In parallel behavioral experiments, we show that human lateralization judgments are consistent with predictions from a population rate model for decoding the observed midbrain responses, suggesting a subcortical origin for robust sound localization in reverberant environments. In the second part of the thesis we examine the effects of reverberation on directional sensitivity of neurons across the tonotopic axis in the awake rabbit auditory midbrain. We find that reverberation degrades the directional sensitivity of single neurons, although the amount of degradation depends on the characteristic frequency and the type of binaural cues available. When ITD is the only available directional cue, low frequency neurons sensitive to ITD in the fine-time structure maintain better directional sensitivity in reverberation than high frequency neurons sensitive to ITD in the envelope. On the other hand, when both ITD and interaural level differences (ILD) cues are available, directional sensitivity is comparable throughout the tonotopic axis, suggesting that, at high frequencies, ILDs provide better directional information than envelope ITDs in reverberation. These findings can account for results from human psychophysical studies of spatial hearing in reverberant environments. This thesis marks fundamental progress towards elucidating the neural basis for spatial hearing in everyday settings. Overall, our results suggest that the information contained in the rate responses of neurons in the auditory midbrain is sufficient to account for human sound localization in reverberant environments.",

    "title": "Collagen scaffolds in full- and hemi- resection spinal cord injury models",
    "abstract": "Basic scientific research over the past few decades has shown some light on the complex pathophysiology of SCI and has enhanced our understanding of some of the important factors that contribute to the lack of regeneration following the initial traumatic injury and secondary injury response in the adult spinal cord. These factors include both intrinsic limitations in the regeneration capacity of mature neurons, but also a host of environmental factors which inhibit spontaneous attempts of axon regeneration. These environmental factors include physical barriers to axon regeneration such as fibrous and glial scars as well as molecules which actively inhibit regeneration. Even when these barriers are removed, axons in the central nervous system still require the appropriate stimulatory signals in order for significant regeneration to occur. These signals may include a substrate to provide directional guidance of the extending axon growth cones as well as neurotrophic factors to promote axon growth and survival. Thus, to achieve a clinically meaningful regenerative response following spinal cord injury a combinatorial therapeutic approach is likely necessary. This thesis investigated the use of a porous collagen scaffold with aligned pores to serve as a substrate for axon guidance and a delivery vehicle for select therapeutic agents in both fulland hemi- resection injury models in adult rats. In the hemi-resection injury model, the treatment groups included: a dehydrothermally (DHT) crosslinked scaffold, a carbodiimide (EDAC) crosslinked scaffold, and an EDAC-treated scaffold delivering either soluble Nogo receptor (sNgR), chondroitinase ABC (ChABC), or bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Improvement in hindlimb function over four weeks following injury was seen in the DHT scaffold, EDAC scaffold + ChABC, and EDAC scaffold + MSCs groups, but not in the untreated control group. Immunohistochemical evaluation of the tissue revealed a few regenerating axons reaching the center of the scaffold in the DHT scaffold and EDAC scaffold + ChABC groups at 4 week post injury. Histological evaluation at 4 weeks showed the defect area of all groups to be largely comprised of loosely organized fibrous tissue. Many macrophages were seen surrounding the defect area of all groups; however, there were significantly more macrophages within the defect area of the control group compared to the treatment groups. In the full-resection injury model, at 6 weeks post injury, implanted collagen scaffolds tended to reduce the number of cystic cavities in the defect and to better align the reparative tissue with the long axis of the spinal cord. These results show the potential benefit of collagen scaffolds alone or in combination with select therapeutic agents as a means to modulate the healing response following spinal cord injury.",

    "title": "Algorithms for enhanced spatiotemporal imaging of human brain function",
    "abstract": "Studies of human brain function require technologies to non-invasively image neuronal dynamics with high spatiotemporal resolution. The electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetoencephalogram (MEG) measure neuronal activity with high temporal resolution, and provide clinically accessible signatures of brain states. However, they have limited spatial resolution for regional dynamics. Combinations of M/EEG with functional and anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can enable jointly high temporal and spatial resolution. In this thesis, we address two critical challenges limiting multimodal imaging studies of spatiotemporal brain dynamics. First, simultaneous EEG-fMRI offers a promising means to relate rapidly evolving EEG signatures with slower regional dynamics measured on fMRI. However, the potential of this technique is undermined by MRI-related ballistocardiogram artifacts that corrupt the EEG. We identify a harmonic basis for these artifacts, develop a local likelihood estimation algorithm to remove them, and demonstrate enhanced recovery of oscillatory and evoked EEG dynamics in the MRI scanner. Second, M/EEG source imaging offers a means to characterize rapidly evolving regional dynamics within an estimation framework informed by anatomical MRI. However, existing approaches are limited to cortical structures. Crucial dynamics in subcortical structures, which generate weaker M/EEG signals, are largely unexplored. We identify robust distinctions in M/EEG field patterns arising from subcortical and cortical structures, and develop a hierarchical subspace pursuit algorithm to estimate neural currents in subcortical structures. We validate efficacy for recovering thalamic and brainstem contributions in simulated and experimental studies. These results establish the feasibility of using non-invasive M/EEG measurements to estimate millisecond-scale dynamics involving subcortical structures. Finally, we illustrate the potential of these techniques for novel studies in cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Within an EEG-fMRI study of auditory stimulus processing under propofol anesthesia, we observed EEG signatures accompanying distinct changes in thalamocortical dynamics at loss of consciousness and subsequently, at deeper levels of anesthesia. These results suggest neurophysiologic correlates to better interpret clinical EEG signatures demarcating brain dynamics under anesthesia.

    "abstract": "Human pluripotent stem (hPS) cells have the ability to reproduce indefinitely and differentiate into any cell type of the body, making them a potential source of cells for medical therapy and an ideal system to study fate decisions in early development. However, hPS cells exhibit a high degree of heterogeneity, which may be an obstacle to their clinical translation. Heterogeneity is at least partially induced as an artifact of removing the cells from the embryo and culturing them on a plastic dish. hPS cells grow in spatially patterned colony structures, which necessitates in situ quantitative single-cell image analysis. This dissertation offers a tool for analyzing the spatial population context of hPS cells that integrates automated fluorescent microscopy with an analysis pipeline. It enables high-throughput detection of colonies at low resolution, with single-cellular and sub-cellular analysis at high resolutions, generating seamless in situ maps of single-cellular data organized by colony. We demonstrate the tool's utility by analyzing inter- and intra-colony heterogeneity of hPS cell cycle regulation and pluripotency marker expression. We measured the heterogeneity within individual colonies by analyzing cell cycle as a function of distance. Cells loosely associated with the outside of the colony are more likely to be in G1, reflecting a less pluripotent state, while cells within the first pluripotent layer are more likely to be in G2, possibly reflecting a G2/M block. Our analysis tool can group colony regions into density classes, and cells belonging to those classes have distinct distributions of pluripotency markers and respond differently to DNA damage induction. Our platform also enabled noninvasive texture analysis of live hPS colonies, which was applied to monitoring subtle changes in differentiation state. Lastly, we demonstrate that our pipeline can robustly handle high-content, high-resolution single molecular mRNA FISH data by using novel image processing techniques.

MRI is used extensively in clinical medicine, but it is still not used for routine diagnostics due to high cost, limited availability, and long scan times. Many of these impracticalities come from the hardware requirements associated with generating images. Images, however, are not necessary to harness some of magnetic resonance's (MR's) diagnostic potential. This thesis demonstrates that that a single-voxel MR sensor can obtain the same results as a traditional MRI in both phantoms and humans. A clinical study with hemodialysis patients and age-matched healthy controls was performed at MGH. The T2 relaxation times of study participants' legs were quantified at multiple time points with both a 1.5T clinical MRI scanner and a custom 0.27T single-voxel MR sensor. The results showed that the first sign of fluid overload is an increase in the relative fraction of extracellular fluid in the muscle. The relaxation time of the extracellular fluid in the muscle eventually increases after more fluid accumulates. Importantly, these MR findings occur before signs of lower-extremity edema are detectable on physical exam. Two healthy control subjects became dehydrated over the course of the study and the relative fraction of their extracellular fluid decreased. This incidental finding suggests MR can measure the full spectrum of hydration states. Furthermore, a single MRI measurement at a single time point can distinguish fluid overloaded patients from healthy controls. The amplitude associated with extracellular fluid most closely correlates to fluid loss, and these amplitude decreases are detectable with both the MRI and MR sensor. The results of this work point towards a promising future of using cheaper, faster MR sensors for bedside diagnostics.",

Seventeen times as many hepatocytes were recovered from livers exposed to an hour of warm ischemia (WI, 34*C) compared to untreated WI livers in only 3 hours of perfusion. Further, fresh liver hepatocyte yields were also increased by 32% postperfusion, demonstrating that both damaged and healthy donor livers could benefit from this methodology. A linear correlation between cell yield and tissue ATP content was established. This enables an accurate prediction of cell recovery during preservation and can be used as a direct measure of organ viability and the trajectory of organ recovery during perfusion resuscitation. Further, a strong correlation between perfusion flow rate and cell yield was also established supporting the use of flow rates as low as possible without causing hypoperfusion or oxygen deprivation.

    "abstract": "In asthma, the key effector driving acute airway narrowing is thought to be airway smooth muscle (ASM); as the muscle surrounding the airways shortens, the airway lumen narrows. Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) - the excessive narrowing of the airways - is one of the cardinal features of asthma. Yet, the mechanism(s) regulating the airway lumenal radius, and perhaps the failure of these mechanisms to prevent excessive airway constriction, remains largely unexplained. This thesis shows that the regulation of ASM length corresponds to a dynamically equilibrated steady-state, not the static mechanical equilibrium that had been previously assumed. This dynamic steady state requires as an essential feature a continuous supply of external mechanical energy (derived from tidal lung inflations) that act to perturb the interactions of myosin with actin, drive the molecular state of the system far away from thermodynamic equilibrium, and bias the muscle toward lengthening. This mechanism leads naturally to the suggestion that excessive airway narrowing in asthma may be associated with the destabilization of that dynamic process and its resulting collapse back to static equilibrium. With this collapse the muscle undergoes a phase transition and virtually freezes at its static equilibrium length. This mechanism may help to elucidate several unexplained phenomena including the multi-factorial origins of AHR, how allergen sensitization leads to AHR, and the inability in asthma of deep inspiration to relax ASM.",

This mechanism may help to elucidate several unexplained phenomena including the multi-factorial origins of AHR, how allergen sensitization leads to AHR, and the inability in asthma of deep inspiration to relax ASM."

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis is a painful degenerative joint disease affecting millions of people in the U.S. The pathogenesis of articular cartilage disease is characterized by softening of cartilage and loss and disruption of constituent macromolecules including proteoglycans and collagen. In current orthopaedic surgical practice, the gold standard for evaluating articular cartilage integrity is the use of a hand probe during arthroscopy. Mechanical probing, however, is invasive and requires anesthesia. Tightly confined areas of the articular surface can be difficult to reach and assess, and manual probing provides a subjective rather than a quantitative assessment of cartilage mechanical integrity. This thesis was motivated by the desire for a noninvasive and nondestructive means to map the variation in mechanical stiffness of an articular surface. Such a method could potentially have application to guiding surgeons during procedures and quantitatively assessing the efficacy of medical and surgical therapies. It could also potentially provide patient-specific, in vivo tissue mechanical property data for surgical simulation and preoperative procedure planning. The macromolecule glycosaminoglycan (GAG) is a significant determinant of cartilage stiffness. GAG content can be assessed noninvasively in vivo and in vitro by an MRI-based technique known as delayed gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of cartilage (dGEMRIC), which measures the MRI parameter TI after equilibration with the ionic contrast agent Gd(DTPA)2-. With dGEMRIC, TlGd serves as an index of GAG content: we therefore examined whether cartilage stiffness could be related to dGEMRIC-measured TlGd in samples of human tibial plateaus.",

    "abstract": "Obtaining accurate needle placement is of critical importance in many medical scenarios. In the setting of fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), manual palpation is often the only cue for determining the optimal position of the needle. As a result, FNAB procedures frequently yield non-diagnostic tissue. When not guided by an imaging modality, breast and thyroid FNAB's only obtain diagnostic tissue in approximately 65% of cases. Although the addition of noninvasive imaging technology has been shown to increase FNAB yield, it is time-consuming, relatively expensive, and often requires additional personnel with specialized expertise. A need exists for low-cost, small, simple to use technologies that can provide active feedback during needle placement. One promising method for guiding needle placement would be to integrate an optical sensor that could identify tissue type at the tip of the needle in order to avoid non]diagnostic sampling. Optical technologies are well suited to this challenge because sensors can be made using optical fiber which is as thin a human hair. Optical frequency domain ranging (OFDR) is an optical ranging technique that is capable of measuring depth-resolved (axial, z) tissue structure, birefringence, flow (Doppler shift), and spectra at a micrometer level resolution. Analysis of the OFDR depth reflectivity profiles yields information about the nature of the tissue being interrogated at the tip of the probe and algorithms can be developed to automatically differentiate between tissue types. The overall goal of this thesis is to develop a small, portable, point-of-care optical system that can be used to differentiate human breast tissue and guide needle placement in the setting of FNAB. We will investigate enabling technologies that allow for efficient simplification and miniaturization of an OFDR system including signal processing algorithms for automatically differentiating tissue type, a miniature battery-powered laser, and a study of the effect of reduced-bit depth acquisition for OFDR systems.

The first part of the thesis consists of studies we performed to test whether MSC conditioned medium (MSC-CM) can treat rats undergoing cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI). When AKI rats were treated with MSC-CM, we observed a survival benefit and significant protection of renal function compared to controls. The second part of the thesis will describe the development of a device designed for sustained delivery of MSC secreted factors to dialysis-dependent AKI subjects. We tested these devices for cell function, stability and viability when subjected to conditions that model future clinical operation. Finally, inspired by the therapeutic capacity of MSC secreted factors, this thesis will conclude with the introduction of a new method that we developed to uncover novel anti-inflammatory proteins from MSCs. This method revealed four previously unidentified cytokine modulators, two of which we found significantly promote IL-1 0 and suppress TNF-a in mice challenged with endotoxin. When leveraged as novel therapeutics for lethal endotoxemic shock, these two most potent modulators protected mice and provided for a significant survival benefit compared to vehicle controls.

However, the implementation of this strategy has faced two major obstacles. First, the long-term shutdown of tumor blood vessels by the anti-angiogenesis agent can prevent the tumor from receiving a therapeutic concentration of the chemotherapy agent. Second, inhibiting blood supply drives the formation of intra-tumoral hypoxia, or a lack of oxygen, which has been correlated with increased tumor invasiveness and resistance to chemotherapy. In this thesis we report the disease-driven engineering of a drug delivery system, a 'nanocell', which overcomes these barriers unique to solid tumors. The nanocell comprises a nuclear nanoparticle encapsulated within a lipid membrane and is preferentially taken up by the tumor. The nanocell delivers a temporal release of two drugs within the tumor core: the outer lipid envelope first releases an anti-angiogenesis agent, causing a vascular shutdown; the inner nanoparticle, which is trapped inside the tumor, then releases a chemotherapy agent. This focal release within the tumor targets cells most at risk for hypoxia and results in improved therapeutic index with reduced toxicity.

Current technologies that evaluate biological phenomenon often force a compromise between quantification of gene expression via bulk assays and qualitative imaging of cell and tissue heterogeneity. There are few options that allow for quantitative, high-resolution, single-cell analysis that is robust but not associated with a high degree of technical difficulty or obscured by amplification. Here, we address these issues using two model systems, the developing mammalian inner ear and single mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) during the process of X inactivation, to demonstrate our ability to perform single-cell, single-molecule assays that reveal both highly quantitative and spatial information. Accordingly, we adapted a high resolution, single-molecule RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization technique (smFISH) to study gene expression in the inner ear and perform allele-specific detection of the X chromosome in mESCs. We used previously-published smFISH procedures as our initial template for investigating biological signaling phenomena in these two systems. To study gene expression in the mouse inner ear, we developed a modified smFISH strategy to investigate mRNA transcript expression patterns in the cochlea during auditory hair cell development. The mammalian cochlea, a highly specialized and complex organ, beautifully demonstrates both the depth and breadth of the smFISH technique. To assay signaling behavior and topological changes of the X chromosome prior to X inactivation, we incorporated a novel allele-specific modification into the smFISH technique. We investigate the allele-specific expression patterns of eight genes that tile the X chromosome, which were chosen for their varied putative roles before, during and after X chromosome inactivation. Taken together, these two systems recapitulate the strength of the smFISH technique and its adaptations. The goals of this thesis were twofold: (1) expand the smFISH technique to work in specialized mammalian systems such as the cochlea and (2) demonstrate allele-specific DNA topological changes and expression patterns in mESCs.

The injection of the iron oxide contrast agent (MION) provided a 9-fold increase in efficiency for block designs relatively to BOLD contrast.

Using large-scale genomic data sets of solid tissue tumor biopsies, we quantified the cytolytic activity of the local immune infiltrate and identified associated properties across 18 tumor types. The number of predicted MHC Class I-associated neoantigens was correlated with cytolytic activity and was lower than expected in colorectal and other tumors, suggesting immune-mediated elimination. We identified recurrently mutated genes that showed positive association with cytolytic activity, including beta-2- microglobulin (B2M), HLA-A, -B and -C and Caspase 8 (CASP8), highlighting loss of antigen presentation and blockade of extrinsic apoptosis as key strategies of resistance to cytolytic activity. Genetic amplifications were also associated with high cytolytic activity, including immunosuppressive factors such as PDL1/2 and ALOX12B/15B. Our genetic findings thus provide evidence for immunoediting in tumors and uncover mechanisms of tumor-intrinsic resistance to cytolytic activity. Second, we combined measurements of protein production and degradation and mRNA dynamics so as to build a quantitative genomic model of the differential regulation of gene expression in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mouse dendritic cells. Changes in mRNA abundance play a dominant role in determining most dynamic fold changes in protein levels. Conversely, the preexisting proteome of proteins performing basic cellular functions is remodeled primarily through changes in protein production or degradation, accounting for more than half of the absolute change in protein molecules in the cell.

    "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful technology that provides a means to alter the expression of a specific protein based on a targeted RNA sequence. This is done by taking advantage of existing cellular machinery present within all eukaryotic cells which use short double-stranded RNA sequences as guides for RNA induced silencing. The potential for RNAi in medicine is enormous, providing a new approach to treat the complex biological dysregulation underlying many diseases. This promise of a new branch of therapeutics however has been mired with difficulties. RNA is quickly degraded by nucleases that are prevalent in the blood and throughout the body, it is highly immunogenic, and systemic delivery is complicated by high clearance rates. As such, developing formulations for the effective delivery of short RNAs presents significant hurdles. Local delivery can limit numerous unwanted systemic side effects of therapies and it maintains the highest therapeutic index possible in a targeted area before clearance. As such, the local delivery of siRNA may hold just as much potential as systemic delivery with significantly reduced complications. Layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly is a robust method that has been successfully demonstrated for the localized and sustained delivery of many biologic therapeutics and biomolecules. Developing an LbL film capable of delivering siRNA locally would offer a powerful new approach to the treatment of local disorders. This approach could be combined with existing medical devices to improve patient outcomes by directly addressing pathologic dysregulation in the area of interest. One field where the local treatment of dysregulation could be of particular interest is that of wound healing. Wound healing is a complex and highly synchronized process of multiple biological pathways, consisting of an assortment of cytokines, growth factors, and varied cell types which evolves over time. The development of a drug delivery system that can locally modify cell behavior on the basic level of gene transcription would be a powerful tool to alter the dynamics of wound healing. There are many known complications of wound healing, ranging from chronic ulcerative wounds to hypertrophic contractile scars, which dramatically affect the lives of tens of millions of patients every year. Through RNA interference, one could specifically target the key mediators of these complications, providing a means to more effectively regulate the wound healing process in vivo. The capability to deliver siRNA locally to address these complications is a significant advance in the current state of wound treatment. As such, this work presents an opportunity to substantially improve the current standard of treatment for patients and their wound healing outcomes. Herein, we present the design and preclinical evaluation of a number of strategies to develop ultra-thin polymer coatings for the controlled delivery of RNA both in vitro and in vivo. We used Layer-by-Layer assembly to create siRNA containing polymer-based films that can sustain the release of complexed siRNA over physiologically relevant timescales for local delivery into tissues. We describe the development of the first high-throughput approach for LbL assembly and screening and its use to identify lead candidate film architectures for RNA delivery. We then apply these findings to treat dysregulation in two distinct animal models; a chronic diabetic mouse wound model and a third-degree bum model in rats, targeting three different genes of interest independently. These coatings were demonstrated to effectively coat a number of medically relevant substrates including bandages, sutures, surgical staples, nanoparticles, microparticles, and microneedles. This body of work provides insight into how siRNA can be incorporated into thin film assemblies and the design criteria to achieve successful gene knockdown in vitro and in vivo.",

There are many known complications of wound healing, ranging from chronic ulcerative wounds to hypertrophic contractile scars, which dramatically affect the lives of tens of millions of patients every year. Through RNA interference, one could specifically target the key mediators of these complications, providing a means to more effectively regulate the wound healing process in vivo. The capability to deliver siRNA locally to address these complications is a significant advance in the current state of wound treatment. As such, this work presents an opportunity to substantially improve the current standard of treatment for patients and their wound healing outcomes. Herein, we present the design and preclinical evaluation of a number of strategies to develop ultra-thin polymer coatings for the controlled delivery of RNA both in vitro and in vivo. We used Layer-by-Layer assembly to create siRNA containing polymer-based films that can sustain the release of complexed siRNA over physiologically relevant timescales for local delivery into tissues. We describe the development of the first high-throughput approach for LbL assembly and screening and its use to identify lead candidate film architectures for RNA delivery. We then apply these findings to treat dysregulation in two distinct animal models; a chronic diabetic mouse wound model and a third-degree bum model in rats, targeting three different genes of interest independently. These coatings were demonstrated to effectively coat a number of medically relevant substrates including bandages, sutures, surgical staples, nanoparticles, microparticles, and microneedles. This body of work provides insight into how siRNA can be incorporated into thin film assemblies and the design criteria to achieve successful gene knockdown in vitro and in vivo."

In parallel MRI, radiofrequency (RF) detector coil arrays are used to perform some degree of spatial encoding which complements traditional encoding using magnetic field gradients. As the acceleration factor increases, coil design becomes critical to the overall image quality. The quality of a design is commonly judged on how it compares with other coil configurations. A procedure to evaluate the absolute performance of RF coil arrays is proposed. Electromagnetic calculations to compute the ultimate intrinsic signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) available for any physically realizable coil array are shown, and coil performance maps are generated based on the ratio of experimentally measured SNR to this ultimate intrinsic SNR. Parallel excitation, which involves independent transmission with multiple RF coils distributed around the body, can be used to improve the homogeneity of RF excitations and minimize the RF energy deposited in tissues - both critical issues for MRI at high magnetic field strength. As its use is explored further, it will be important to investigate the intrinsic constraints of the technique. We studied the trade-off between transmit homogeneity and specific absorption rate (SAR) reduction with respect to main magnetic field strength, object size and acceleration. We introduced the concept of ultimate intrinsic SAR, the theoretical smallest RF energy deposition for a target flip angle distribution, and we calculated the corresponding ideal current patterns.

However, the translation of RNAi into the clinic has been thwarted by the \"delivery\" challenge, as small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics must overcome clearance mechanisms and penetrate into tumor tissues to access cancer cells. This thesis sought to develop nanotechnology-based platforms to rapidly discover and validate cancer targets in vivo. First, we developed versatile surface chemistries for nanoparticle tumor targeting. Leveraging new discoveries in amplified transvascular transport, we designed a siRNA delivery system that integrates the tumor specificity and tissue-penetrating ability of tumor-penetrating peptides with membrane penetration properties of protein transduction domains to direct siRNA to tumors in vivo. Second, we utilized this delivery system to bridge the gap between cancer genomic discovery and in vivo target validation. Comprehensive analysis of ovarian cancer genomes identified candidate targets that are undruggable by traditional approaches. Tumor-penetrating delivery of siRNA against these genes potently impeded the growth of ovarian tumors in mice and improved survival, thereby credentialing their roles in tumor initiation and maintenance. Lastly, we described efforts extending this platform for clinical translation. Mechanistic studies identified functional properties that favored receptor-specific siRNA delivery.

    "abstract": "The innate immune system is the first line of host defense, and its ability to propagate antimicrobial and inflammatory signals from the cellular microenvironment to the tissue at-large is critical for survival. In a remarkably complex microenvironment, cells are constantly processing external cues, initiating convoluted intracellular signaling cascades, and interacting with neighboring cells to generate a global, unified response. At the onset of infection or sterile injury, individual cells sense danger or damage signals and elicit innate immune responses that spread from the challenged cells to surrounding cells, thereby establishing an overall inflammatory state. However, little is known about how these dynamic spatiotemporal responses unfold. Through the use GFP reporters, in vitro transplant coculture systems, and in vivo models of infection and sterile injury, this thesis describes identification of a gap junction intercellular communication pathway for amplifying immune and inflammatory responses, and demonstrates its importance in host innate immunity. The first section describes development of stable GFP reporters to study the spatiotemporal activation patterns of two key transcription factors in inflammation and innate immunity: Nuclear factor-KappaB (NFKB) and Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). Stimulation of NFKB-GFP reporters resulted in a spatially homogeneous pattern of activation, found to be largely mediated by paracrine action of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFa. In contrast, the activation of IRF3 was spatially heterogeneous, resulting in the formation of multicellular colonies of activated cells in an otherwise latent background. This pattern of activation was demonstrated to be dependent on cell-cell contact mediated communication between neighboring cells, and not on paracrine signaling. The second section describes the discovery of a gap junction intercellular communication pathway responsible for the formation of IRF3 active colonies in response to immune activation. Cell sorting and gene expression profiling revealed that the activated reporter colonies, collectively, serve as the major source of critical antimicrobial and inflammatory cytokines. Using in vitro transplant coculture systems, colony formation was found to be dependent on gap junction communication. Blocking gap junctions with genetic specificity severely compromised the innate immune system's ability to mount antiviral and inflammatory responses. The third section illustrates an application of the gap junction-induced amplification of innate immunity phenomenon in an animal model of sterile injury. Drug-induced liver injury was shown to be dependent on gap junction communication for amplifying sterile inflammatory signals. Mice deficient in hepatic gap junction protein connexin 32 (Cx32) were protected against liver damage, inflammation, and death in response to hepatotoxic drugs. Co-administration of a selective pharmacologic Cx32 inhibitor with hepatotoxic drugs significantly limited hepatocyte damage and sterile inflammation, and completely abrogated mortality. These finds suggests that co-formulation of gap junction inhibitors with hepatotoxic drugs may prevent liver failure in humans, and potentially limit other forms of sterile injury. In summary, this thesis demonstrates the development of novel tools for investigating the spatiotemporal dynamics of cellular responses, describes how these tools were utilized to discover a basic gap junction communication pathway critical in innate immunity, and provides evidence for the clinical relevance of this pathway in sterile inflammatory injury.",

    "abstract": "The clinical course of infection is ultimately determined by a series of cellular interactions between invading pathogens and host immune cells. It has long been understood that these interactions, even when they occur in tissue culture models, give rise to a wide variety of different outcomes, some beneficial to the host, others to the pathogen.

Here, we present a system that combines single-cell RNA sequencing with fluorescent markers of infection outcome to directly correlate host transcription signatures with infection outcome at the single cell level. Applying this system to the well-characterized model of Salmonella enterica infection of mouse macrophages, we found: 1) Unique transcription signatures associated with bacterial exposure and bacterial infection, 2) Sustained high levels of heterogeneity in immune pathways in infected macrophages, and 3) A novel subpopulation of macrophages characterized by high expression of the Type I Interferon response after infection. Upon further investigation we found that this heterogeneity in the host Type I Interferon response was the result of heterogeneity in the population of infecting bacteria, namely in the extent of PhoPQ-mediated LPS modifications.

    "abstract": "Cancer is a complex disease of the genome exhibiting myriad somatic mutations, from single nucleotide changes to various chromosomal rearrangements. The technological advances of next-generation sequencing enable high-throughput identification and characterization of these events genome-wide using computational algorithms. Retrotransposons comprise 42% of the human genome and have the capacity to \"jump\" across the genome in a copy-and-paste manner. Recent studies have identified families of retrotransposable elements that are currently active. In fact, retrotransposons constitute a major source of human genetic variation, and somatic retrotransposon insertions have been implicated in several cancers, including an insertion into the APC tumor suppressor in a colorectal tumor. Because of the highly repetitive nature of these elements, however, the full extent of somatic retrotransposon movement across cancer remains largely unexplored. To this end, we developed TranspoSeq, a computational framework that identifies retrotransposon insertions from paired-end whole genome sequencing data, and TranspoSeq- Exome, a tool that localizes these insertions from whole-exome data. TranspoSeq identifies novel somatic retrotransposon insertions with high sensitivity and specificity in simulated data and with a 94% validation rate via site-specific PCR. Next, we applied these methods to wholegenomes from 200 tumor/normal pairs and whole-exomes from 767 tumor/normal pairs across 11 tumor types as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Pan-Cancer Project. We discover more than 800 somatic retrotransposon insertions primarily in lung squamous, head and neck, colorectal and endometrial carcinomas, while glioblastoma multiforme and acute myeloid leukemia show no evidence of somatic retrotransposition. Moreover, many somatic retrotransposon insertions occur in known cancer genes. TranspoSeq-Exome uncovers 35 additional somatic retrotransposon insertions into exonic regions, including an insertion into an exon of the PTEN tumor suppressor in endometrial cancer. Finally, we integrate orthogonal genomic and clinical data to characterize features of retrotransposon insertion and samples that exhibit extensive somatic retrotransposition. We present a large-scale, comprehensive analysis of retrotransposon movement across tumor types using next-generation sequencing data. Our results suggest that somatic retrotransposon insertions may represent an important class of tumor-specific structural variation in cancer and future studies should incorporate this form of somatic genome aberration.",

Central to this goal is the analysis of functional architecture, which is crucial to an understanding of how the brain works. In my thesis research, I applied behavioral and microstimulation techniques to demonstrate the causal connections between neural activity and behavior. Understanding these relationships is one of the fundamental issues needed to be addressed in Neurobiology. Specifically, I focused on the functional analysis of the middle temporal visual area (MT) and the behavior associated with it. MT is an extrastriate area that is primarily involved in visual motion processing. A very important function within MT is a segregation of center-surround interactions which plays a critical role in processing visual motion cues. There are two types of motion center-surround interactions in MT neurons: surrounds may reinforce (at wide-field sites) or suppress (at local-motion sites) the centers' directional responses. They are important in representing the initial stages of a functional segregation between wide-field and local-contrast motion processing. To further study the computational model used by the brain to readout sensory information, I conducted microstimulation experiments in MT by changing stimulation amplitudes (from 10/LA to 160tA) and frequencies (from 25Hz to 500Hz). Microstimulation can introduce an additional velocity signal into MT and the pursuit and saccadic systems usually compute a vector average of the visually evoked and microstimulation-induced velocity signals.",

    "abstract": "Aneuploidy, an abnormal complement of chromosomes, is present in approximately 90% of human malignancies. Despite over 100 years of research, many questions remain regarding the contribution of aneuploidy to the cancer phenotype. In this thesis, we develop computational methods to infer the presence and specific patterns of aneuploidy across thousands of primary cancer tissue specimens. We then combine these inferences with clinical and genomic features of the cancer samples to refine our understanding of both the clinical implications of aneuploidy, and how it evolves in various human cancers. We identified a signature of chromosomal instability from specific genes whose expression was consistently correlated with aneuploidy in several cancer types, and which was predictive of poor clinical outcome multiple cancer types. Current genomic characterization techniques measure somatic alterations in a cancer sample in units of genomes (DNA mass). The meaning of such measurements is highly dependent on the tumors purity and its overall ploidy; they are hence complicated to interpret and compare across samples. Ideally, copy-number should be measured in copies-per-cancer-cell. Such measurements are straightforward to interpret and, for alterations that are fixed in the cancer cell population, are simple integer values. We develop two computational methods to infer tumor purity and malignant cell ploidy directly from allelic analysis of DNA. First we describe HAPSEG, a probabilistic method to interpret bi-allelic marker data in cancer samples in order to produce genome-wide estimates of homologue specific copy-ratios. Second, we describe ABSOLUTE, a method that infers purity, ploidy, and absolute copy-numbers from the estimates produced by HAPSEG. In addition, ABSOLUTE can analyze point mutations to detect subclonal heterogeneity and somatic homozygosity. We used ABSOLUTE to analyze ovarian cancer data and discovered that 54% of somatic point mutations were, in fact, subclonal. In contrast, mutations occurring in key tumor suppressor genes, TP53 and NF1 were predominantly clonal and homozygous. Analysis of absolute allelic copy-number profiles from 3,155 cancer specimens revealed that genome-doubling events are common in human cancer, and likely occur in already aneuploid cells in many cancer types. By correlating genome-doubling status with mutation data, we found that homozygous mutations in NF1 occurred predominantly in non-doubled samples.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting over 5.1 million individuals in the United States today. The dementia exhibited with the disease is currently thought to be primarily due to amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. However, several other changes occur, including severe white matter damage that is yet to be fully understood. Such white matter damage includes white matter lesions (WML), which are more common in individuals with Alzheimer's disease than in non-demented individuals. WML are of presumed vascular origin because they show features of small-vessel disease and are more prevalent in individuals with vascular risk. It is currently unclear whether WML are linked to the neurodegenerative pathologies of Alzheimer's disease or are an independent factor that influences clinical course. In this work, we used sensitive diffusion MRI measures to determine that the tissue properties of WML slightly differed microstructurally between individuals with Alzheimer's disease and non-demented controls, and were strongly related to ventricular enlargement. In order to further understand the role of WML, we factored the volume of WML with four other neuroimaging markers affected in Alzheimer's disease and discovered two statistically distinct factors presumed to be due to differing underlying disease processes. One process strongly related to volume and tissue properties of WML, ventricular enlargement, age and cerebral perfusion, while the other process related to imaging markers associated with neurodegeneration. A decrease over time in the first process, interpreted as the age- and vascular-related factor, led to similar cognitive decline as the neurodegenerative factor independently, demonstrating the potential added therapeutic benefit of targeting this disease process that is distinct from the classical neurodegenerative component of the disease.",

One technique that has shown potential for measuring vocal function but has been mostly used to quantify speech-related behaviors besides phonation is measuring the acceleration of the skin near the larynx. The acceleration of the skin on the neck between the cricoid cartilage and the sternal notch arises from the airflow pulses that result from vocal-fold vibration. At least two sets of structures play a role in transforming these airflow pulses into the measured acceleration: the subglottal system, and the tissues between the subglottal airspace and the accelerometer (e.g., tracheal cartilage, skin, etc.). Advantages of measuring acceleration over current techniques include 1) the structures that filter the glottal pulses vary less over time than the vocal tract and thus they may be adequately modeled as time-invariant, making signal processing potentially easier; 2) environmental acoustic noise has a minimal influence on the measured acceleration; and 3) the accelerometer's size and placement make it more comfortable and unobtrusive for extended recordings than current techniques.

In order to gain a better understanding of drug efficacy in patients, we developed three diagnostic technologies to address limitations in sample acquisition and improve the scale and sensitivity of current cancer diagnostic tools. In the first section, we describe a hybrid magnetic and size sorting microfluidic device that isolates rare circulating tumor cells from peripheral blood. The self-assembled magnetic sorter creates strong magnetic fields and effectively removes leukocytes tagged with magnetic nanoparticles. The size sorting region retains the remaining cells in single cell capture sites, while allowing small red blood cells to pass through 5pm gaps. The device achieves over 103 enrichment, up to 96% recovery of cancer cells and allows for on-chip molecular profiling. In the second section we use a magnetic nanoparticle decorated with small molecule drugs to assay target expression and drug binding in mock clinical samples of cancer cells spiked into whole blood. Specifically, we modify a PARP inhibitor (Olabarib) and conjugate it to a dextran coated iron oxide nanoparticle. We measure the presence of the drug nanosensor based on the change in T2 relaxation time using a miniaturized, handheld NMR sensor for point-of-care diagnosis. In the final section, we detail a photocleavable DNA barcoding method for understanding treatment response via multiplexed profiling of cancer cells. We validate our method with a 94 marker panel on different cell lines with varying treatments, showing high correlations to gold standard methods such as immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Furthermore, we demonstrate single cell sensitivity, and identify a number of expected biomarkers in response to cell treatments. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our method to help in clinical monitoring of patients by examining intra- and inter-patient heterogeneity, and by correlating pre and post-treatment tumor profiles to patient response. Together, we show how these technologies can help overcome clinical limitations and expedite advancements in cancer treatment.",

The device achieves over 103 enrichment, up to 96% recovery of cancer cells and allows for on-chip molecular profiling. In the second section we use a magnetic nanoparticle decorated with small molecule drugs to assay target expression and drug binding in mock clinical samples of cancer cells spiked into whole blood. Specifically, we modify a PARP inhibitor (Olabarib) and conjugate it to a dextran coated iron oxide nanoparticle. We measure the presence of the drug nanosensor based on the change in T2 relaxation time using a miniaturized, handheld NMR sensor for point-of-care diagnosis. In the final section, we detail a photocleavable DNA barcoding method for understanding treatment response via multiplexed profiling of cancer cells. We validate our method with a 94 marker panel on different cell lines with varying treatments, showing high correlations to gold standard methods such as immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Furthermore, we demonstrate single cell sensitivity, and identify a number of expected biomarkers in response to cell treatments. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our method to help in clinical monitoring of patients by examining intra- and inter-patient heterogeneity, and by correlating pre and post-treatment tumor profiles to patient response. Together, we show how these technologies can help overcome clinical limitations and expedite advancements in cancer treatment."

    "title": "Paxillin-dependent control of tumor angiogenesis",
    "abstract": "Angiogenesis- the growth of new capillaries from existing vessels- is required for tumor growth; however, tumor vessels exhibit abnormal structure and function, which impairs the targeted delivery of anti-cancer agents. While directional migration of capillary endothelial cells is critical for normal angiogenesis, the mechanism by which oriented capillary cell migration is controlled or how it is deregulated during tumorigenesis is unknown. Recently our lab reported that the focal adhesion protein, paxillin, is required for directional migration of fibroblasts. Endothelial cells also express paxillin and localize it in their focal adhesions. Thus, I set out to analyze whether paxillin influences directional migration of endothelial cells. When the expression of paxillin is knocked down in endothelial cells, this enhances their migration but decreases their directional persistence in vitro and in vivo in migration, angiogenesis and developmental assays. Having confirmed that paxillin plays a central role in controlling oriented capillary cell migration, I then studied the mechanism by which it contributes to normal microvessel network formation and tumor angiogenesis. I found that paxillin knockdown increases microvessel density but causes loss of sprout orientation. These characteristics resemble those of tumor vasculature, and, in fact, studies revealed that tumors inhibit paxillin expression in endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo by secreting soluble factors, such as the potent angiogenic factor VEGF. Mechanistically, paxillin knockdown decreases expression of the VEGF receptor neuropilin 2 (NRP2) but not VEGF receptor 2, and this is mediated by the transcription factor GATA2. Direct knockdown of NRP2 also increases endothelial cell migration and vessel density in vitro and in vivo and these effects are rescued by over expressing paxillin. In summary, these studies have led to the discovery of a new mechanism for control of directional endothelial cell migration during angiogenesis that is mediated by paxillin-NRP2 signaling. Importantly, this previously unknown mechanism is deregulated in tumor angiogenesis, which may contribute to the enhanced, disorganized microvasculature that is hallmark of cancer. These findings also revealed a new function for the focal adhesion protein, paxillin, as a mediator of tumor angiogenesis, and elucidated a novel mechanism for control of the expression of NRP2.",

Viral delivery systems have been held back by immunogenicity and toxicity concerns, but synthetic vectors have lagged in transfection efficiency. This thesis describes the rational design and systematic study of three classes of bioresponsive polymers for nucleic acid delivery. A central theme of the study was understanding how the structure of the polymers impacted each of the intracellular steps of delivery, rather than solely the end result. A powerful tool for efficiently quantifying endosomal escape was developed and applied to each of the material systems described. First, a linear-dendritic poly(amido amine) -poly(ethylene glycol) (PAMAM-PEG) block copolymer system previously developed in our lab was evaluated and its ability to overcome the sequential barriers of uptake, endosomal escape, and nuclear import were characterized. Next, a class of crosslinked linear polyethyleimine (xLPEI) hyperbranched polymers, which can contain disulfideresponsive linkages, were synthesized and investigated. It was demonstrated that free polymer in solution, not the presence of a functional bioresponsive domain, was responsible for the highly efficient and relatively nontoxic DNA delivery of this promising class of crosslinked polyamines. Finally, this analysis was applied to siRNA delivery by a library of amine-functionalized synthetic polypeptides. The pH-responsive secondary structure, micelle formation, and ester hydrolysis were studied prior to the discrete barrier-oriented analysis of the siRNA delivery potential of this library.

The primary aim of this work was to use layer-by-layer assembly to advance ophthalmic drug delivery modalities post cataract surgery to overcome the challenges of traditional postoperative therapy. Hydrolytically degradable multilayer films were used to create a multi-drug delivery coating for intraocular lenses (IOL). The establishment of a drug delivery coating for intraocular lenses required key advances in ultrathin film technology.

A correlation between polycation hydrophobicity, as determined using octanol:water coefficients, allowed for the reliable prediction of release dynamics.

Using this wavelet-based shape representation, we build multi-scale shape models and study the localized cortical folding variations in a normal population using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We then build a shape-based classification framework for detecting pathological changes of cortical surfaces using advanced classification methods, such as predictive Automatic Relevance Determination (pred-ARD), and demonstrate promising results in patient/control group comparison studies. Thirdly, we develop a nonlinear temporal model for studying the temporal order and regional difference of cortical folding development based on this shape representation.

Because of its widely demonstrated utility for in vitro applications, researchers are increasingly investigating related in vivo clinical applications of electroporation, such as gene delivery, drug delivery, and tissue ablation. In this thesis, we describe a quantitative, mechanistic model of electroporation and concomitant molecular transport that can be used for guiding and interpreting electroporation experiments and applications. The model comprises coupled mathematical descriptions of electrical transport, electrodiffusive molecular transport, and pore dynamics. Where possible, each of these components is independently validated against experimental results in the literature. We determine the response of a discretized cell system to an applied electric pulse by assembling the discretized transport relations into a large system of nonlinear differential equations that is efficiently solved and analyzed with MATLAB. We validate the model by replicating in silico two sets of experiments in the literature that measure electroporation-mediated transport of fluorescent probes. The model predictions of molecular uptake are in excellent agreement with these experimental measurements, for which the applied electric pulses collectively span nearly three orders of magnitude in pulse duration (50 ts -20 ms) and an order of magnitude in pulse magnitude (0.3 -3 kV/cm). The advantages of our theoretical approach are the ability to (1) analyze in silico the same quantities that are measured by experimental studies in vitro, (2) simulate electroporation dynamics that are difficult to assess experimentally, and (3) quickly screen a wide array of electric pulse waveforms for particular applications.

The level of STR variation and its effect on phenotypes remains mostly uncharted, mainly due to the difficulty in accurately genotyping STRs on a large scale. To overcome bioinformatic challenges in STR genotyping, we developed lobSTR, an algorithm for profiling STRs from high throughput sequencing data. lobSTR employs a unique mapping strategy to rapidly align repetitive reads, and uses statistical learning techniques to account for STR-specific noise patterns. We applied lobSTR to generate the largest and highest quality STR catalog to date. This provided the first characterization of more than a million loci and gave novel insights into population-wide trends of STR variation. We used our catalog to conduct a genome-wide analysis of the contribution of STRs to gene expression in humans. This revealed that STRs explain 10-15% of the cis heritability of expression mediated by common variants and potentially play a role in various clinically relevant conditions.

There is a need for a low cost device that falls in between these two methods, and can provide quantitative and repeatable results. In addition, continuous monitoring of gait would be useful for real-time physical rehabilitation. To free patients from the confines of a motion laboratory, this thesis has resulted in a wireless wearable system capable of measuring many parameters relevant to gait analysis. The extensive sensor suite includes three orthogonal accelerometers, and three orthogonal gyroscopes, four force sensors, two bi-directional bend sensors, two dynamic pressure sensors, as well as electric field height sensors. The \"GaitShoe\" was built to be worn on any shoes, without interfering with gait, and was designed to collect data unobtrusively, in any environment, and over long periods of time. Subject testing of the GaitShoe was carried out on ten healthy subjects with normal gait and five subjects with Parkinson's disease. The calibrated sensor outputs were analyzed, and compared to results obtained simultaneously from The Massachusetts General Hospital Biomotion Lab; the GaitShoe proved highly capable of detecting heel strike and toe off, as well as estimating orientation and position of the subject.

    "text": "A shoe-integrated sensor system for wireless gait analysis and real-time therapeutic feedback Clinical gait analysis currently involves either an expensive analysis in a motion laboratory, using highly accurate, if cumbersome, kinematic systems, or a qualitative analysis with a physician or physical therapist making visual observations. There is a need for a low cost device that falls in between these two methods, and can provide quantitative and repeatable results. In addition, continuous monitoring of gait would be useful for real-time physical rehabilitation. To free patients from the confines of a motion laboratory, this thesis has resulted in a wireless wearable system capable of measuring many parameters relevant to gait analysis. The extensive sensor suite includes three orthogonal accelerometers, and three orthogonal gyroscopes, four force sensors, two bi-directional bend sensors, two dynamic pressure sensors, as well as electric field height sensors. The \"GaitShoe\" was built to be worn on any shoes, without interfering with gait, and was designed to collect data unobtrusively, in any environment, and over long periods of time. Subject testing of the GaitShoe was carried out on ten healthy subjects with normal gait and five subjects with Parkinson's disease. The calibrated sensor outputs were analyzed, and compared to results obtained simultaneously from The Massachusetts General Hospital Biomotion Lab; the GaitShoe proved highly capable of detecting heel strike and toe off, as well as estimating orientation and position of the subject. A wide variety of features were developed from the calibrated sensor outputs, for use with standard pattern recognition techniques to classify the gait of the subject.

    "title": "Electro-anatomical models of the cochlear implant",
    "abstract": "While cochlear implantation has become the standard care in treating patients with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss, the variation in benefit (communicative ability) individual patients derive from implantation remains both large and, for the most part, unexplained. One explanation for this variation is the status of the implanted ear which, when examined histopathologically, also displays substantial variation due to both the pathogenesis of hearing loss (etiology, etc.) and pathological changes initiated by implantation. For instance, across-patient variation in electrode position and insertion depth is clearly present, as are differential amounts of residual spiral ganglion survival, fibrous tissue formation and electrode encapsulation, cochlear ossification, and idiosyncratic damage to adjacent cochlear structures. Because of the complex geometric electrical properties of the tissues found in the implanted ear, demonstrating the impact of pathological variability on neuronal excitation, and ultimately on behavioral performance, will likely require a detailed representation of the peripheral anatomy. Our approach has been to develop detailed, three-dimensional (3D) electro-anatomical models (EAMs) of the implanted ear capable of representing the aforementioned patient-specific types of pathological variation. In response to electric stimulation, these computational models predict an estimate of (1) the 3D electric field, (2) the cochleotopic pattern of neural activation, and (3) the electrically-evoked compound action potential (ECAP) recorded from intracochlear electrodes. This thesis focuses on three aims. First, two patient-specific EAMs are formulated from hundreds of digital images of the histologically-sectioned temporal bones of two patients, attempting to incorporate the detailed pathology of each. Second, model predictions are compared to relevant reports from the literature, data collected from a cohort of implanted research subjects, and, most importantly, to archival data collected during life from the same two patients used to derive our psychophysical threshold measures, and ECAP recordings) collectively show a promising correspondence between model-predicted and empirically-measured data.

    "abstract": "The primary function of the heart is to pump blood at a sufficient rate to ensure perfusion of all the organs. This vital task is achieved in large part by controlling the rate of cardiac contractions, which are initiated by cells in the sinoatrial node, the \"pacemaker\" of the heart. The oscillation rate of these spontaneously active cells is tightly regulated by the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system. Our understanding of sinoatrial node cell function has been greatly advanced by experimental and modeling efforts that quantitatively describe the numerous ionic currents responsible for the cell's spontaneous depolarization and generation of the action potential. Several models have also explored the effect of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity on specific ion channels and have reproduced the classic slowing and acceleration phenomena. However, a complete model of this interaction does not exist: current models lack the ability to simulate simultaneous sympathetic and parasympathetic activation or to reproduce heart rate dynamics in response to time-varying autonomic inputs. We addressed this need by constructing a bottom-up model of sinoatrial node cell regulation by the autonomic nervous system, with a focus on reproducing the full range of heart rates observed under simultaneous sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve stimulation, as well as the dynamic heart rate response to steps in sympathetic or parasympathetic stimulation rate. In constructing our model, we consolidate a large body of experimental data in a consistent mathematical framework. The model comprises 57 nonlinear coupled ordinary differential equations based on first principles and the current mechanistic understanding of the component reactions, fits well all the experimental data used to build the model, and reproduces high-level features of the system that were not explicitly fit when building the model. The detailed nature of the model also allows numerous conclusions to be drawn about the mechanisms of heart rate control. A better understanding of these mechanisms in health and disease may enable the development of better diagnostics for cardiovascular disease and more targeted drug design.

    "abstract": "Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is the most common form of adult onset muscular dystrophy, affecting more than 1 in 8000 individuals globally. The symptoms of DM are multi-systemic and include myotonia, severe muscle wasting, cardiac arrhythmias, cataracts, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and cognitive deficits. DM is caused by the expansion of CTG or CCTG repeat sequences expressed in noncoding portions of RNA, which sequester or activate RNA splicing factor proteins, leading to widespread deleterious changes in transcriptome isoform usage. We developed a method for studying transcriptomes, RNAseq, which provides a high resolution, digital inventory of gene and isoform expression. By applying RNAseq to human tissues and cell lines, we discovered that essentially 92-94% of all human genes are alternatively spliced, 86% of them with a minor isoform frequency 15% or more. We found that the majority of alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation and cleavage events are tissue-regulated, and that patterns of these RNA processing events are strongly correlated across tissues, implicating protein factors that may regulate both types of events. We applied this method towards the goal of identifying transcriptome changes occurring in DM, focusing on the Muscleblind-like (MBNL) family of RNA binding proteins, which are functionally inactivated by CUG or CCUG repeats. Using RNAseq to profile tissues and cells depleted of MBNLs, we found that MBNL1 and MBNL2 co-regulate hundreds of redundant targets. MBNL1 UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation, followed by sequencing (CLIPseq), was used to identify the in vivo transcriptome-wide binding locations of MBNL1, and facilitated the construction of a context-dependent RNA map for MBNL1 splicing regulation. Extensive 3' UTR binding of MBNL1 was found to localize mRNAs to membrane compartments of mouse myoblasts, suggesting a new global function for MBNLs, and additional mechanisms by which MBNL depletion can lead to DM symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Progressive bulbar motor deterioration resulting from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) leads to speech impairment. Despite the devastating consequences of speech impairment to life quality, few options are available to objectively assess speech motor involvement. The overarching goal of this research was to derive objective measures of speech acoustics that can be used to support clinical decision making. To achieve this goal, we obtained 121 speech samples from 33 patients with ALS who repeated the phrase \"Buy Bobby a puppy\" five times in succession. In total, 342 acoustic features were semi-automatically extracted from each speech recording. Pearson correlations were computed between each feature and three metrics of overall speech severity: sentence intelligibility, speaking rate, and communication efficiency. The findings were grounded within a physiologic framework where acoustic features were grouped into one of three domains that when combined, were hypothesized to broadly characterize articulatory performance: articulatory specification, articulatory coupling, and articulatory consistency. To obtain the most accurate prediction of ALS with the features we extracted, we compared two machine learning algorithms: linear regression and random forest. In shuffle-split cross-validation, the strongest mean Pearson correlations we obtained between actual and predicted intelligibility, speaking rate, and communication efficiency were 0.67, 0.74, and 0.77, respectively (SD=0.077, 0.050, and 0.059, respectively). Of the three domains, the specificity features were the most strongly associated with intelligibility impairments (mean r=0.68), and coupling was the most strongly associated with slower speaking rate (mean r=0.73). Specificity and coupling yielded similar performances in communication efficiency prediction. Other contributions of this thesis are that it is the first to implement a framework of dysarthric speech in terms of three domains: specification, coupling, and consistency; the first to validate automated formant tracking in dysarthric speech; and the first to perform an in-depth investigation into physiologically-inspired acoustic features that describe articulatory impairments of patients with ALS. Novel findings include the presence of abnormal formant coupling patterns, which may suggest greater tonguejaw coupling, in patients with more severe dysarthria due to ALS. Areas of future research involve further feature discovery, improved analysis methods, and a deeper understanding of relations to articulatory kinematics.",

The CN comprises three major subdivisions: anteroventral, posteroventral and dorsal (AVCN, PVCN and DCN, respectively), each of which contains anatomically and physiologically distinct neurons projecting onto different targets. This research used focal electric stimulation of small, confined parts of the CN in anesthetized guinea pigs to resolve the roles of the CN divisions, in two contexts. Part i explored the effect of stimulation on the gross neural potential (electrically evoked auditory brainstem response, EABR). In AVCN and PVCN away from the 8th nerve fibers entering the brainstem, stimulation consistently evoked waveforms comprising 3 waves, suggesting a diffuse distribution of cellular generator of the EABR. On the other hand, in vestibular structures (vestibular nerve root and Scarpa's ganglion), the characteristic waveform comprised only two waves. Stimulation of multiple neural structures, as seen with higher stimulus levels or stimulation in auditory nerve root area generally produced more complex and variable waveforms. Part 2 explored the effects of stimulation on the activation of one type of auditory reflex, medial olivocochlear (MOC) reflex. The reflex was monitored through its effects on distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE). The MOC reflex was activated bilaterally by stimulating PVCN or AVCN shell, but not AVCN core.

The current standard treatment for advanced ovarian cancer includes a minimally invasive cytoreduction surgery, followed by intravenous (IV) or intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy with cisplatin and taxol. Clinical trials showed that the IP cisplatin treatment regimen was able to prolong overall survival by 16 months but only 42% of subjects completed all cycles of the IP therapy. The primary reason for the early termination of the IP treatment is catheter-related complications. The implantation of the catheter is also a complex procedure that can only be performed at premier centers by trained personnel. An alternative for IP administration that eliminates catheter-related complications and simplifies IP drug administration would therefore allow more patients to enjoy the benefits of IP therapy. A drug delivery device for use in a mouse model was developed as a tool to prove that maintaining a low constant cisplatin concentration in the peritoneal cavity and serum would improve the treatment outcome and reduce drug-related toxicity in ovarian cancer, compared to periodic IP bolus drug infusion. The device demonstrated highly linear and easily tunable in vitro release and exhibited excellent in vitro-in vivo correlation. Investigations of the device pharmacokinetics in vivo proved that the device was able to maintain a low and constant cisplatin concentration both locally in the peritoneal cavity and in the serum over up to six weeks. In vitro cytotoxicity of continuous cisplatin dosing with various human ovarian cancer cells lines was demonstrated. An in vivo xenograft SKOV-3 tumor model was established and optimized to reflect the distribution of ovarian cancer metastases in humans. The device achieved effective tumor growth retardation without systemic toxicity. An IP bolus injection scheme with a similar area-under-curve (AUC), however, caused severe bone marrow depletion. The results verified that the treatment efficacy correlates with the AUC but not the peak concentration, Cma.

    "title": "Online control of articulation based on auditory feedback in normal Speech and stuttering : behavioral and modeling studies",
    "abstract": "Articulation of multisyllabic speech requires a high degree of accuracy in controlling the spatial (positional) and the temporal parameters of articulatory movements. In stuttering, a disorder of speech fluency, failures to meet these control requirements occur frequently, leading to dysfluencies such as sound repetitions and prolongations. Currently, little is known about the sensorimotor mechanisms underlying the control of multisyllabic articulation and how they break down in stuttering. This dissertation is focused on the interaction between multisyllabic articulation and auditory feedback (AF), the perception of one's own speech sounds during speech production, which has been shown previously to play important roles in quasi-static articulations as well as in the mechanisms of stuttering. To investigate this topic empirically, we developed a digital signal processing platform for introducing flexible online perturbations of time-varying formants in speakers' AF during speech production. This platform was in a series of perturbation experiments, in which we aimed separately at elucidating the role of AF in controlling the spatial and temporal parameters of multisyllabic articulation. Under these perturbations of AF, normal subjects showed small but significant and specific online adjustments in the spatial and temporal parameters of articulation, which provided first evidence for a role of AF in the online fine-tuning of articulatory trajectories. To model and explain these findings, we designed and tested sqDIVA, a computational model for the sensory feedback-based control of speech movement timing. Test results indicated that this new model accurately accounted for the spatiotemporal compensation patterns observed in the perturbation experiments. In addition, we investigated empirically how the AF-based online speech motor control differed between people who stutter (PWS) and normal speakers. The PWS group showed compensatory responses significantly smaller in magnitude and slower in onset compared to the control subjects' responses. This under-compensation to AF perturbation was observed for both quasi-static vowels and multisyllabic speech, and for both the spatial and temporal control of articulation. This abnormal sensorimotor performance supports the hypothesis that stuttering involves deficits in the rapid internal transformations between the auditory and motor domains, with important implications for the neural basis of this disorder.",

    "abstract": "Clinical voice specialists make critical diagnostic, medical, therapeutic, and surgical decisions by coupling visual observations of vocal fold tissue motion with auditory-perceptual assessments of voice quality. The details of the relationship between vocal fold tissue motion and the voice produced are not fully understood, and there is recent evidence that the diagnostic significance of asymmetries during vocal fold vibration may be over-interpreted during clinical voice assessment. An automated system based on high-speed videoendoscopy recordings was developed to objectively quantify vocal fold vibratory asymmetry with initial validation from manual markings and visualperceptual judgments. Efficient estimation of these measures was possible due to recent technological advances in high-speed imaging of the larynx that enabled the capture and processing of high-resolution video (up to 10,000 images per second) of rapid vocal fold vibrations (100-1000 times per second). Synchronized recordings of the acoustic voice signal were made to explore physiological-acoustic relationships that were not possible using clinical stroboscopic imaging systems. In an initial study of asymmetric vibration in 14 patients treated for laryngeal cancer, perturbations in the voice signal were most associated with asymmetry that changed across vibratory cycles, while the overall level of asymmetry did not contribute to degradations in voice quality measures.",

From clinical genetic screenings to publication of data in research studies, these activities have the potential to disclose identity, medical conditions, and hereditary data. To enable an era of personalized medicine, many research studies are attempting to correlate individual clinical outcomes with genomic data, leading to thousands of new investigations. Critical to the success of many of these studies is research participation by individuals who are willing to share their genotypic and clinical data with investigators, necessitating methods and policies that preserve privacy with such disclosures. We explore quantitative models that allow research participants, patients and investigators to fully understand these complex privacy risks when disclosing medical data. This modeling will improve the informed consent and risk assessment process, for both demographic and medical data, each with distinct domain-specific scenarios. We first discuss the disclosure risk for genomic data, investigating both the risk of re-identification for SNPs and mutations, as well as the disclosure impact on family members. Next, the deidentification and anonymization of geospatial datasets containing information about patient home addresses will be examined, using mathematical skewing algorithms as well as a linear programming approach.

    "title": "Characterization of cochlear transcription, translation and energy extraction in aging and noise-induced pathology",
    "abstract": "Success in otologic practice is currently limited by the diagnostic tools and treatment options available to address an individual's specific presentation of hearing loss. This limitation results from insufficient characterization of the inner ear's biochemical environment as well as physical hurdles associated with accessing inner ear tissues. The encapsulation of the hearing organ within a bony shell and delicate nature of its tissues make standard tissue biopsy techniques impossible and leave many imaging methods impractical. This thesis sought to approach these clinical limitations in two ways: (1) performing novel transcriptional and translational characterizations of inner ear tissues and (2) development of a novel technique to access and communicate diagnostic information from within the inner ear. The first part of this thesis employs whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing to study murine inner ear transcriptional activity in young, healthy animals as well as changes associated with organ aging and noise-induced auditory neuropathy, an important mechanism of hearing impairment in humans. Knowledge of the inner ear's transcriptional behavior (Part I) is coupled with novel translational insights provided by high-throughput tandem mass-spectrometry (Part III) studies of human inner ear fluids obtained from healthy and pathologic populations. These studies illuminate homeostatic mechanisms employed by the highly specialized inner ear tissues, providing a critical knowledge-base for inner ear scientists and pharmacologists, and identify important expression-level changes which occur during the onset and progression of inner ear pathologies. While these high-throughput studies offer the powerful ability to gain a wealth of knowledge into which genes are active within the inner ear, functional assessment of the specific role these genes play must be assessed in a more focused manner. Phenotypic characterization of mice with specific genetic mutations (Part II) has been performed to provide critical insight into the specific role Fgf23 plays in development and maintenance of the auditory system. The second arm of this thesis seeks to provide clinical practicality to the above work by developing a method to safely access the inner ear environment to gather and communicate diagnostic information (Part IV). A guinea pig model was utilized to develop an approach to insert microelectrodes into the fluid spaces of the inner ear in order to harness and monitor the natural electrochemical gradient of the organ. The useful energy extracted from this \"biological battery\" was used to power a combined microchip/radio transmitter capable of performing voltage-sensing operations within endolymph and wirelessly relaying this information to an external receiver. This study was the first to utilize a mammalian electrochemical potential to power an electronic device. By performing this task while preserving the integrity of the hearing organ this work provides the first, critical proof-of-concept demonstration toward clinically-applicable sensing and therapeutic devices powered by the inner ear. Further refinement of this technique into a long-term, fully-implantable device will enable previously impossible longitudinal studies of organ behavior in awake, behaving subjects and the incorporation of sensing modalities into current inner ear prostheses to monitor biochemical changes and maximize patient benefits.",

    "abstract": "Autocrine signaling plays essential roles in providing self-sustaining growth signals to cancer cells. Since the introduction of the autocrine hypothesis in 1980s, the contribution of autocrine signaling in cancer medicine has been limited to cancer tissues with adequately characterized mitogenic pathways. Its closed-loop nature and complex interplay with other environmental cues prevents the experimental study of unknown autocrine loops, requiring specific perturbing agents to inhibit the underlying ligand/receptor interactions. Recent studies reported the ability of drug-resistant cancer cells to acquire mitogenic signals from previously neglected autocrine loops, causing tumor recurrence. Methods that can evaluate autocrine-loop dependency in more diverse cancer tissues will help identify other means that autocrine signaling employs to maintain cancer growth. This thesis presents the use of cell-patterning methods as a tool for modulating intrinsically generated diffusive signaling cues. Such technology enables the investigation of autocrine loops without the need for specific therapeutics or prior knowledge of underlying ligand/receptor pairs. To achieve this goal, the first aim of this thesis is to determine characteristics of autocrine signaling that pertain to modulation of intercellular spacing, using existing investigation methods. In addition to demonstrating the limitation of conventional methods in examining unknown autocrine loops, we showed that changes of intercellular spacing in randomly plated culture cannot specifically modulate autocrine activity, due to the concurrent changes of other environmental cues. The second aim of this thesis is to establish engineering tools for 1) ensuring modification of only autocrine loops with the modulated cell arrangement and 2) providing prediction of autocrine activity changes with varying intercellular spacing. We illustrated cell-patteming approaches for introducing spatial regularity to standard cell culture. We then developed a stochastic model to predict changes of ligand/receptor binding with varying cell arrangement designs. We determined the spatial requirement for autocrine activity to transition from the isolated to the communicative mode. The model also helps determine cell-patterning designs that can potentially maintain uniform impacts of non-diffusive signaling cues while enabling specific modulation of autocrine signaling. In the last aim of this thesis, we evaluated the ability of regularly-shaped cell arrays to demonstrate the impact of autocrine signaling in supporting cancer growth. In comparison to randomly-plated culture, the cellpatterning platform exhibited growth change with altering intercellular spacing that better corresponds with the predicted and measured changes of autocrine ligand capture. With increasing global cell density, we also showed that regularly-shaped cell arrays acquire more uniform distribution of local cell density, while the randomly-plated cells exhibit distinct changes of local cell density. We present in this thesis the first method for the modulation of combined autocrine activity while ensuring minimal concurrent alteration of non-diffusive cues without the need of specific perturbing agents.",

    "abstract": "Afflicting almost 200 million worldwide, hepatitis C virus (HCV) mounts a chronic infection of liver hepatocytes that causes substantial morbidity and mortality. An understanding of host-virus interactions will drive the development of therapeutics, but research is restrained by available experimental tools. Due to the cost and unreliability of existing humanized mouse and primate in vivo models, HCV research is almost exclusively performed using in vitro platforms which suffer from three major limitations. First, challenges in primary hepatocyte culture and the general non-permissiveness of liver cell lines have necessitated the use of a uniquely permissive hepatoma line derived from a single donor, questioning the generalizability of findings to the broader population. Second, this cell line deviates appreciably from native liver in functions central to HCV infection, including innate immune signaling, polarization, and proliferation. Third, infection is typically studied using bulk assays with suboptimal specificity, sensitivity, and content. Here, we describe three technologies for overcoming these limitations in the study of host-virus interactions. We demonstrate their utility in exploring innate immune signaling, a clinically significant component of HCV pathogenesis. Section I describes an in vitro platform for investigating inter-host variations in the natural history of infection and treatment response. We show that directed differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) yields patient-specific liver tissue that is permissive to HCV and responds to infection with a robust innate immune response, opening the door to \"personalizing\" the study and treatment of infection. In Section II, we demonstrate that tissue-engineered, micropatterned co-cultures (MPCCs) of primary hepatocytes and supportive stroma are permissive to HCV, enabling investigations in a more natural host. We then show that innate immune signaling curtails infection in this model, and that its inhibition enhances infection 2-3 orders of magnitude. Lastly, we use MPCCs to uncover a novel liver immunoregulatory mechanism whereby innate immune surveillance is depressed, permitting efficient replication of hepatotropic pathogens. Finally, Section III details a high-content imaging assay that enables visualization and enumeration of single viral genomes in individual cells. We demonstrate that single-cell, multiplexed quantification of viral genomes and host gene transcripts can be used to dissect host-virus interactions, yielding an unexpected positive correlation between stage of infection and response to an innate immune cytokine. The solutions described here will enable the pursuit of previously intractable research questions for HCV and other viruses, accelerating progress towards the development of antivirals and vaccines. Further, the insights gained regarding the interplay between HCV and innate immunity have important clinical ramifications, including a novel therapeutic strategy.",

    "title": "The role of HIF-1 alpha in the localization of embryonic stem cells with respect to hypoxia within teratomas",
    "abstract": "In embryonic stem (ES) cell tumors, the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor, HIF- 1[alpha], has been shown to be a tumor suppressor, and HIF-1[alpha]-expressing cells have been shown to localize preferentially in vivo to regions near tumor vasculature. These differences were proposed to be due to increased hypoxia-induced apoptosis and growth arrest of HIF-1[alpha]-expressing ES cells. This thesis presents a careful investigation into the localization of ES cells in vitro and in vivo with respect to hypoxia. A sandwich culture system was utilized in which controlled gradients of oxygen and nutrients are developed in the vicinity of the tumor cells.

    "text": "The role of HIF-1 alpha in the localization of embryonic stem cells with respect to hypoxia within teratomas In embryonic stem (ES) cell tumors, the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor, HIF- 1[alpha], has been shown to be a tumor suppressor, and HIF-1[alpha]-expressing cells have been shown to localize preferentially in vivo to regions near tumor vasculature. These differences were proposed to be due to increased hypoxia-induced apoptosis and growth arrest of HIF-1[alpha]-expressing ES cells. This thesis presents a careful investigation into the localization of ES cells in vitro and in vivo with respect to hypoxia. A sandwich culture system was utilized in which controlled gradients of oxygen and nutrients are developed in the vicinity of the tumor cells.

    "abstract": "Two different hemodynamic-based neuroimaging techniques were studied in this work. Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) is a promising technique to measure cerebral hemodynamics in a clinical setting due to its potential for continuous monitoring. However, the presence of strong systemic interference in the signal significantly limits our ability to recover the hemodynamic response without averaging tens of trials. Developing a new methodology to clean the NIRS signal from systemic interference and isolate the cortical signal would therefore significantly increase our ability to recover the hemodynamic response opening the door for clinical NIRS studies such as epilepsy. Toward this goal, a new method based on multi-distance measurements and state-space modeling was developed and further optimized to remove systemic physiological oscillations contaminating the NIRS signal. Furthermore, the cortical and pial contributions to the NIRS signal were quantified using a new multimodal regression analysis. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) based on the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) response has become the method of choice for exploring brain function, and yet the physiological basis of this technique is still poorly understood. Despite the effort, a detailed and validated model relating the signal measured to the physiological changes occurring in the cortical tissue is still lacking. Modeling the BOLD signal is challenging because of the difficulty to take into account the complex morphology of the cortical microvasculature, the distribution of oxygen in those microvessels and its dynamics during neuronal activation. Here, we overcome this difficulty by performing Monte Carlo simulations over real microvascular networks and oxygen distributions measured in vivo on rodents, at rest and during forepaw stimulation, using two-photon microscopy. Our model reveals for the first time the specific contribution of individual vascular compartment to the BOLD signal, for different field strengths and different cortical orientations. Our model makes a new prediction: the amplitude of the BOLD signal produced by a given physiological change during neuronal activation depends on the spatial orientation of the cortical region in the MRI scanner. This occurs because veins are preferentially oriented either perpendicular or parallel to the cortical surface in the gray matter.",

    "abstract": "Perceptual abnormalities such as hyperacusis and tinnitus often occur following acoustic overexposure. Although such exposure can also result in permanent threshold elevation, some individuals with noise-induced hyperacusis or tinnitus show clinically normal thresholds. Recent work in animals has shown that noise exposure can cause permanent degeneration of the cochlear nerve despite complete threshold recovery and lack of hair cell damage (Kujawa and Liberman, J Neurosci 29:14077-14085, 2009). Here we ask whether this noise-induced primary neuronal degeneration results in abnormal auditory behavior, indexed by the acoustic startle response and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of startle. Responses to tones and to broadband noise were measured in mice exposed either to a neuropathic exposure causing primary neuronal degeneration, or to a lower intensity, nonneuropathic noise, and in unexposed controls. Mice with cochlear neuronal loss displayed hyper-responsivity to sound, as evidenced by lower startle thresholds and enhanced PPI, while exposed mice without neuronal loss showed control-like responses. Gap PPI tests, often used to assess tinnitus, revealed spectrally restricted, as well as broadband, gap-detection deficits in mice with primary neuronal degeneration, but not in exposed mice without neuropathy. Crossmodal PPI tests and behavioral assays of anxiety revealed no significant differences among groups, suggesting that the changes in startle-based auditory behavior reflect a neuropathyrelated alteration specifically of auditory neural pathways. Despite significantly reduced cochlear nerve response, seen as reduced wave 1 of the auditory brainstem response, later peaks were unchanged or enhanced, suggesting neural hyperactivity in the auditory brainstem that could underlie the abnormal behavior on the startle tests. Taken together, the results suggest a role for cochlear primary neuronal degeneration in central neural excitability and, by extension, in the generation of tinnitus and hyperacusis.",

    "abstract": "More than 14,000 women in the United States die from ovarian cancer each year. The standard of care is tumor-debulking surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Combination intraperitoneal (IP) and intravenous (IV) chemotherapy has been shown to lengthen survival over IV therapy alone. Large-volume infusions, drug-associated toxicity, and catheter-associated complications, however, increase morbidity and limit patient adherence, often resulting in discontinuation of IP therapy. The technical skill required for catheter implantation and IP chemotherapy administration has also limited its clinical adoption. The proposed solution is an implantable IP device capable of localized drug delivery that maintains the efficacy of the standard of care and overcomes current clinical challenges. A reservoir-based device was developed to release cisplatin at a constant rate. In vivo studies demonstrated that continuous dosing reduces tumor burden to the same extent as weekly IP injections. The implanted device induced significantly less systemic toxicity compared to IP injections, despite administration of higher cumulative doses. A subsequent in vitro study revealed that greater tumor shrinkage following continuous cisplatin exposure was achieved with smaller tumor nodules. These results support that an implanted device would be maximally effective against microscopic residual disease. In vitro results also illustrated that a human-scale device fabricated from orifice-lined silicone can be designed to release cisplatin continuously at the desired rate. The promising preclinical results in this thesis highlight the potential for this novel IP dosing regimen to improve the treatment of late-stage ovarian cancer and set the stage for development of the proposed human device.",

We develop and assess performance metrics for use in the algorithm design process; such metrics make algorithm evaluation efficient, consistent, and subject independent. One promising performance metric is the Speech Transmission Index (STI), which is well correlated with speech reception by normal-hearing listeners for additive noise and reverberation. We expect the STI will effectively predict speech reception by CI users since typical CI sound-processing strategies, like the STI, rely on the envelope signals in frequency bands spanning the speech spectrum. However, STI-based metrics have proven unsatisfactory for assessing the effects of nonlinear operations on the intelligibility of processed speech. In this work we consider modifications to the STI that account for nonlinear operations commonly found in CI sound-processing and noise reduction algorithms. We consider a number of existing speech-based STI metrics and propose novel metrics applicable to nonlinear operations. A preliminary evaluation results in the selection of three candidate metrics for extensive evaluation. In four central experiments, we consider the effects of acoustic degradation, N-of-M processing, spectral subtraction, and binaural noise reduction on the intelligibility of CI-processed speech.

    "abstract": "In the past decade, thousands of human genomes have been catalogued, either by whole-genome sequencing or by targeted genotyping. The variability between human genomes encodes invaluable information about human traits and genetic diseases, as well as human migration patterns and population interactions. A key challenge is to understand and characterize the evolution of the variability between human genomes. In this thesis, I focus on studying human evolution through the use of microsatellites, which are simple repetitive sections of DNA of typically 1-6bp motifs (e.g. CACACACACA) that are highly polymorphic and highly mutable. The first aim is to establish that microsatellites are useful as reliable molecular clocks, such that its evolution highly correlates to time, especially when applied to the time range appropriate for human history. Using existing models of microsatellites, we examine microsatellite data from populations around the world to demonstrate that microsatellites are accurate molecular clocks for coalescent times of at least two million years. These results raise the prospect of using microsatellite data sets to determine parameters of population history. In order to calibrate genetic distances into time, the mutation rate must be known. This leads to the second aim, which is to directly measure the microsatellite mutation rate from largescale pedigree genetics data and provide a precision that is unprecedented. To do so, we use data from over 95,000 individuals in Icelandic pedigrees, genotyped in over 3000 microsatellite loci. Using trio and extended-family based approaches, we discover 2058 denovo mutations. In addition, we also attempt to capture many features that are covariates with the mutation rate, such as parental gender and age. The third aim takes our empirical observations of the microsatellite mutation process to build a new model of microsatellite evolution. This model improves upon the standard random walk model with features we have captured from aim 2. We use a Bayesian coalescent approach to provide a model that estimates the sequence mutation rate, European genetic divergence times, and human-chimpanzee speciation time.",

Previous work in this lab focused on creating a robust mix formulation to create these bricks, but they faced high water absorption and were not optimized under pressure molding conditions. The motivation for the work on alkali-activated bricks is based on the claim that they have a lower environmental burden, but this claim has not yet been verified for this formulation. Thus, this thesis focused on the effects of controlled testing of formation pressure and particle size distribution on brick performance and understanding the relative environmental impacts of clay fired bricks and alkali activated bricks. It was found that water absorption and compressive strength have a strong dependence on forming pressure, with 3-day compressive strengths ranging from 7MPa to 27MPa and water absorption from 35% to as high as 60% as forming pressure increased from 5 to 35Mpa. Sieving of the ash used in the bricks to control for particle size distribution had a minimal effect on performance, but the similarity is attributed to the fact that packing density within the selected particle size ranges were similar. Further testing on controlled mixing of particle sizes is needed to see if better performance can be obtained.

However, the precise mechanism and molecular basis of metastasis promotion by E-cadherin loss is not completely understood. To investigate its role in metastasis, I utilized two distinct methods of E-cadherin inhibition that distinguish between E-cadherin's cell-cell adhesion and intracellular signaling functions. While the disruption of cell-cell contacts alone does not enable metastasis in vivo, the loss of E-cadherin protein does, through induction of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasiveness and anoikis-resistance. E-cadherin binding partner f3-catenin is necessary but not sufficient for these phenotypes. In addition, gene expression analysis shows that E-cadherin loss results in the induction of multiple transcription factors, at least one of which, Twist, is necessary for E-cadherin loss-induced metastasis. These findings indicate that E-cadherin loss in tumors contributes to metastatic dissemination by inducing wide-ranging transcriptional and functional changes. In addition to promoting metastasis, loss of E-cadherin and the accompanying EMT renders cells resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs. As the cells that have undergone an EMT represent the pool of cancer cells most competent to metastasize and lead to tumor recurrence, it is of vital importance to find therapies that effectively target such cells.

The goal of this experiment is to use a general liquid-phase method to exfoliate and optimize a number of parameters that can yield the highest concentration of layered quantities of MoS₂, WS₂, and BN. The key parameters optmized were material concentration, surfactant concentration, sonication method and duration, and centrifuge speed. Therefore, different concentrations of the three materials were mixed with different concentrations of the surfactant, sodium cholate hydrate (C₂₄H₃₉NaO₅ · xH₂O), to make suspensions. These suspensions were then sonicated and centrifuged at different durations and speeds, respectively. Absorption was measured for all of the suspensions using ultraviolet-visible spectrometer to determine what parameters yielded the highest concentration of the three materials since a high UV absorption generally equated to a high yield of the layered materials. The final optimal parameters that yielded the highest concentration of each material were: 3 mg/ml material concentration, 3 mg/ml surfactant concentration, 30-minute continuous tip sonication method, and 1-hr 500 RPM centrifugation. Droplets of these optimal suspensions were then casted onto carbon nanofilms, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on the films to confirm the layered, flaked characteristics and the hexagonal structures of MoS₂, WS₂, and BN.",

The goal of this experiment is to use a general liquid-phase method to exfoliate and optimize a number of parameters that can yield the highest concentration of layered quantities of MoS₂, WS₂, and BN. The key parameters optmized were material concentration, surfactant concentration, sonication method and duration, and centrifuge speed. Therefore, different concentrations of the three materials were mixed with different concentrations of the surfactant, sodium cholate hydrate (C₂₄H₃₉NaO₅ · xH₂O), to make suspensions. These suspensions were then sonicated and centrifuged at different durations and speeds, respectively. Absorption was measured for all of the suspensions using ultraviolet-visible spectrometer to determine what parameters yielded the highest concentration of the three materials since a high UV absorption generally equated to a high yield of the layered materials. The final optimal parameters that yielded the highest concentration of each material were: 3 mg/ml material concentration, 3 mg/ml surfactant concentration, 30-minute continuous tip sonication method, and 1-hr 500 RPM centrifugation. Droplets of these optimal suspensions were then casted onto carbon nanofilms, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on the films to confirm the layered, flaked characteristics and the hexagonal structures of MoS₂, WS₂, and BN."

Recently, the Grossman Group used computation to show that nanotemplating of the azobenzene photoactivesystem improves problems with degradation. We believe that this could be a platform technology for other photoactive systems like azobenzene. We would like to use high throughput screenings to identify other promising photoactive molecules. We would like to use Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations for these studies, since DFT is the least computationally intense Quantum Mechanical model used on large chemical systems.

    "abstract": "The benefits of recycling have long been understood and the conspicuous energy savings of secondary aluminum production have caused aluminum recycling to increase. Obsolete aircraft are a valuable source of aluminum scrap and recent efforts to fortify the aerospace aluminum recycling infrastructure have drawn attention to the potential of sophisticated sorting methods to maximize the economic gain of using aerospace scrap in secondary production. The aim of this research was to use linear optimization to assess the economic viability of sorting technologies for enabling wrought products in general and aerospace alloys in particular to be recycled back to high value applications. A chance-constrained model was used to select the alloys that consumed the largest quantity of aerospace alloys in their production, thereby establishing a strategic portfolio of finished goods. Ten of the fifteen alloys in the portfolio were of the 2xxx and 7xxx alloy series that are standard in the production of aerospace components.

    "text": "Economic and environmental evaluation of end-of-life aerospace aluminum options using optimization methods The benefits of recycling have long been understood and the conspicuous energy savings of secondary aluminum production have caused aluminum recycling to increase. Obsolete aircraft are a valuable source of aluminum scrap and recent efforts to fortify the aerospace aluminum recycling infrastructure have drawn attention to the potential of sophisticated sorting methods to maximize the economic gain of using aerospace scrap in secondary production. The aim of this research was to use linear optimization to assess the economic viability of sorting technologies for enabling wrought products in general and aerospace alloys in particular to be recycled back to high value applications. A chance-constrained model was used to select the alloys that consumed the largest quantity of aerospace alloys in their production, thereby establishing a strategic portfolio of finished goods. Ten of the fifteen alloys in the portfolio were of the 2xxx and 7xxx alloy series that are standard in the production of aerospace components.

No where is this connection more apparent than with biomaterials, whose unparalleled properties are the result of the evolution via cumulative selection of highly specialized structures. Beyond biomaterials, cumulative selection offers a generalizable model for materials optimization via accumulative of beneficial mutations in a material's genome that improve the properties for a given function. A genetic algorithm is one method for applying the principals of cumulative selection to material's optimization. One of unique property that cumulative selection generated was the ability of trabecular bone to optimize and adjust its structure in vivo in response to changes in its loading conditions. This work presents a model for trabecular microstructure evolution using a genetic algorithm, the same mechanism through which that ability evolved. The algorithm begins by translating a trabecular genome into a developed structure. It then simulates the structure's response under an applied load and selects for the genome which translates into the best structure. The selected genome is then replicated and mutated. Simulations of microstructure evolution consist of iterating through this process across multiple generations. A series of simulations was conducted demonstrating the ability of the algorithm to improve trabecular architecture. The systems tended to converge to a uniform stress distribution, after which additional generations of evolution had no effect on performance.

Vertically-aligned carbon nanotubes (VA-CNTs) have been used in applications for electrochemical systems in energy storage systems and desalination systems. Typical methods of characterizing the morphology and composition of CNTs are limited in providing information on the packing density of CNTs, and therefore, an effective method for in situ characterization of VA-CNT electrodes is needed. This method explores the use of impedance spectroscopy and other electrochemical methods to characterize VA-CNTs in situ. VA-CNTs forests were grown via chemical vapor densification on pre-oxidized silicon wafers, mechanically densified to achieve varying volume fractions (1%, 2%, 5%, and 10%), and tested in a three-electrode electrochemical cell. Electrochemical techniques (cyclic voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy, and potentiostatic techniques) were used to measure the performance of the VA-CNTs in 1 M and 500 mM electrolyte solutions. Optimization of the experimental setup design and data collection methods yielded data that resulted in the expected cyclic voltammetry response and impedance behavior of porous electrodes. A transmission line model-pore size distribution (TLM-PSD) model was applied to the data collected in order to predict and model porosimetry characteristics. Porous behavior was observed in the VA-CNT electrodes of all volume fractions tested, and the impedance spectra showed that the volume fraction affected the overall impedance but not the characteristic shape of the spectra. Comparison between the impedance data collected in 1 M NaCl and 500 mM NaCl showed the expected corresponding inverse correlation with solution conductivity. Parameters that describe the VA-CNT electrode porosity were calculated and predicted using electrochemical data and the TLM-PSD model. The porous volume Vtot and total ionic conductance Yp values calculated using the model applied to the impedance spectroscopy data showed trends as expected for the different volume fractions of VA-CNT. The results show that electrochemical impedance spectroscopy can be used to characterize certain physical characteristics of the VA-CNT electrodes and further development of the model can yield insights into the porous geometry of VA-CNT forests.",

    "text": "Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to characterize vertically-aligned carbon nanotube forest porosimetry Carbon nanotubes have generated much research interest and potential applications due to their unique properties such as their high tensile strength, high thermal conductivity, and unique semiconductor properties. Vertically-aligned carbon nanotubes (VA-CNTs) have been used in applications for electrochemical systems in energy storage systems and desalination systems. Typical methods of characterizing the morphology and composition of CNTs are limited in providing information on the packing density of CNTs, and therefore, an effective method for in situ characterization of VA-CNT electrodes is needed.

    "abstract": "The study was conducted to characterize the effects of xanthan gum on gluten-free bread formulations. An improved gluten-free flour blend consisting of brown rice flour, quinoa flour, and sorghum flour was used with the aim of developing a gluten-free bread formulation comparable to traditional gluten-based bread and commercial gluten-free bread mix. Rheological measurements were taken to analyze the effects of xanthan gum on pre-baked dough formulations. Higher concentrations of xanthan gum were found to decrease the loss factor thus strengthening the elastic properties of the dough, elongating the linear viscoelastic region and increasing the viscosity of the dough. Furthermore, the xanthan gum samples were not independent of frequency and the loss factor decreased as frequency increased. Porosity of samples was also analyzed using imaging technology to determine the average pore size. Pore size increased as xanthan gum concentration increased indicating the ability for xanthan gum to retain gas during the proofing stage before baking. It was concluded that xanthan gum was necessary for a loaf with nice crumb texture, loaf color, and moisture content though different than gluten-based and commercial brand gluten-free bread mix. 0.3% xanthan gum concentration provided the most desirable post-baked crumb texture, loaf volume, and moisture content",

This study evaluates the prospects of aluminum sheets as a cost efficient alternative to steel in autobodies with the unibody design. The study focuses on the processing technologies and alloy selection for aluminum automotive sheets and looks at the impact of these on the total part forming cost of the unibody. Technical cost modeling was used to analyze the costs of traditional direct chill casting and subsequent rolling of aluminum alloy sheet and compared the technology to the alternative continuous casting fabrication method. A change to continuous casting displayed large potential cost savings and was believed to be crucial in order for aluminum to be competitive with steel. A large cost penalty is associated with the alloying and heat treatment of 6xxx series sheet for outer body panels as opposed to 5xxx series sheet for interior panels. Changes in production method for 6xxx series sheet or a replacement by 5xxx series sheet will have large impact on the cost of the autobody. The volatility in the price of aluminum ingot has a critical influence on the price of sheet. Changes in the price level have been shown to be equally critical for the final sheet cost as substantial technical improvements.

    "abstract": "There is a surprising lack of good models for granular flow. In 2002, Bazant proposed a new stochastic kinematic model of granular drainage from a silo. The new model rests on the notion that flow in the silo is caused by the migration of extended regions of excess interstitial space upward from the orifice at the bottom. An implementation of this model with the purpose of simulating the behavior of particles in the silo was developed by the author, and several results were obtained using simulations carried out with this implementation. As regards particle streamlines, average velocity profiles, predictions of particle mixing and of particle diffusivity, it was found that qualitative and quantitative agreement with experiments was excellent, in particular for a specific version of the implementation. This version uses a self-correlated random walk to describe the motion of the excess interstitial space through the silo. The model can also be used to make predictions about many other features of the granular flow (such as granular temperature), that are not as accessible through experiment's, and for which empirical behavior is not well known.

Contact configuration and angular dependence of applied field are also examined. Using submicron thickness rhombic rings with long axis dimension -1.5gjm, major loop magnetization sweeps were conducted, as well as minor loops in order to excite several resistance states within the devices. It was found from major loop applied field sweeps that rhombic multilayer rings exhibit five stable magnetoresistive states, with an additional state excited through execution of a minor loop field sweep. In addition, using the contact configurations known as \"classical\" and \"wheatstone bridge\" provide additional information on interactions that are occurring within the structures. It was found that both contact configurations were sensitive to similar changes in the devices, however, through different means of sensing. The major difference results in a larger GMR output in the wheatstone bridge configuration (-20%) versus the classical configuration (-1%).

    "abstract": "Injections of medicine into the body are commonplace, whether they be intravenous or capsules. The benefit of using a macroneedle for injecting cargo into the circulatory system is its simplicity. However, introduction of the needle intravenously can also include foreign matter if the needle is unsterile. Due to macroneedles ability to pierce skin and veins for effortless insertion, it can also damage unintentional areas if a patient resists the needle, or if it is poorly inserted. Thus the body can be subjected to undesirable materials beyond the intension medicine cargo. Current research reevaluates methods of introducing cargo medicine into the body. Popular models consider polymer substrates with different surface designs and medicine release. Thin polymer substrates allow flexible construction for adhering to tissue while specfic polymers with high Young's modulus create strength for rigidity. Cargo can be placed within or on top of the substrate itself for release to the epidermis or dermis in stages, which is difficult for both oral medicine and macroneedles. A spectic substrate system with microneedles can prevent irflammation or tear of the epidermis but still puncture for cargo release. Depending on the substrate contact surface area, a larger microneedle array can be utilized, for a higher success rate of release beyond individual microneedles. Microneedles can carry and release medicine either internally or externally through the epidermis. In the latter, Langerhans cells can be utilized for activating the immune system by releasing antigenes. Aims of this thesis show the effects of polymer microneedle substrates with methods for constructing the substrate arrays that are flexible adherent to the epidermis, rigid enough for puncturing the stratum corneum, but not weak enough to buckle or be brittle.",

However, introduction of the needle intravenously can also include foreign matter if the needle is unsterile. Due to macroneedles ability to pierce skin and veins for effortless insertion, it can also damage unintentional areas if a patient resists the needle, or if it is poorly inserted. Thus the body can be subjected to undesirable materials beyond the intension medicine cargo. Current research reevaluates methods of introducing cargo medicine into the body. Popular models consider polymer substrates with different surface designs and medicine release. Thin polymer substrates allow flexible construction for adhering to tissue while specfic polymers with high Young's modulus create strength for rigidity. Cargo can be placed within or on top of the substrate itself for release to the epidermis or dermis in stages, which is difficult for both oral medicine and macroneedles. A spectic substrate system with microneedles can prevent irflammation or tear of the epidermis but still puncture for cargo release. Depending on the substrate contact surface area, a larger microneedle array can be utilized, for a higher success rate of release beyond individual microneedles. Microneedles can carry and release medicine either internally or externally through the epidermis. In the latter, Langerhans cells can be utilized for activating the immune system by releasing antigenes. Aims of this thesis show the effects of polymer microneedle substrates with methods for constructing the substrate arrays that are flexible adherent to the epidermis, rigid enough for puncturing the stratum corneum, but not weak enough to buckle or be brittle."

The experiment detailed in this work shows the effect of thermal gradients on residual stresses in polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). A downhill quench from 95 C to 15C is able to create a deflection of 2.36 millimeters, evidence of residual stress. A subsequent uphill quench from -40 to 100 degrees reduced the deflection by 37 percent. The finite element simulation of a 6000 series aluminum block verifies that under properly controlled processing parameters, it is possible to induce opposite stresses to relieve residual stresses in a quenched material.

As they pursue incremental revenue and market share to meet corporate milestones, their, product portfolio grows and the overall complexity of the business increases. The holistic effects of this complexity across the supply chain are not fully understood, which can lead to inefficiencies in portfolio management and, ultimately, lower profitability for the division. Faced with this growing problem, the NACC division employed an HP internal consulting group to help quantify the costs and benefits of complexity in their business and to help establish decision-making guidelines to optimize future product cycles. This project involved three main phases: identification of complexity cost drivers in the retail consumer PC business, development of a quantitative model to calculate complexity effects, and suggestion of complexity guidelines for future portfolio planning.

    "abstract": "Many potentially powerful therapeutic strategies for the treatment of disease require the delivery of drugs into the cytosolic or nuclear compartments of cells. Members of the Irvine laboratory have developed a novel pH-responsive core-shell nanoparticle system that can achieve efficient and non-cytotoxic drug delivery into the cytosol. Another advantage is that the shell can be easily modified to bind to different types of drug agents and incorporate ligands for specific cell targeting. Experimental analysis of the newly synthesized nanoparticles with various shell structures has demonstrated that modification of the shell does not compromise their cytosolic delivery. These nanoparticles, if successful, will improve the therapeutic potential of a wide range of drugs. However, critical issues on the research side need to be resolved, and an appropriate intellectual property strategy should be initiated in the near future. Applications to siRNA delivery and vaccines have been examined in depth, as cytosolic delivery is one of the main challenges in these fields. Partnerships with large pharmaceutical companies are critical in order to acquire key patents on siRNA/antigen. Even though the market is competitive, there is a strong demand for innovative delivery platforms; provided that the overall profile of the core-shell nanoparticles is comparable to that of emerging drug delivery systems, and a strong intellectual property portfolio is developed, the Irvine technology should be able to compete in the market. After analyzing risks on the business side, including the FDA approval process, a suggested business strategy is outlined, through which value can be successfully obtained throughout the existing pharmaceutical supply chain from the novel drug delivery system.",

Of particular interest was the crack growth rate in these conditions. For that, tests were conducted at a constant stress intensity factor of 49.45 MPa'm (45 ksidinch) using a direct current potential drop measurement system to determine crack length. High purity argon gas allowed establishing an oxygen partial pressure as low as 10-22 atm and premixed oxygen/argon gases were used to vary the oxygen potential. To go dee er into the understanding of the phenomena involved, a creep test (constant load of 1.21x10 N in argon environment) and a corrosion experiment (50 ppm oxygen in argon for 500 hours without any load) were also added. The crack growth tests led to a particularly unexpected result: whatever the oxygen potential, the crack growth rate increased with time and the plot for the crack length versus time displayed a recurrent parabolic shape without any change in the environment. No unique crack growth rate could be defined in a given environment and the influence of the environment on the crack growth rate was not clearly visible. Multiple features were found to surround the main crack: secondary cracks parallel to the principal one, intergranular cracking ahead of the crack tip, wedge cracks at grain boundaries and aggregates of Cr-rich carbides near the lips of the crack. Moreover no extensive oxide scale was formed on the surface of the sample exposed to the corrosive environment (50 ppm oxygen in argon) for 500 hours. The non-constant crack growth rates, together with the observed cracking features, were attributed to the competition between creep deformation and mechanical fracture, likely environmentally enhanced. An exponential law was found to fit the data for the crack growth rate as a function of time for a K of 49.45 MPalm (45 ksi'inch). The effects of the environment were overcome by mechanical and thermal processes leading to damage accumulation and so, a reaction of alloy 617 to the external stress and temperature highly dependent on time.

The group's flagship company is Zara, which is the world's largest \"fast fashion\" company: through unique and carefully integrated design, manufacturing and distribution processes, Zara routinely achieves design-to-shelf leadtimes of 6 weeks against an industry average of 6 months, and introduces 11,000 references per season against an industry average of 3,000. Throughout the season, Zara currently ships every new incoming product to all 950 stores comprising its distribution network at the same time. Its operations group has recognized a large opportunity in customizing the assortment of products offered in each store based on local sales, and staggering shipments to stores of each new reference in order to acquire more accurate sales forecast and enable better subsequent inventory allocation decisions. My thesis will detail the development and implementation of new optimization models for dynamically allocating inventory across Zara's distribution network."

    "abstract": "Three Dimensional Printing (3DP™) is a manufacturing technique in which a powdered material is used to build parts with complicated geometries directly from a three dimensional computer model. This technique has been used in the past to manufacture metal parts with complicated geometries. The three different materials used in the making of tools by 3DP™ are binder, metal powder and the low melting infiitrant. The original material system used for hard tools is 420 martensitic stainless steel powder, a Cu-lOSn alloy as the infiltrant and acrysol as the binder. Although almost 50 tools have been manufactured using this materials system, there were several concerns which had to be dealt with, including dimensional control, porosity control, erosion and interaction between the skeleton and the infiltrant. Another requirement is a \"hardenable\" material system that is soft initially and that can be hardened after machining. This thesis describes the development of a new hardenable material system in which most of the concerns with the 420/bronze system are eliminated. The new material system that was selected uses a Mo powder skeleton and a 56Cu-22Ni- 22Mn infiltrant. The Cu-Ni-Mn alloy is age hardenable. Acrysol was retained as the binder material again. Experiments were carried out to study the printing, debinding/sintering and infiltration steps. An extra age hardening step was also introduced after infiltration. The process parameters for each of the steps were developed and several tools have been manufactured successfully. The thesis describes each of the post processing steps in detail with regards to experiments that were performed or literature that was obtained from past work.

An experimental study was conducted to determine how variations in solution chemistry (surfactant headgroup and blend stoichiometry) and solution conditions (pH and [NaCl]: [anionic + zwitterionic surfactant] ratio) affect the structure and rheology of surfactant solutions. This study examined binary systems of Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES) and Lauramidopropyl Betaine (LAPB) or SLES and Lauramidopropyl Hydroxysultaine (LAPHS) as well as ternary systems of SLES/LAPB/PEG-80 Sorbitan Laurate (PEG-80 SL) and SLES/LAPB/Polysorbite-20 (Tween-20).

In the SLES/LAPB system, it was found that there was a break in system viscosity at a critical [NaCl]: [anionic + zwitterionic surfactant] ratio, 0.16:1 (R*). Micelles only had the ability to entangle, thus increasing viscosity, above this ratio. When the system pH decreased such that pH ~ pKa of LAPB, all [NaCl]:[anionic + zwitterionic surfactant] ratios had the ability to entangle, and entanglement began at lower surfactant concentrations. At these pH values, LAPB protonated and created a pseudo-ternary system with SLES, LAPB0 , and LAPB*. There was no measured variation in system morphology in the SLES/LAPHS system with [NaCl]: [anionic + zwitterionic surfactant] ratio, most likely because the minimum ratio achievable was above R* due to a high salt content in the raw materials.

In the layers on which an Fe₂O₃ slurry was printed, the Fe composition of the layers increased on average to 72wt%. Similarly, the Ni composition of the Ni-enriched layers of the bars increased on average to 33wt%. The densification and local homogenization resulting from reduction and sintering treatments were not satisfactory."

    "abstract": "A series of case studies on raw materials inventory strategy for both wrought and cast aluminum alloy productions were conducted under recourse-based modeling framework with the explicit considerations of the demand uncertainty compared to the traditional strategy based on point forecast of future demand. The result shows significant economic and environmental benefits by pre-purchasing excess amount of cheaper but dirtier secondary raw materials to hedge the riskier higher-than-expected demand scenario. Further observations demonstrate that factors such as salvage value of residual scraps, cost advantage of secondary materials over primary materials, the degree of the demand uncertainty, etc. all have direct impacts on the hedging behavior. An analytical study on a simplified case scenario suggested a close form expression to well explain the hedging behavior and the impacts of various factors observed in case studies.

Currently, state-of-the-art white LEDs are made up of thin films of GaN and InGaN grown on sapphire substrates. A new LED structure design is proposed, in which GaN nanorod arrays are grown on silicon substrates. This new structure could be fabricated using anodized aluminum oxide's (AAO) ordered arrangement of pores as a template for growth of the nanorod array. AAO is selected for its high porosity and simple controllability of pore size and separation, which can in turn produce high density monocrystalline nanorod arrays with adjustable rod size and separation. Several advantages are enjoyed by LEDs based on rod arrays: lower cost, better yield and reliability and higher efficiencies. Two more LED designs, other than the current state-of-the-art GaN LED and the proposed LED structure, are included for comparisons. It is found that the proposed LED structure design is the best after considering costs and efficiency. For commercialization of this new LED design, the market penetration plan is to have a partnership with one of the major players in the current white LED industry.

This work describes the fabrication steps of the new package and a problem with the thermal bonding of Pyrex® frames preventing the achievement of a package true to the original design. A temporary solution was devised and the completed package was tested with regards to its intended goals.

    "abstract": "The past two decades have seen advancements in high temperature superconducting cables for use in applications such as electrical transmission lines, propulsion systems, and mobile power generation systems. This work describes the development of a non-fluorine precursor solution for YBCO films with high critical current densities (Jc). An aqueous nitrate precursor solution system was selected from three possible precursor solution systems. It was further developed to produce YBCO films with Jc > 1 MA/cm2. Films up to ~800 nm thickness were made, and Jc > 1 MA/cm2 was obtained for films of over ~400 nm thickness. The developed aqueous solution contained a rheology modifier (hydroxyethyl cellulose / HEC), nitrates of Y, Ba, and Cu, and chelating agents (polyethylene glycol / PEG and sucrose). The total organic content was ~12 wt% of the entire solution, and the total cation concentration was ~0.7 M. The rheology modifying polymer determined the thickness of the deposited films. This allowed for the deposition of films with higher thickness than would be dictated by the total dissolved cations alone. A low temperature decomposition process was developed based on analyses of the chemical reactions that take place in the precursor films as they were heated. This process produced smooth and defect-free intermediate films that were stable under ambient conditions. These films were then heat treated to convert them into YBCO films. Recommendations for future work include further improvements to the precursor solution, including more effective chelating agents and possible alternative solvent systems. Intermediate films thicker than 2.5 [mu]m still tended to have surface defects.",

In particular, there exist few methods by which the thermal, mechanical, and structural properties of materials may be monitored in conditions that are dynamically changing their microstructure.

To offset this lack of capability, new non-destructive experimental tools must be developed to facilitate on-line, realtime testing of materials undergoing some type of evolution. In this thesis, a flexible, all-optical methodology known as dual heterodyne phase collection transient grating spectroscopy is developed for this purpose. This method adapts a traditional spectroscopic technique sensitive to thermal and mechanical properties for real-time use. A formalism is also developed to quantify both elastic and thermal transport properties of materials with second-scale resolution. These new tools are then used to study the short-timescale oxidation kinetics of Fe-12Cr-2Si, a model alloy with oxide layer formation properties similar to large classes of Fr-Cr alloys. By monitoring the effect of thin oxide layers on surface thermal transport, there exists a pathway to continuously determine the thickness of a tens of nanometers thick growing oxide layer in real-time. Despite the lack of clarity in the particular set of experimental results presented here, the potential for the methods developed in this thesis is large.

Lastly, powertrain and market trend modeling are employed to estimate the value of the compounded mass savings in terms of improved fuel economy and acceleration.

In Dec, 2005, Intel and its partner, QinetiQ, Ltd, announced 85nm gate length enhancement and depletion mode InSb quantum well transistors.

The prospect of InSb transistor is also compared with other nanotechnology transistors, such as carbon nanotube and silicon nanowire. Several potential markets are figured out, namely, microprocessor, low noise amplifier and millimeter wave device. Related patents are evaluated. It is found that most of the patents are held by Intel's partner, QinetiQ Ltd. and thus patents issue would not block the launch of products.

Five key factors including power density, energy density, safety, durability, and cost are employed to compare four types of Li-ion batteries. Utility analysis indicates that all the Li-ion batteries are able to satisfy both power density and energy density targets, but only two of them are able to meet safety and durability requirements. Currently, the main challenge for their automotive application is cost reduction, since the cheapest LiFePO₄ battery costs $247.8/kWh which is 1.65 times the cost target established by USABC. Economical values of PHEV and BEV are presented from an end user's point of view. Various sensitivity analysis have been used to identify the impact of key factors such as battery pack cost reduction, driving distance, gasoline price, and government subsidizations on cost effectiveness of PHEV and BEV.

    "title": "Active hyperspectral imaging of chemicals on surfaces",
    "abstract": "Active hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a promising technique for the detection of chemicals at standoff distances. In active HSI, a target is illuminated by a laser source at many different wavelengths and a camera obtains an image of the illuminated scene at each wavelength. In this research, the feasibility of hyperspectral imaging for the detection of particles on surfaces was demonstrated using potassium chlorate particles on car panels at distances of 5 m, 10 m, and 20 m. Using the Adaptive Cosine Estimation (ACE) algorithm which compares the observed reflectance spectra to a reference spectrum, potassium chlorate fingerprints are easily visible at many different sample angles. However, in general, there is a large amount of variation in the shape and magnitude of spectra in a hyperspectral image that depend on factors such as particle size, viewing geometry, and surface reflectivity. Thus, Mie Theory calculations are performed on simulated materials and combined with information from sources such as Hapke [4], [20] to give qualitative insight into the expected shape and magnitude of reflectance spectra from sparse particles on a surface. The shape of the spectra depends on whether the particles are strongly absorbing or weakly absorbing. Strongly absorbing particles tend to have reflectance maxima near the resonant frequency, whereas weakly absorbing particles tend to have reflectance minima. For highly reflective substrates, the reflectance decreases sharply as the sample angle increases and becomes dominated by backward scattering from the particle which has a flatter spectrum around the Christiansen frequency, the frequency at which the refractive index of the particle is closest to one. The double interaction model, which uses Mie Theory to calculate the contributions to the reflectance along two different light paths, is used to accurately account for how the shape and magnitude of the reflectance spectra of sodium chlorate particles on gold and silica surfaces changes as a function of sample angle and laser angle. A method for approximating the mean particle size based on the location of the peak near the Christiansen frequency is derived. This method, when applied to the sodium chlorate sample, yields a result for the mean particle diameter that is approximately half of the value determined using a microscope. The Hapke Isotropic Multiple Scattering Approximation (IMSA), combined with Mie Theory, is used to give qualitative insight into the expected shape and magnitude of reflectance spectra from bulk powders. Compared with the reflectance spectra from sparse particles, the spectra from bulk powders are much simpler and less dependent on the viewing geometry. The Hapke IMSA model is able to accurately account for the observed changes in the reflectance from bulk sodium chlorate powder at multiple sample angles and laser angles. A final scenario of interest is thin films on rough or porous surfaces. Using a model that takes into account diffusely reflected and specularly reflected light, the observed reflectance spectra from diethyl phthalate (DEP) on a brick is fitted to a high degree of accuracy. This suggests a promising method for using hyperspectral imaging to determine the thickness of liquids on porous surfaces. Finally, the issue of speckle in hyperspectral imaging was examined using simulations based on Fourier optics and information from sources such as Goodman [6], [17]. Speckle is a limiting factor in hyperspectral imaging because it is noise that scales with the signal, and thus cannot be eliminated by increasing the signal strength. Equations from various sources are presented that describe the reduction in speckle contrast for spatial, spectral, polarization, temporal, and angular averaging.

    "abstract": "The unprecedented growth of the semiconductor industry is demanding ultra large-scale integrated (ULSI) circuits with increasing performance at minimum cost and power dissipation. As the critical dimensions in ULSI design continue to shrink, system performance of integrated circuits will be increasingly dominated by interconnect delay. Three-dimensional (3-D) ICs can reduce interconnect delay problems by offering flexibility in system design, placement and routing. 3-D ICs can be formed by vertical integration of multiple device layers using wafer bonding, recrystallization or selective epitaxial growth. The flexibility to place devices along the vertical dimension allows higher device density and reduced total interconnect lengths in 3-D ICs. One approach to fabrication of 3D integrated circuits is to bond previously-processed device layers using metal-metal bonds that also serve as layer-to-layer interconnects. Evaluation of the feasibility of wafer bonding for 3-D integration relies on our ability to characterize bonded interconnects. The reliability of devices containing multi-layer thin film structures is strongly influenced by the adhesion properties of the many interfaces present. Interface fracture failure is highly likely given the high thermal stresses developed during processing and also during service. A four-point bend test technique has been used to evaluate the strength of Cu-Cu bonds. Test structures were fabricated by bonding wafers containing copper lines (with Ta barrier) that were patterned on silicon dioxide. Tests on the thermocompression-bonded copper lines yielded reproducible fracture toughness values (1-10 J/m2 ) for bonds created at 300°C-400°C. The effect of process parameters on bond strength was studied. It was found that surface copper oxide removal prior to bonding using a forming gas purge (95%Ar-5%H2 ) resulted in higher toughness values and lesser variations compared to a N2 purge. Also, bond strength was found to increase with increasing bonding temperature. Thicker bonded films resulted in stronger bonds. Interface failure was found to be most likely at the Cu-Cu and Ta-Silicon dioxide interfaces. The results obtained from different process conditions were used to optimize the bonding process.",

This interval is unprecedented, as no known submarine shafting system is currently operated with this inspection cycle, nor are any known commercial vessel shafts. Experience and improved design have eliminated many threats to the life of a submarine shaft, but inspections of existing shafts show a high percentage with signs of wetting, leaving designers with less-than-acceptable confidence to approve this longer inspection interval due to the possibility of corrosion fatigue failure. This thesis uses probabilistic models from literature for pitting and cracking of wetted shafts, along with Monte Carlo simulations, to predict results of shafts inspections. Each possible water ingress distribution is analyzed by simulating shafts under 6 years of exposure to the water ingress, pitting, and cracking models in order to estimate the effects of corrosion fatigue. A water ingress distribution that predicts inspection results closest to actual inspection results is identified. Some information about water ingress is inferred from this distribution. Next, using the same literature models, a water ingress distribution that predicts similar performance at 12 years is identified. It is shown that the time a shaft is in service prior to becoming wetted must increase substantially. Predicted failure rates are low, but they are still higher than acceptable.

The porous alumina structure can be obtained from a simple electrochemical oxidation process, applying a positive voltage to an aluminum film placed in an electrolyte, and resulting in the formation of periodically arranged arrays of pores.

To understand this phenomenon, the microstructure and crystallographic characteristics of the overgrown Au and Pt nanowires were studied using SEM, TEM and XRD.

Pt nanowires grown in pores were also polycrystalline and had a [111] texture, but the grain size was much smaller than that of the Au. In contrast with Au, no change of texture or microstructure was observed when Pt grew out of pores. The structure change observed for Au involves nucleation of a new crystal with a (100) texture.

Using thermodynamic models, three different compositions (wt. %) of base alloys were chosen to accomplish this task: 50In-43.6Sn-6.4Bi (Tm = 110°C) and eutectic 50.9In-49.1Sn (Tm = 120°C) alloys were used for bonding at 125°C and a eutectic 48.3In-15.6Sn-36.1Bi (Tm = 60°C) alloy was used for bonding at 75°C. In addition, novel approaches to TLP bonding, including the addition of base material to the interlayer alloy and application of an electroless Ni diffusion barrier layer, were employed in an attempt to optimize this joining method. The LTTLP processes were assessed based on their abilities to produce joints with minimal thickness, high reflow temperatures, and good mechanical properties at room/elevated temperatures. It was found that interlayer alloys containing higher Bi contents produced the thinnest joints, with the 48.3In-15.6Sn-36.1Bi alloy producing joints on the order of 10 gm. Increases in nominal Cu composition of the interlayer alloy tended to form larger joints.

    "abstract": "Internal combustion (IC) engines are broadly utilized today. The friction caused by piston rings in IC engines contributes around 20% of the mechanical friction losses. The liner finish is the most critical parameter to define the tension and other design parameters of the piston rings for proper sealing. This work is focused on developing numerical approaches to generating liner finishes based on certain values of topology parameters. The generated surface is able to simulate the lubrication and dry contact behaviors of the original surface, so that the method is used to study the effects of various topology parameters on friction losses. First, methods to analyze, generate, test, and compare honed liner surfaces have been developed. The algorithm to analyze the topology parameters of honed surfaces is described.

    "text": "Numerically generating topology of the liner finish in internal combustion engines Internal combustion (IC) engines are broadly utilized today. The friction caused by piston rings in IC engines contributes around 20% of the mechanical friction losses. The liner finish is the most critical parameter to define the tension and other design parameters of the piston rings for proper sealing. This work is focused on developing numerical approaches to generating liner finishes based on certain values of topology parameters. The generated surface is able to simulate the lubrication and dry contact behaviors of the original surface, so that the method is used to study the effects of various topology parameters on friction losses. First, methods to analyze, generate, test, and compare honed liner surfaces have been developed. The algorithm to analyze the topology parameters of honed surfaces is described. The honed surfaces are numerically generated and compared with the experimental data. Moreover, the topological variables are changed and the corresponding friction behaviors are studied.

    "abstract": "Growth of polycrystalline films involves poorly understood kinetic processes that occur far from equilibrium and lead to complex co-evolution of the surface, microstructure and intrinsic stress of the films. Here we present a comprehensive study consisting of in situ stress measurements, microstructure characterization, and analytical modeling for various polycrystalline systems. We find that in systems of high atomic mobility, the stress change after polycrystalline film growth can be attributed to a fast reversible surface process and a slow irreversible bulk process. The fast process is weakly dependent on temperature and is associated with changes in the shape of grain surfaces. The slow process is strongly dependent on temperature and is mostly associated with grain growth in the bulk of the film. We also discovered a turnaround phenomenon in which, under conditions of intermediate atomic mobility, the stress evolves from a tensile toward a compressive state, and then turns around to evolve toward a tensile state. This stress turnaround phenomenon is strongly dependent on the substrate temperature and deposition rate, and can be attributed to an increase of the grain size during film deposition. Grain growth during deposition not only leads to a tensile component of the intrinsic stress, but also changes the grain size dependence of the compressive component. The compressive component results from incorporation of excess adatoms in grain boundaries, and the magnitude of the compressive stress is controlled by a competition between adatom incorporation in 2D islands and incorporation at grain boundaries. We also investigated the effect of the angle of incidence of the flux of depositing atoms on stress and structure evolution during polycrystalline film growth. We find that as the angle of incidence increases, the coalescence thickness increases and the stress becomes less compressive or more tensile. We attribute these phenomena to the enhanced surface roughness, the shadowing effect, the steering effect and the presence of Ehrlich-Schwoebel barriers during oblique angle deposition. All these effects lead to suppression of the adatom-grain boundary incorporation process. Based on this thesis work, intrinsic stresses in polycrystalline films can be categorized into three types: Type I, the intermediate type and Type II. These behaviors are observed in systems of low, intermediate and high atomic mobility, respectively. Compressive stresses develop in Type II behavior and tensile stresses develop in Type I behavior. The transition of the stress behavior from Type I, to the intermediate type and to Type II is continuous and can be achieved by adjusting deposition conditions. Whether the post-coalescence stress is tensile, or compressive, or evolving from compressive to tensile depends on the homologous temperature, the deposition rate and the angle of the incidence of the flux of depositing atoms.",

This involves alternately dipping a substrate into dilute aqueous solutions of a positively charged polyelectrolyte followed by a negatively charged polyelectrolyte, with a rinsing step in between. By repeating this process an arbitrary number of times, a thin film can be built up due to the electrostatic interaction between the two oppositely charged polyelectrolytes. This technique was used to create thin film electroluminescent devices based on poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) using a water soluble precursor to PPV and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA). The structure of such films has been shown to be highly dependent on the conditions of the dipping solutions. The pH of the solutions controls the degree of ionization of the PAA which influences the deposition process by affecting both the conformation of the PAA in solution as well as the charge density of the PAA on the surface. These films exhibited a light output of greater than 1000 cd/m 2 (about 10 times the brightness of a computer monitor), significantly higher than that typically reported for films of pure PPV. A time dependent charging process together with a reduction in the turn-on voltage with charging, and a non-rectifying device behavior, suggest an electrochemical mode of operation. In such a case, ions present in the film play an active role by modifying the electrical injection characteristics.

    "abstract": "Lithium manganese oxides have attracted wide attention as low-cost, nontoxic intercalation cathode materials for rechargeable lithium batteries. In this work, the stability of these compounds during synthesis and in use has been studied in several respects. (1) Phase stability of LiMnO2 polymorphs has been determined under the high temperature synthesis conditions. Effects of temperature, oxygen partial pressure, and dopant (Al) content on the phase stability have been discussed based on a possible stability mechanism. (2) The mechanism of improved cycling stability of electrochemically transformed spinel compared to conventional spinel has been identified. Atomic rearrangement from the ordered rocksalt to spinel type cation ordering results in an antiphase nanodomain structure, which becomes a ferroelastic domain structure during the cubic ---> tetragonal Jahn-Teller transformation, and thereby accommodates the transformation strains. (3) Al-doped spinels exhibit much improved capacity stability at elevated temperatures compared to undoped spinels. This effect has been discussed with respect to proposed mechanisms of Mn dissolution and capacity loss. (4) Magnetic properties are critically influenced by phase stability, cation ordering, and Mn valence in lithium manganese oxides. In the paramagnetic temperature regime, it has been observed that antiferromagnetic interactions between the Mn ions are strongest in the orthorhombic phase among LiMnO2 polymorphs having the average Mn valence of 3+, while decreasing Mn valence strengthens the antiferromagnetic interactions in LixMn2O4 spinel. At temperatures below the paramagnetic temperature regime, spin-glass behavior is observed in both LixMn2O4 and monoclinic LiMnO2 compounds, which is attributed to geometrical frustration due to structure ( cation ordering) and magnetic disorder due to a disordered distribution of Mn valence. As spin-glass behavior is commonly observed in both well-crystallized, conventional spinel and highly disordered, transformed spinel, magnetic characterization cannot easily be used to distinguish the two different spinels.",

    "abstract": "Interfaces are ubiquitous in crystalline materials and they predominantly govern the properties of metals at nanoscale. Free energy is the most significant characteristic of an interface that determines its behavior and other properties. However, interfaces have an internal structure with nanoscale features that gives the interface free energy, a location dependent variation. The interface free energy is also expected to depend on temperature, especially for entropy stabilized phases such as liquids. I present methods for calculating location-dependent energies for solid-state interfaces and temperature-dependent free energies for solid/liquid interfaces using atomistic models. I demonstrate these methods on CuNbHe and AlGa models due to the importance of location- and temperature-dependence of interface energies in these systems. My analysis sheds light on interfacial He precipitation in CuNb composites and on Ga permeation through grain boundaries (GB) in Al. Based on the Gibbsian definition of excess interface energy, I develop a method to compute location dependent energy of solid/solid interface from atomic level energies and apply it to characterize four different Cu/Nb interfaces and several GBs of Al. The solid-state interface energies are indeed location-dependent and vary at the length scale of few nanometers. For any particular interface, the variation in the energies spans a range of ś100% of its average energy. The higher energy regions correspond to the underlying misfit dislocation network of the semicoherent interfaces. I compute the stress of solid/liquid interface from capillary pressure of the interface using the Young-Laplace equation and then derive its free energy. Applying this method to Cu/He and Nb/He interfaces, I find that these interface energies are dependent on He pressure and interface curvature but not explicitly on temperature. I fit analytical expressions for these interface free energies and study the impact of their curvature dependence on He cluster growth. For instance, the incorporation of curvature dependence of metal-He interface free energies accounts for a decrease of up to 1GPa in the pressure required to punch out a dislocation from the bubble into the metal. Al/Ga interface energy is found to be negative, implying that Ga can spread on all Al surfaces and GBs. The computed interface energies may be used to predict the distribution of He precipitates at CuNb interfaces while interface energies for AlGa shed light on the crystallographic character-dependence of Ga permeation through Al GBs. These results may be directly incorporated into phase field models of He behavior in CuNb composites and Ga behavior at Al GBs.",

Although various polymers and material forms have been explored, there is a need for: injectable gels that meet certain design specifications; a more indepth characterization of the scaffold properties; and a deeper understanding of the relation of select properties to cellular behavior, to provide a rational basis for future in vivo studies. The first objective of this thesis was to develop and characterize novel injectable biopolymer hydrogels capable of safely undergoing covalent cross-linking in vivo to provide a mechanically tunable nanofibrillar scaffold. Soluble type I collagen gels with genipin and transglutaminase cross-linkers, and gelatin-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid (Gtn-HPA) gels, the cross-linking of which are modulated by horse radish peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide, were investigated. The gels were characterized on the basis of rheological properties, resistance to degradation, and effects on stem cell behavior. Another objective was to evaluate the simultaneous differentiation of embryonic carcinoma cells (ECCs) incorporated in the gels into the three cell types in cardiac tissue -- cardiomyocytes, neural cells, and vascular endothelial cells -- and to determine the effects of certain properties of the gels on the differentiation profile, using mesenchymal stem cells as a comparative control. The injectable collagen-genipin and Gtn-HPA gels were found to be mechanically tunable hydrogel systems that supported cell encapsulation and proliferation at safe concentrations of the respective cross-linking agents. ECCs cultured as embryoid bodies (EBs) incorporated in the collagen-genipin and Gtn-HPA gels differentiated into cardiac, neural, and endothelial cells and combinations thereof, demonstrating the capability of EBs to express multiple cell lineages within the same EB. EBs cultured in collagen gels without cross-linkers and collagen gels with 0.25 mM genipin exhibited the highest differentiation efficiency compared to those cultured in monolayer, sponge-like scaffolds, and Gtn-HPA gels. The differentiation medium and culture time also had significant effects on differentiation efficiency. Notable findings included: the increased expression of neural and endothelial markers in EBs cultured in in mixed medium conditions compared to those cultured in neural or endothelial differentiation medium alone, and the correlation between angiogenic and neurogenic differentiation in the EBs in the non-cross-linked collagen gels for all media. Collectively, these findings show promise in using collagen gels cross-linked with 0.25 mM genipin, incorporated with EBs, for cellular therapy in cardiac tissue engineering applications.",

Implementation of the proposed NDT methodology significantly increases the feasibility of a retirement-forcause (RFC) approach to be applied to aging structural components in a cost-effective manner."

    "abstract": "Despite having a broad set of desirable properties, silicon's potential as a primary constituent in a structural material has not yet been realized because of its extremely low fracture toughness. Motivated by the microstructural design techniques used in toughening inherently brittle ceramic materials, this work aims to develop a silicon-rich alloy with microstructural features that provide for the same types of toughening mechanisms displayed by technical ceramics. In order to add true commercial value to these silicon-based alloys, however, the alloys must be processed using methods more flexible and less expensive than the powder processing routes currently used for engineering ceramics. This thesis will discuss the development of a class of castable silicon-based alloys referred to as silicon-disilicide (Si-XSi2) composites, which naturally form a microstructure composed of a silicon matrix and reinforcing disilicide (XSi2) phase during solidification (where X is a transition metal). Experimental work is performed to characterize the thermal, microstructural, and fracture properties of a specific set of Si-(Cr,V)Si2 alloys which are based on the Si-CrSi2-VSi2 system. First, a reliable thermodynamic description of the Si-CrSi2-VSi2 system is obtained, from which the relevant phase diagram is determined. Comparison between simulated solidification paths and experimentally observed microstructures demonstrates the use of the thermodynamic database to predict the phase evolution of the alloys during processing. Long-crack fracture toughness measurements made through chevron-notched beam (CNB) tests show that the toughness of the composite alloys are over 2-3 times that of unalloyed silicon, with in-situ tests revealing the role of microstructural toughening (via crack deflection and crack bridging) on the enhanced fracture properties. Ball-on-disk experiments reveal an order of magnitude improvement in the wear resistance of the alloys compared to silicon. This enhanced short-crack response is linked to the fine microstructural size scale of the eutectic structures, which allow toughening mechanisms to be activated during very early stages of crack growth. The range of fracture toughness and wear resistance values measured for the Si-(Cr,V)Si2 alloys elucidates the potential of these materials as viable structural materials in place of powder-processed ceramics.",

This is an inherently difficult problem for materials scientists: typically,we define structure-property relationships in terms of scalar material properties, such that modifying a material's structure affects a target material property. However, if the property of interest is function-valued, modifying the material's structure may affect different parts of the material function in undesirable ways. The increased dimensionality of the target material property therefore renders the overall materials design problem for soft materials significantly more difficult. Recently, transient interactions have been shown to vastly improve the mechanical properties of soft materials by providing increased energy dissipation through the dissociation of the reversible bonds. However, there is a wide variety of transient interactions to choose from, varying widely in binding strength, kinetics, specificity, and stoichiometry of the groups that form the association. More research needs to be done to identify what physical laws apply universally across the types of transient associations, and what differentiates the abilities of different types of interactions to control material mechanics. In this thesis,we show how transient metal-coordinate bonds inspired by the chemistry of the mussel byssal threads can be used to engineer viscoelastic material functions in an intuitive and facile manner.

In the final part of this thesis, we extend our control over the viscoelastic material functions of hydrogels by exploiting the redox-sensitivity of histidine:metal crosslinks.

    "abstract": "This thesis focuses on the understanding and engineering of a molecule known as azobenzene which holds unique properties for thermal storage applications. The azobenzene molecule undergoes structural change into a metastable state which has the ability to store energy. This thesis utilizes the energy storage and structural change properties of this molecule to develop new materials for thermal energy storage. The first is through a concept called solar thermal fuel which is storing the solar energy in rearranged bonds of the azobenzene and later releasing that energy in the form of heat. The second approach is through the structural property difference of its two states in order to moderate the phase change temperature of organic phase change materials. Essentially, the molecule azobenzene was modified and engineered to be used as a thermal battery as well as to mediate thermal energy storage in other materials. The first chapter will give a brief introduction on the concept and past examples of solar thermal fuel. Chapter 2, 3, 4 will discuss about the development of solar thermal fuel while chapter 5 discusses about a recently developed concept of using azobenzene to moderate phase change temperature. Chapter 2 shows the first demonstration of using solar thermal fuel in the solid state through functionalizing azobenzene on a polymer template. The polymer platform allows fabrication of a thin film of this material which enabled charging, discharging, and heat release using optically chargeable molecules all within the solid-state. A demonstration of solid state application was shown by constructing a macroscopic device which resulted in heat release bringing a temperature increase of as high as 10 OC. Next in chapter 3, azobenzene was engineered on the molecular lever with bulky aromatic groups (phenyl, biphenyl, and tert-butyl phenyl groups). The molecules were designed and synthesized for the purpose of increasing energy stored while promoting solid state solar thermal fuels. The design allowed fabrication of molecular based thin film, which was able to be charged with light, a great improvement from the original azobenzene, which crystallized preventing switching in the solid state. Molecular engineering proved to be a powerful and effective method in improving other solar thermal fuel properties, such as energy storage in STFs, chargeability, and also the thermal stability of the molecular thin film. In chapter 4, new diacetylene derivatives with azobenzene moieties and with varied alkyl spacers and linkers were synthesized to show photocontrolled self-assembly and disassembly of photon energy storage materials. This azobenzene decorated diacetylenes not only allowed solar energy storage but also demonstrated phase change characteristic of organic materials can be a parameter to consider in terms of designing high energy density photon energy storage materials. Chapter 5 discusses azobenzene based dopants in organic phase change material to photomoderate the phase change temperature. Three different types, 8 in total, organic phase change materials were tested to show the possibilty of this concept in a wide variety of phase change materials.

    "abstract": "The ability to investigate materials systems at the resolution of individual atoms makes computational simulations a powerful tool for the study of materials phenomena. However, microstructural evolution in complex materials is only meaningfully characterized in laboratory or industry applications by deformation rate and relevant rate coefficients, quantities that require sampling over a timescale too large for traditional atomistic methods to probe.

    "abstract": "Bombardier beetles possess one of the most remarkable defense mechanisms in nature, using explosions inside their bodies to synthesize and eject a hot, noxious spray at attackers. The chemical reactions that enable this process are well understood, but many aspects of the beetles' two-chambered defensive glands, which house the explosions and produce the defensive spray, remain unexplored. In this Thesis, I describe our recent progress in understanding the operation, structure, and materials composition of the defensive glands-topics which have to date received little treatment in the literature-of the best-known bombardier beetles, the brachinines (Carabidae: Brachininae: Brachinini). Chapter 2 deals with the pulsed-jet character of brachinines' sprays, which is in contrast to all other types of bombardier beetles that emit their sprays as continuous streams. Brachinine sprays comprise a number of spray pulses emitted in a rapid sequence, each pulse formed in a discrete explosion event inside the reaction chamber of the defensive gland, with the frequency of pulsation ranging from 300 to 1000 Hz. Using a combination of high-speed synchrotron x-ray phase-contrast imaging of live beetles, anatomical studies of the excised defensive glands, and mathematical analyses, we determined that spray pulsation arises due to explosion-induced displacement of the inlet structures to the reaction chamber periodically cutting o the ow of reactant solution into the reaction chamber. In Chapter 3, the interior cuticular microsculpture of the reaction chamber is studied using scanning electron microscopy and synchrotron x-ray phase-contrast microtomography. The microscupture is found to be highly complex, with a number of distinct spiny microtextures localized to specific regions of the reaction chamber. Quantitative details of the spine lengths and spacings are reported, and on the basis of the similarity of some of the features to the beetles' external abdominal microscupture and the micro-textural transitions observed inside the reaction chamber, we hypothesize that the reaction chamber microsculpture is homologous with the exterior microsculpture, consistent with the fact that the defensive glands are invaginations of the abdomen. Chapter 4 reports our preliminary investigations of the materials composition of the defensive glands. We use scanning electron microscopy to examine the fibrous composite structure of the gland cuticle and employ various light microscopy techniques to understand spatial variations in the cuticle sclerotization and chemical composition. The reaction chamber is found to exhibit dramatic spatial variation in sclerotization, including several lightly sclerotized regions, and possible functions of these regions are proposed. Additionally, the inter-chamber valve is found to contain the rubber-like protein resilin, likely as an adaptation to allow the valve to consistently make and hold a tight seal during each explosion, in analogy to rubber gaskets used in technological valve applications.",

Recent advances in the development of new thiophosphate electrolytes have reenergized the field by achieving room temperature conductivities exceeding those liquid electrolytes, but a number of practical challenges to their widespread adoption still exist. This thesis applies ab initio computational methods based on density functional theory to investigate the structural origins of high conductivity in ionic conductor materials and provides a thermodynamic explanation of why the integration of these newly developed thiophosphates into high-rate cells has proven difficult in practice, often resulting in high interfacial resistance. As a result of these computational investigations, we report the prediction and synthesis of a new high performance sodium-ion conducting material: NaioSnP 2S 12, with room temperature ionic conductivity of 0.4 mS cm-1, which rivals the conductivity of the best sodium sulfide solid electrolytes to date. We computationally investigate the variants of this compound where Sn is substituted by Ge or Si and find that the latter may achieve even higher conductivity. We then investigate the relationship between anion packing and ionic transport in fast Li-ion conductors, finding that a bcc-like anion framework is desirable for achieving high ionic conductivity, and that this anion arrangement is present in a disproportionately high number of known Li-conducting materials, including Na10SnP2S12 and its structural analog Li10GeP2S2 . Using this bcc anion lattice as a screening criterion, we show that the I4 material LiZnPS4 also contains such a framework and has the potential for very high ionic conductivity. While the stoichiometric material has poor ionic conductivity, engineering of its composition to introduce interstitial lithium defects is able to exploit the low migration barrier of the bcc anion structure. Thermodynamic calculations predict a solid-solution regime in this system that extends to x = 0.5 in Li1+2xZn-xPS 4 , thus it may yield a new ionic conductor with exceptionally high lithium-ion conductivity, potentially exceeding 50 mS cm- 1 at room temperature. Finally, we develop a computational methodology to examine the thermodynamics of formation of resistive interfacial phases through mixing of the electrode and electrolyte. The results of the thermodynamic model of interfacial phase formation are well correlated with experimental observations and battery performance, and predict that thiophosphate electrolytes have especially high reactivity with high voltage oxide cathodes and a narrow electrochemical stability window.

    "abstract": "Semiconductor nanostructures exhibit distinct properties by virtue of nano-scale dimensionality, allowing for investigations of fundamental physics and the improvement of optoelectronic devices. Nanoscale morphological variations can drastically affect overall nanostructure properties because the investigation of nanostructure assemblies convolves nanoscale fluctuations to produce an averaged result. The investigation of individual nanostructures is thus paramount to a comprehensive analysis of nanomaterials. This thesis focuses on the study of individual GaAs, AlGaAs, and ZnO nanostructures to understand the influence of morphology on properties at the nanoscale. First, the diameter-dependent exciton-phonon coupling strengths of individual GaAs and AlGaAs nanowires were investigated by resonant micro-Raman spectroscopy near their direct bandgaps. The one-dimensional nanowire architecture was found to affect exciton lifetimes through an increase in surface state population relative to volume, resulting in Fröhlich coupling strengths stronger than any previously observed. Next, ZnO nanowire growth kinetics and mechanisms were found to evolve by altering precursor concentrations. The cathodoluminescence of nanowires grown by reaction-limited kinetics were quenched at the nanowire tips, likely due to point defects associated with the high Zn supersaturation required for reaction-limited growth. Further, cathodoluminescence was quenched in the vicinity of Au nanoparticles, which were found on nanowire sidewalls due to the transition in growth mechanism, caused by excited electron transfer from the ZnO conduction band to the Au Fermi level. Finally, ZnO nanowalls were grown by significantly increasing precursor flux and diffusion lengths over that of the ZnO nanowire growth. Nanowall growth began with the Au-assisted nucleation of nanowires, whose growth kinetics was a combination of Gibbs- Thomson-limited and diffusion-limited, followed by the domination of non-assisted film growth to form nanowalls. Nanoscale morphological variations, such as thickness variations and the presence of dislocations and Au nanoparticles, were directly correlated with nanoscale variations in optical properties. These investigations prove unequivocally that nanoscale morphological variations have profound consequences on optical properties on the nanoscale.

    "abstract": "The use of compound semiconductor heterostructures to create electron confinement has enabled the highest frequency and lowest noise semiconductor electronics in existence. Modem technology uses two-dimensional electron gasses and there is considerable interest to explore one-dimensional electron confinement. This thesis develops the materials science toolkit needed to fabricate, characterize, and control the compositional, structural and electronic properties of core-shell GaAs/AlGaAs nanowires towards studying quasi-one-dimensional confinement and developing high mobility electronics First, nanowire growth kinetics were studied to optimize nanowire morphology. Variations in nanowire diameter were eliminated by understanding the role Ga adatom diffusion on sidewall deposition and vertical growth was enabled by understanding the importance of Ga and As mass-transport to nanowire nucleation. These results demonstrate that arrays of vertically-aligned GaAs nanowires can be produced. Then, the deposition of epitaxial AlGaAs shells on GaAs nanowires was demonstrated. By reducing the nanowire aerial density the stability of the nanowire geometry was maintained. A variety of analytical electron microscopy techniques confirmed the shell deposition to be uniform, epitaxial, defect-free, and nearly atomic sharp. These results demonstrate that core-shell nanowires possess a core-shell interface free of many of the imperfections that lithographically-defined nanowires possess. Finally, the adverse effect of the Au seed nanoparticle during n-type doping was identified and n-type doping was achieved via the removal of the Au nanoparticle prior to doping. A combination of energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, current-voltage, capacitance-voltage, and Kelvin probe force microscopy demonstrated that if the Au seed nanoparticle is present during the shell deposition, Au diffuses from the seed nanoparticle and creates a rectifying IV behavior. A process was presented to remove the Au nanoparticle prior to shell deposition and was shown to produce uniform n-type doping.

    "text": "Controlled growth and doping of core-shell GaAs-based nanowires The use of compound semiconductor heterostructures to create electron confinement has enabled the highest frequency and lowest noise semiconductor electronics in existence. Modem technology uses two-dimensional electron gasses and there is considerable interest to explore one-dimensional electron confinement. This thesis develops the materials science toolkit needed to fabricate, characterize, and control the compositional, structural and electronic properties of core-shell GaAs/AlGaAs nanowires towards studying quasi-one-dimensional confinement and developing high mobility electronics First, nanowire growth kinetics were studied to optimize nanowire morphology. Variations in nanowire diameter were eliminated by understanding the role Ga adatom diffusion on sidewall deposition and vertical growth was enabled by understanding the importance of Ga and As mass-transport to nanowire nucleation. These results demonstrate that arrays of vertically-aligned GaAs nanowires can be produced. Then, the deposition of epitaxial AlGaAs shells on GaAs nanowires was demonstrated. By reducing the nanowire aerial density the stability of the nanowire geometry was maintained. A variety of analytical electron microscopy techniques confirmed the shell deposition to be uniform, epitaxial, defect-free, and nearly atomic sharp. These results demonstrate that core-shell nanowires possess a core-shell interface free of many of the imperfections that lithographically-defined nanowires possess. Finally, the adverse effect of the Au seed nanoparticle during n-type doping was identified and n-type doping was achieved via the removal of the Au nanoparticle prior to doping. A combination of energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, current-voltage, capacitance-voltage, and Kelvin probe force microscopy demonstrated that if the Au seed nanoparticle is present during the shell deposition, Au diffuses from the seed nanoparticle and creates a rectifying IV behavior. A process was presented to remove the Au nanoparticle prior to shell deposition and was shown to produce uniform n-type doping. The conductivity of GaAs/n-GaAs nanowires was calculated as a function of donor concentration and geometric factors taking into account the effects of Fermi level pinning. The control demonstrated over all of these parameters is sufficient enough for core-shell nanowires to be considered candidates for high mobility electronics."

    "title": "Theoretical advancements towards understanding crystalline metastability during materials synthesis",
    "abstract": "Predicting the conditions in which a compound adopts a metastable structure when it crystallizes out of solution is an unsolved and fundamental problem in materials synthesis, and one which if understood and harnessed, could enable the rational design of synthesis pathways towards or away from metastable structures. Although metastable phases are ubiquitous in both nature and technology, only a heuristic understanding of their underlying thermodynamics and formation mechanisms exists. In this thesis, we aim to address two important outstanding questions regarding the fundamental nature of metastability: Which metastable phases can form? Under which conditions will they form? We will employ a variety of computational and theoretical approaches to elucidate quantitative insights to these two questions. To better predict which metastable materials can be made, we first seek to understand the metastable materials that have been made. We data-mine the Materials Project, a high-throughput database of DFT-calculated energetics of ICSD structures, to explicitly quantify the energy scale of metastability for 29,902 inorganic crystalline phases. We reveal the influence of chemistry and composition on the accessible range of crystalline metastability, and identify motifs characteristic of highly metastable compounds. We further assert that not all low-energy metastable materials can necessarily be made, and argue for a concept of \"remnant metastability\" - that observable metastable phases are remnants of thermodynamic conditions where they were once the lowest free-energy phase. Recently, exciting thermochemistry experiments have demonstrated that for many compounds, as metastability of a phase increases, its surface energy decreases. This effect is significant enough to trigger a reversal of relative phase stability in nanoparticles. Because nucleation and growth starts at the nanoscale, we hypothesize that the direct precipitation of metastable phases during crystallization may be 'remnant metastability' of size-dependent nanoscale phase stability. We develop algorithms for the automated, efficient, and high-throughput calculation of surface energies via DFT. We combine these algorithms with prior theoretical frameworks to predict solid-aqueous equilibria, enabling the calculation of nucleation barriers of competing polymorphs as a function of solution chemistry, thereby predicting the solution conditions governing polymorph selection. We apply this approach to resolve the long-standing 'Calcite-Aragonite Problem' - the observation that calcium carbonate precipitates as the metastable aragonite polymorph in marine environments, rather than the stable phase calcite - which is of tremendous relevance to biomineralization, carbon sequestration, paleogeochemistry, and the vulnerability of marine life to ocean acidification. We identify a direct relationship between the calcite surface energy and solution Mg/Ca ion concentrations, showing that the calcite nucleation barrier surpasses that of metastable aragonite in solutions with Mg/Ca ratios consistent with modern seawater, allowing aragonite to dominate the kinetics of nucleation. Our ability to quantify how solution parameters distinguish between polymorphs marks an important step towards the ab initio prediction of materials synthesis pathways in solution.",

    "abstract": "By means of quantitative metallography and electrical resistance measurements, the incubation period (time to form a detectable amount of martensite) and the initial nucleation rate have been determined as a function of subzero reaction temperature and austenitic grain size in three iron-nickel manganese alloys containing 23-25 percent nickel, 2-3 percent manganese and 0.02-0.04 percent carbon. The isothermal martensitic transformation in these alloys has been found to occur over a wide temperature range of at least -1960 to -200 C, and the martensitic structure over the entire range is body centered cubic. The incubation period and nucleation rate as a function of reaction temperature at various austenitic grain sizes show typical C-curve kinetics. The true initial nucleation rate (not the apparent initial nucleation rate during the incubation period) is independent of grain size, and so the effect of grain size on the incubation period arises merely because of the size of the first-formed plates. Accordingly, it may be concluded that grain boundaries do not predominate as preferred nucleation sites for the martensitic transformation in the alloys studied. Calculations of the relevant thermodynamic functions indicate that 1 atomic percent manganese is thermodynamically equivalent to 1.6 atomic percent nickel in the driving force for the martensitic transformation. However, alloys of equivalent thermodynamic driving force exhibit striking differences in kinetic behavior due to slight differences in their manganese and carbon contents, suggesting that these elements reduce the potency of the embryos. The observed activation energies of the isothermal martensitic transformation are in very good agreement with the calculated activation energies based on a nucleation model. Moreover, in these alloys, the potency of the active embryos remains almost constant during the course of the isothermal transformation, notwithstanding the progressive generation of new embryos due to autocatalytic factors. The best fit between theory and experiment is obtained on the assumption that the number of pre-existing embryos in the parent austenite is 10⁷ per cm³ . The probability of detecting such embryos by transmission electron microscopy is less than 1 in 10⁵. The increase in the rate of isothermal martensitic transformation as a function of time has been shown to be due to the formation of new plates by auto catalysis, while the subsequent retardation is attributable to the partitioning of the austenite by the martensitic plates.

The verification of the model was done using measured etching yield data determined by quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) in conjunction with plasma neutral and ion concentrations/fluxes determined by mass spectrometry. The etching and deposition rates have been measured as functions of ion impinging angle, sample temperature, which are necessary for profile evolution modeling of silicon oxide etching in inductively coupled plasma. Angular dependence of etching yield of oxide in fluorocarbon plasma shows very unique behavior unlike typical ion-induced chemical etching or physical sputtering. Ion-induced deposition model was suggested and tested."

Importance of Ge in photonics has grown and through techniques developed in our group we demonstrated low density of dislocations (<1x109cm-2) and point defects Ge growth for photonic devices. The focus of this document will be exclusively on Ge light emitters. Ge is an indirect band gap material that has shown the ability to act like a pseudo direct band gap material. Through the use of tensile strain and heavy doping, Ge exhibits properties thought exclusive of direct band gap materials. Dependence on temperature suggests strong interaction between indirect bands, [Delta] and L, and the direct band gap at [Gamma]. The behavior is justified through increase in photoluminescence on Ge. The range of efficient emission is to 120° with the first band interaction, and above 400° on the second band interaction. Low defect concentration in Ge is achieved through chemical vapor deposition at high vacuum (~1x10-8 mbar) in a two-step process. The high temperature growth and low concentration of particles permits epitaxial growth with low defect concentration. Chemical selectivity forbids Ge growth on oxide. Oxide trenches permit the growth on Si for a variety of shapes, without detrimentally affecting the strain of the Ge devices. Dopant concentration above intrinsic growth concentration, ~1x1019cm-3 phosphorus, have been achieved through a series of methods non-CMOS, spin-on dopant; and CMOS, implantation and delta doping. All the techniques explored use enhanced dopant diffusion observed in Ge under heavy n-type doping. A dopant source, or well, is used to distribute the dopants in the Ge without increasing the defect concentration. The approach lead to the development of electrically injected devices, LEDs and LDs. Ge pnn double heterostructure diodes were made under low, ~1x1018cm-3, and heavy n-type doping, >1x1019cm-3. Both devices showed improved performance compared to pin Ge LED. Furthermore, heavy doped Ge diodes exhibit evidence of bleaching or transparency. The techniques described permitted the development of Ge-on-Si laser with a concentration ~1-2x1019cm-3. It is the first demonstration of a Ge laser optically pumped working under the direct band gap assumption like other semiconductors. It represents the evidence of carrier inversion on an indirect band gap semiconductor. With 50cm-1 gain, the material shows Fabry-Perot cavity behavior. Finally, we demonstrated a fully functioning laser diode monolithically integrated on Si. Ge pnn lasers were made exhibiting a gain >1000cm-1 and exhibiting a spectrum range of over 200nm, making Ge the ideal candidate for Si photonics.",

Here we have developed light- and ultrasound- triggerable liposomes that provide on-demand nerve block at the desired timing, intensity and duration.

Sciatic nerve blockades for up to a duration of 2h was successfully achieved with safe dosage of light (730 nm, 75 mW/cm², 15 min) or ultrasound (1 MHz, 3W/cm², 10 min). Sciatic nerve block could be triggered repeatedly with light or ultrasound for more than 5 times upon a single injection. The duration of nerve block showed a linear relationship with the energy density of the triggering event, which was controlled by duration and intensity of the external energy source.

This work presents a framework for the rational design of transition-metal perovskite oxide catalysts that can accelerate the development of highly active catalysts for more efficient energy storage and conversion systems.

Using this approach, we show that the charge-transfer energy - a parameter that captures the energy configuration of oxygen and transition-metal valence electrons - is a central descriptor capable of modifying both the oxygen evolution kinetics and mechanism. Its role in determining the absolute band energies of a catalyst can rationalize the differences in the electron-transfer and proton-transfer kinetics across oxide chemistries. Furthermore, we corroborate that the charge-transfer energy is one of the most influential parameters on the oxygen evolution reaction through a statistical analysis of a multitude of structure-activity relationships.

The spectral and substrate orientation dependence of the magneto-optical figure of merit of epitaxial Ce: YIG on GGG substrates show very high magneto-optical figure of merit (379-400° dB-1 at [lambda] = 1550 nm for all substrate orientations). The thermal budgets of Ce: YIG growth on ShN4 (2 high temperature PLD steps and a rapid thermal anneal, RTA), silicon-on-insulator substrates (a high and a low temperature PLD step and a RTA) and optical resonator chips (one PLD step, one RTA, YIG seed layer from the top) were progressively reduced to achieve improved integrated optical isolators with low insertion loss of 7.4 ± 1.8 dB and an isolation ratio of 13.0 ± 2.2 dB.

    "abstract": "About 250,000 people undergo knee and hip arthroplasty each year in North America alone, with hundreds of thousands more receiving joints over the rest of the world. Two factors are key to the success of these implants: first, the quality of attachment of the prosthetic joint to the patient's bone, and second, the low generation of wear particles as the components of the prosthesis articulate against each other. This thesis is a study of both of these factors. First, the mechanism of bone apposition to hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings on Ti-6Al-4V was investigated via transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In this section of the study, Ti alloy cylinders were coated with HA by two different methods to yield three types of coatings - annealed and unannealed plasma-spray (PSHA) coatings and an annealed ion-beam assisted deposited (IBAD-HA) coating. These cylinders were implanted in trabecular bone in dogs from periods ranging from 3 hours to 14 days. Mechanical testing indicated that the bone/implant interface with the PSHA coated implants was significantly stronger than that with the IBAD-HA coated or uncoated Ti alloy implants. However, there were no differences in the degree of bone apposition to the three HA-coated materials; thus indicating that bone apposition is not a sufficient indicator of mechanical integrity of the bone/HA interface. In the second section of this study, the microstructural factors contributing to the observed wear properties of the oxide on Zr-2.5Nb were investigated via TEM. Zr-2.5Nb barstock which had been rotary-forged to impart an anisotropic microstructure was sectioned and oxidized in dry air at 600°C and 635°C for a variety of times ranging from 30 minutes to 40 hours. Cross-sections across the oxide/metal interface were observed via TEM. The oxide scale comprises primarily monoclinic zirconia, with small amounts of tetragonal zirconia. Evidence of a mixed oxide phase, 6Zr02.Nb205, was also observed. The microstructure of this oxide is dependent on oxidation temperature, the microstructure of the underlying metal, and oxide depth. Two oxide microstructures originating from beta-Zr grains in the alloy were also identified. A third study concerned the architecture and microstructure of naturally-derived and synthetic bone substitute materials (BSMs). While BSMs are used clinically to promote healing in large bone defects, they were useful to this study as a control for the organization of mineral in mature bone. Low voltage high resolution scanning electron microscopy (LVHRSEM) enabled observations of the three dimensional architecture of these materials which were then correlated with TEM observations. The crystallites in an anorganic bovine-derived BSM were organized in a hierarchical fashion which paralleled the organization of collagen. In contrast, the synthetic materials were organized in an isotropic network. The difference in organization was attributed to the formation of the mineral matrix of bone on an anisotropic collagen template.",

The morphologies formed can be tailored through a directed self-assembly (DSA) process using chemical or topographical templates to achieve a desired thin film pattern. This method combines the traditional top-down lithographic methods with the bottom-up self-assembly process to obtain greater control over long range order, the local morphology, and overall throughput of the patterns produced. This work looks at key modeling challenges in optimizing BCP DSA to achieve precision morphology control, reproducibility, and defect control. Modeling techniques based on field theoretic simulations are used to both characterize and predict the morphological behavior of a variety of BCPs under a variety of processing conditions including solvent annealing and DSA under topographical boundary conditions. These methods aid experimental studies by saving time in performing experiments over wide parameter spaces as well as elucidating information that may not be available by current experimental techniques. Both forward simulation approaches are studied where parameters are varied over a wide range with phase diagrams of potential morphologies characterized and inverse design approaches where given target patterns are taken as simulation input and required conditions to produce those patterns are outputted from the simulation for experimental testing.

Communication is often difficult because of both language differences and cultural differences. Although there have been many attempts to meet the communication need on the level of language with machine translators and dictionaries, many problems related to cultural and conceptual differences still remain. To improve traditional machine translators and cross-cultural communication aids, it is necessary to develop automated mechanisms to analyze cultural differences and similarities. This thesis approaches the problems with automatic computation of cultural differences and similarities. This thesis, GlobalMind, provides common-sense databases of various countries and languages and two inference modules to analyze and compute the cultural differences and similarities from the databases.

    "title": "A computational model to connect gestalt perception and natural language",
    "abstract": "We present a computational model that connects gestalt visual perception and language. The model grounds the meaning of natural language words and phrases in terms of the perceptual properties of visually salient groups. We focus on the semantics of a class of words that we call conceptual aggregates e.g., pair, group, stuff, which inherently refer to groups of objects. The model provides an explanation for how the semantics of these natural language terms interact with gestalt processes in order to connect referring expressions to visual groups. Our computational model can be divided into two stages. The first stage performs grouping on visual scenes. It takes a visual scene segmented into block objects as input, and creates a space of possible salient groups arising from the scene. This stage also assigns a saliency score to each group. In the second stage, visual grounding, the space of salient groups, which is the output of the previous stage, is taken as input along with a linguistic scene description. The visual grounding stage comes up with the best match between a linguistic description and a set of objects. Parameters of the model are trained on the basis of observed data from a linguistic description and visual selection task. The proposed model has been implemented in the form of a program that takes as input a synthetic visual scene and linguistic description, and as output identifies likely groups of objects within the scene that correspond to the description. We present an evaluation of the performance of the model on a visual referent identification task. This model may be applied in natural language understanding and generation systems that utilize visual context such as scene description systems for the visually impaired and functionally illiterate.",

    "abstract": "The digital revolution which has changed so many other aspects of modem life has yet to profoundly affect the working process of visual artists and designers. High-quality digital design tools exist, but they provide the user with an improved traditional design process, not a radically new way of designing. Conventional digital design tools are useful, but when design software emulates a paintbrush or photostudio many powerful possibilities of the computational medium are overlooked. This thesis explores emergent design, a design methodology based on a new process, enhanced interactive genetic programming. The emergent design methodology and tools allow designers to effectively create procedural design solutions (design solutions that take the form of a procedure or program) in a way that requires little or no programming on the part of the designer. The use of preliminary fitness functions in the interactive genetic programming process allows the designer to specify heuristics to guide the search and manage the complexity of the interactive genetic programming task. This document is structured in the form of a case study, in which the enhanced genetic programming process and emergent design methodology are described through their application to the specific problem of developing procedural image filters for still and moving images. Two interactive genetic programming systems for image filter evolution are described, GPI and evolution++, along with the Sol programming language that was used to create them. Results from the implementation and use of GPI and evolution++ are presented, including a number of filtered images and image sequences. These results suggest that fitness-agent enhanced interactive genetic programming and the emergent design methodology may play a useful role in the visual design process, allowing designers to explore a wider range of options with greater ease than is possible through a traditional, procedural, or conventional genetic programming design process.",

This thesis takes up one element of the designed police system in the United States: its material culture-from vehicles, to uniforms and badges, to weapons. The physical tools and devices that the police force use are emblematic of explicit and implicit values. These values make certain conditions and encounters possible, and other scenarios impossible. What is behind these tools, and how might our culture see them anew? How might we re-imagine them in the civic act of designing a future? Oversight, transparency, and accountability are a critical piece of the civic fabric. In order for law enforcement to reflect the needs and expectations of citizens, it is in part, our responsibility to interrogate the designs of the key institutions we rely on. But agency in the design space of the police has not been encouraged. This thesis presents one example of how a dialogue around design is a form of productive civic activity and a check against state violence. In it, I offer a complementary set of tools for imagining possible futures of policing that reconsider scenarios for law enforcement, with a provisional freedom from its current form. Problematizing the physical designs of the police, it focuses on the values, priorities, and politics that are inevitably imbued in these objects. This practice-led research draws from interviews with both citizens and law enforcement, design research, and participatory, critical making.

Further, the growth of these communities has led to the need for another system, called SilverWire, to facilitate interaction among communities. SilverWire is a tool for increasing socialization and augmenting communication among communities that actively publish content on the Internet. SilverWire collects and builds models of communities, which form the basis for customized interconnections among communities. Community models are built implicitly by analyzing the contents of the sites that take part in SilverWire and are collected explicitly from questions asked about community purpose, identity and communication. As a result, SilverWire recommends pointers to related community publications and provides comparisons between communities. The goal of the SilverWire system is to be an intermediary that makes communities more aware of other communities doing similar (or interestingly different) work. To evaluate the project I report in detail the progress of one of the groups called the Silver Stringers, which is a local community consisting of approximately 30 senior citizens.

    "abstract": "The violin has long been admired as one of the most beautiful, complex, and challenging musical instruments. With its capacity for nuance, richness of tone, and flexibility of range, its expressive qualities have been surpassed by none, despite the fact that its construction has not been changed for hundreds of years. It is the form and function of the traditional violin that inspired the work detailed in this thesis. Here, the design and construction of a new violin interface, the Hyperbow, is discussed. The motivation driving the research of this instrument was the desire to create a violin bow capable of measuring the most intricate aspects of violin technique, the subtle elements of physical gesture that immediately and directly impact the sound of the instrument while playing. In order to provide this insight into the subtleties of bow articulation, a sensing system was implemented to measure changes in position, acceleration, and the downward and lateral strains on the bow stick. These sensors were fashioned using an electromagnetic field sensing technique, commercial MEMS accelerometers, and foil strain gauges. Because the forces and stresses applied to the bow are immediately connected to a violinist's experience while playing, the implementation of a new music controller that utilizes these intimate aspects of physical interaction between a player and an instrument may inspire altogether new methods of expression. The measurement techniques used in this work were found to be quite sensitive and yielded sensors that were easily controllable by a player using traditional right hand bowing technique. In addition, the Hyperbow proved to be helpful in recognizing and analyzing the physical parameters of common bowstrokes",

    "abstract": "Robotic assembly of discrete cellular lattices at super-hertz (>1Hz) assembly rates is shown to be possible by integrating the design of a modular robotic assembler with the specified lattice topology such that the lattice can itself be removed from the incremental assembly process. Limits to assembly rates are ultimately dependent on allowable error, system stiffness, and damping characteristics. Vibrations due to cyclical motions of the end-effector, locomotion system, and the dynamic response of an incrementally varying lattice must settle to acceptable ranges to enable engagement between end-effectors, discrete elements, and their affixing features to adjacent cells. For given system dynamics, longer settling times enables greater energy dissipation, and less error. With a greater allowable error at the interface, a shorter assembly cycle period can be attained. Passive alignment features designed into the robot end-effectors, locomotion systems, and the discrete lattice elements reduce the precision requirements of the assembly process by opening up the acceptable error range, thereby, enabling higher assembly cycle-rates. An experiment was performed to evaluate how an assembler locally referencing a lattice performed in comparison to a globally referenced assembler. The two assemblers were of similar kinematic form: both gantry-type CNC machines: a ShopBot and a custom built relative robotic assembler. The results showed superior performance by the global coordinate frame system. An error budget analysis of the two systems showed that the locally referenced, lattice based system had a larger more variable structural loop than the global coordinate frame ShopBot. The control experiment, demonstrated 0.1Hz assembly rates, while first order approximations predict a maximum 4Hz cycle for the specified interface geometry. Results show that in order to successfully assemble discrete cellular lattices at super-hertz rates the robot must itself become the local, instantaneous global coordinate frame such that the structural loop is absolutely minimized, while stiffness is maximized; at the instantaneous moment of assembly the structural loop of the robot must reference only itself.",

    "abstract": "This thesis develops a novel method of decomposing a 3D phase space description of light into multiple partially coherent modes, and applies this decomposition to the creation of a more flexible 3D display format. Any type of light, whether it is completely coherent, partially coherent or incoherent, can be modeled either as a sum of coherent waves or as rays. A set of functions, known as phase space functions, provide an intuitive model for these waves or rays as they pass through a 3D volume to a display viewer's eyes. First, this thesis uses phase space functions to mathematically demonstrate the limitations of two popular 3D display setups: parallax barriers and coherent holograms. Second, this thesis develops a 3D image design algorithm based in phase space. The \"mode-selection\" algorithm can find an optimal holographic display setup to create any desired 3D image. It is based on an iterative algebraic-rank restriction process, and can be extended to model light with an arbitrary degree of partial coherence. Third, insights gained from partially coherent phase space representations lead to the suggestion of a new form of 3D display, implemented with multiple time-sequential diffracting screens. The mode-selection algorithm determines an optimal set of diffracting screens to display within the flicker-fusion rate of a viewer's eye. It is demonstrated both through simulation and experiment that this time-sequential display offers improved performance over a fixed holographic display, creating 3D images with increased intensity variation along depth. Finally, this thesis investigates the tradeoffs involved with multiplexing a holographic display over time with well-known strategies of multiplexing over space, illumination angle and wavelength. The examination of multiplexing tradeoffs is extended into the incoherent realm, where comparisons to ray-based 3D displays can hopefully offer a more unified summary of the limitations of controlling light within a volume.",

The viewports can be shared with remote collaborators both asynchronously and in real time. The system allows distributed users to navigate shared 3D space individually or jointly (synchronizing the viewport); generate an overlay of the live video of hand drawings, physical objects, and printed images from the desktop surface with the viewport; and control the legibility of the visual contents. This spatial video overlay technique in the 3D data space allows distributed users to share the live annotations over the synchronized viewports.

    "abstract": "Marketing factors such as pricing and branding are known to affect people's judgments and expectations regarding a product. When the product in question is a medical treatment, this effect may modify the placebo response. As the placebo response modifies the overall effect of the treatment in an additive manner, this implies that marketing factors may have a direct effect on medical outcomes, particularly in disorders that have large placebo effects. This thesis explores this idea. First a laboratory study is presented that used electric shocks and a placebo pill to demonstrate that a price discount may reduce the efficacy of a placebo analgesic. A second laboratory study, using the cold pressor test and a medication with low non-placebo efficacy, failed to demonstrate superiority of a brand-name over generic medication in terms of cold tolerance or pain ratings, but the brand-name did lead to quicker habituation to the cold pain. In addition, quantitative and qualitative research exploring attitudes held towards generic medications shows conflicted beliefs and a lack of complete trust in generic medications in both general and geriatric populations. \"Non-commercial\" forms of marketing, including the labeling of, and description of, a disorder, are also touched upon. The implications of this research for marketing are discussed, as well as necessary steps for the research development of this field.",

This document presents ways and ideas that show how a shape display's dynamic shape changing ability can work in unison with physical objects that are placed on top of it. First, we introduce the idea of shape synthesis, which is the physical augmentation of inert physical objects with the dynamic shape to create a seemingly new object. This synthesized object combines the advantages of the inert object's natural affordances with the computational power of dynamic shape change. In so doing, we can substitute for passive objects, complement passive objects and enable easier interactions with a shape display. We then show that a shape display can be used to assemble, disassemble and reassemble structures from simple passive building blocks through stacking, scaffolding and catapulting. Then, we introduce special unpowered kinematic modules that can be driven and sensed through the underlying pins. These modules can translate the vertical pin movement into other degrees of freedom like rotation or horizontal movement. This suggests that a shape display can be regarded as a versatile physical control platform that can drive and control a variety of useful mechanisms and objects.",

    "abstract": "Nutritional assessment is an important problem for every American. Studies suggest that as many as 90% of Americans fall short of Vitamins D and E as a result of their regular dietary habits, and up to 50% of Americans do not get enough Vitamin A and Calcium. On the other hand, 68.8% of American adults over 20 were considered overweight or obese (had BMI of over 25), with excessive consumption of added sugars, fats, and carbohydrates being a key factor. There are two potential challenges that, if solved, may help many ordinary Americans manage their diets healthily. The first is recording dietary intake so that we have sufficient information regarding an individual's dietary pattern, and the second is interpreting nutritional profiles from the foods people are eating. It's after these two steps that nutritional intake can be inferred and insights into dietary balance can be gained. This thesis focuses on the first challenge, enabling more convenient tracking of dietary patterns supported by automatic image recognition. Our goal was to provide an improved alternative to current mainstream methods of keeping dietary records such as written records for clinical studies, or text input based digital trackers such as MyFitnessPal. Both current methods are quite tiresome, and we saw opportunities in utilizing computer vision methods to automate the recognition of what a user is eating, therefore hoping to reduce the need for manual input and making the process easier. In practice, we implemented an image classifier based on the Inception architecture of GoogLeNet, and trained it on the Food- 101 dataset. The performance of the classifier on the validation set achieved around 87% for top 5 accuracy. We then deployed our image recognition apparatus in the form of a mobile application, to examine the actual performance of this apparatus in an in-field setting with actual consumer eating patterns. The overall in-field recognition performance was around 28% (top 5), however, since only 30% of our meals observed were actually of foods belonging to the 101 classes we had trained the classifier to recognize, the in-field recognition accuracies for when foods to record were of foods we had trained on was around 92%. Furthermore, in subjective user surveys, 67% of users preferred our computer vision based apparatus to existing text input based digital trackers like MyFitnessPal, with 22% being neutral. Therefore, we believe that this approach to diet tracking is a promising one to explore in the future, as the main cause of low in-field recognition performance seems to be mainly caused by lack of coverage of the training data, and if we can curate a training set that captures the visual food domain appropriately, this approach can yield high in-field results and provide a tangibly more convenient tool for users to log and track their diets.",

With a reimagined signal capture system and an optimized system design, I demonstrate a robust method for capturing the electrical signals emitted from the retina. With the improved accessibility and decreased cost of this technology, there are immediate opportunities for improved ophthalmic care on a broad scale.

We can sample that signal as it's transmitted, by delivering specific stimuli and recording the aggregate response of the photoreceptors, but systems which accomplish this in current practice are out of reach for most ophthalmic clinics and completely unavailable to consumers. With a reimagined signal capture system and an optimized system design, I demonstrate a robust method for capturing the electrical signals emitted from the retina. With the improved accessibility and decreased cost of this technology, there are immediate opportunities for improved ophthalmic care on a broad scale. But beyond the clinical implications, accessible electroretinography presents an unprecedented opportunity for individuals to characterize their specific experience of color, contrast, and movement, making way for a whole new paradigm of tailored display technologies."

This thesis introduces an approach to reflective learning in four facets: cognitive, emotional, social and temporal. The design of the Jots system, as well as its development over time, are discussed. An empirical study with three middle school students who used jots in a facilitated context is analyzed in case studies and categorizations.

    "abstract": "Educational games and digital learning environments provide opportunities to collect fine-grained data on how learners engage with these technologies. The number of technologies targeted at literacy learning for children is increasing. However, the majority of them are structured and reward-based. Therefore, the users' behavior and data collected from them have the same limits. In this thesis, however, we assess children's engagement with a constructionist literacy learning app. The open ended nature of play in such an environment gives us the opportunity to analyze children's play not only through what they made while playing but also how they did it. This thesis provides an analytics pipeline from data acquisition to modeling behavioral patterns. This systematic way of capturing significant events in children's play can be used to inform stakeholders such as parents, peers and teachers and engage them with the learning process. It also gives the learning environment more intelligence on when and what to provide scaffolding on. To collect data, we ran two pilot studies and gathered audio and video recordings of play sessions. In addition, all of the children's interactions within the app were automatically logged. The fine-grained longitudinal data collected during the pilot studies provides a rich yet raw corpus. To reveal the patterns hidden in the data, the analytics pipeline parses logs of low-level interactions into abstract representations for sequences of actions in a word construction process. Next, it visualizes the process for each play session and the entire play history. Using the visualizations, I identified and annotated repeated motifs for more intentional sequences of actions during play and used supervised learning models to capture those patterns. The results of this analytical pipeline are currently being used by literacy experts to provide feedback to parents and suggest activities based on the child's process.",

Reflective Interfaces encourage the user to think about the space of possible choices they can make, reasons for making those choices, and consequences of their interactions for themselves and others. The problem of Cyberbullying is a serious problem, threatening the viability of social networks for youth today, as spam once threatened email in the early days of the Internet. We explore the design of several Reflective Interfaces for helping teens in distress over social network interactions. First, we implemented a fictitious, but fully functional social network, Fakebook, that provides just-in-time and just-in-place help when potentially bullying interactions are detected. Laboratory tests of the Fakebook interface showed encouraging results. Second, we collaborated with MTV on their site, A Thin Line, which finds stories analogous to a users' particular situation and helps reduce feelings of isolation. We are also working on TimeOut, a dashboard for social network providers that alerts them to situations where outbreaks of bullying might escalate in a community. By putting users in a reflective state, Reflective Interfaces can help them self-correct toward an implicit goal of the community, the interface, the application, or reaffirm the user's own stated goals.

But today, this mediation is mechanical, deterministic, and static-often seeing the human as a generalizable and problematic input. With advances in material science however, there is great potential to disrupt these traditional manufactured environments of architecture and turn them into responsive mediated environments. What this thesis aims to explore is this idea of the receptive skin-a sensate and dynamic multimaterial interface for environmental mediation. This suggests that by departing from the view that buildings are static artifacts, we may instead begin to see buildings as organic, living entities. Through the development of a working prototype, this thesis explores how such an interface may manifest itself, through dynamic material composites, instead of mechanical and electronic means.

    "abstract": "Many music enthusiasts abandon music studies because they are frustrated by the amount of time and effort it takes to learn to play interesting songs. There are two major components to performance: the technical requirement of correctly playing the notes, and the emotional content conveyed through expressivity. While technical details like pitch and note order are largely set, expression, which is accomplished through timing, dynamics, vibrato, and timbre, is more personal. This thesis develops expressive re-performance, which entails the simplification of technical requirements of music-making to allow a user to experience music beyond his technical level, with particular focus on expression. Expressive re-performance aims to capture the fantasy and sound of a favorite recording by using audio extraction to split the original target solo and giving expressive control over that solo to a user. The re-performance experience starts with an electronic mimic of a traditional instrument with which the user steps-through a recording. Data generated from the users actions is parsed to determine note changes and expressive intent. Pitch is innate to the recording, allowing the user to concentrate on expressive gesture. Two pre-processing systems, analysis to discover note starts and extraction, are necessary. Extraction of the solo is done through user provided mimicry of the target combined with Probabalistic Latent Component Analysis with Dirichlet Hyperparameters. Audio elongation to match the users performance is performed using time-stretch. Instrument interfaces used were Akais Electronic Wind Controller (EWI), Fender's Squier Stratocaster Guitar and Controller, and a Wii-mote. Tests of the system and concept were performed using the EWI and Wii-mote for re-performance of two songs. User response indicated that while the interaction was fun, it did not succeed at enabling significant expression. Users expressed difficulty learning to use the EWI during the short test window and had insufficient interest in the offered songs. Both problems should be possible to overcome with further test time and system development. Users expressed interest in the concept of a real instrument mimic and found the audio extractions to be sufficient. Follow-on work to address issues discovered during the testing phase is needed to further validate the concept and explore means of developing expressive re-performance as a learning tool.",

Researchers in this field have mainly focused on laboratory experiments, which may not fully capture the complex situations that teams encounter in real life.

In this thesis we propose a methodology that bridges the gap between these two settings -- the laboratory and the field. By combining a new, affordable electronic badge that captures vocalization data with an innovative setting -- the Hackathon -- we create a new environment for studying team performance. This methodology reduces the duration and maintenance burden of such studies, and offers new opportunities for examining the effects of interventions on teamwork. The preliminary results from our studies show a variety of individual and team behaviors that can be captured in Hackathons using badges, such as participation, the parity of contribution to group discussions, the level of turn taking, and the frequency and duration of meetings. In a Hackathon, we measure these behaviors throughout the entire life cycle of each team, observe how they change in response to different shocks, and study how well the team members collaborate and perform as a team.",

This ability depends on factors that range from the psychological biases that predispose us to learn from skillful and prestigious people, to the development of technologies for recording and communicating information: from clay tablets to the Internet. How do these communication technologies affect the size and composition of our human collective memory? Here we use two datasets on historical characters to present empirical evidence documenting how communication technologies have shaped human collective memory. We show that changes in communication technologies, including the introduction of movable type printing and shorter forms of printed media-such as newspapers, journals, and pamphlets-were accompanied by sharp changes (or breaks) in the per-capita number of memorable biographies from a given time period found in 'current online and offline sources. Moreover, changes in technology, such as the introduction of.printing, film and radio, and television, coincide with sharp changes in the occupations of the individuals present in these biographical records. These two empirical facts provide evidence in support of theories arguing that communication technologies are more consequential to society than the messages transmitted through them. Finally, this thesis contributes an update to the Pantheon dataset that includes historical geocoded data.

Jacob Hanna, the specialist leading the project's Israeli arm, said it may be possible to use the technique to create a baby in just two years. \"It has already caused interest from gay groups because of the possibility of making egg and sperm cells from parents of the same sex,\" he said.\"2 Is creating a baby from same-sex parents the ethical thing to do? Who has the right to decide this, and how? This project aims to design and inspire debate about the bioethics of producing babies from same-sex couples. In this project, the DNA data of a lesbian couple was analyzed using 23andMe to simulate and visualize their potential children, and then we created a set of fictional, \"what if' future family photos using this information to produce a hardcover album which was presented to the couple as a gift. To achieve more public outreach, we worked with the Japanese national television service, NHK, to create a 30-minute documentary film following the whole process, which aired in October 2015."

    "title": "Exploiting object dynamics for recognition and control",
    "abstract": "This thesis explores how state-of-the-art object recognition methods can benefit from integrating information across multiple observations of an object. Considered are active vision systems that allow to steer the camera along predetermined trajectories, resulting in sweeps of ordered views of an object. For systems of this kind, a solution is presented that exploits the order relationship between successive frames to derive a classifier based on the characteristic motion of local features across the sweep. It is shown that this motion model reveals structural information about the object that can be exploited for recognition. The main contribution of this thesis is a recognition system that extends invariant local features (shape context) into the time domain by adding the mentioned feature motion model into a joint classifier. Second, an entropy-based view selection scheme is presented that allows the vision system to skip ahead to highly discriminative viewing positions. Using two datasets, one standard (ETH-80) and one collected from our robot head, both feature motion and active view selection extensions are shown to achieve a higher-quality hypothesis about the presented object quicker than a baseline system treating object views as an unordered stream of images.",

Compliant features are seamlessly integrated into a 3D printed socket to achieve lower interface peak pressures over bony protuberances by using anthropomorphic data acquired through surface scanning and magnetic resonance imaging techniques. An inverse linear mathematical transformation spatially maps quantitative measurements (bone tissue depth) of the human residual limb to the corresponding socket shape and impedance characteristics. The CAD/CAM VIPr socket is compared to a state-of-the-art prosthetic socket of similar internal geometry and shape, designed by a prosthetist using conventional methods. An active, bilateral transtibial male amputee of weight 70 kg walks on a force plate loaded 5-meter walkway, at self-selected speeds while synchronized ground reaction forces, motion capture data and socket residual limb interface pressures are measured for the evaluated sockets. We anticipated a decreased average interface pressure (measured using the Teksan F-SocketTM pressure sensors) in the VIPr socket, especially over stiff anatomical landmarks including the fibula head, the tibia, lateral and medial femoral condyles and medial tibial flare. Contact interface pressure recorded during stance of a complete gait cycle indicated a 15% and 17% reduction at toe-off and heel-strike respectively at the fibula head while the subject uses a VIPr socket in comparison to a conventional socket of similar internal shape. A corresponding 7% and 8% reduction in pressure is observed along the tibia. Similar trends of high-pressure reductions are observed during stair ascent trials with the VIPr socket.",

Some of these nodes called Stargates have the capability to communicate to the external world. The problem is that these gateways can fail or lose capacity unexpectedly.

One common approach to improving face-to-face contexts is to add new communication channels - a strategy often described as creating \"backchannels.\" In my work, I use a series of novel complementary communication systems to show how adding communication platforms to collaborative situations can be useful while also arguing for a new conceptual model of a main stage and a side stage (in the Goffman sense) that contrasts with the traditional model of backchannels.

    "title": "Making machines that make : object-oriented hardware meets object-oriented software",
    "abstract": "Rapid prototyping has been in the limelight for the past decade. 3D printers have an evocative name that promises production of complex parts on demand. Yet current practice doesn't quite deliver on these promises of advanced manufacturing. Existing digital fabrication tools enable repeatability and precision by using codes to describe machine actions. But the infrastructure used for digital fabrication machines is difficult to extend, modify, and customize. It is very difficult for the end-user to incorporate more forms of control into the workflow. Machine design today is largely the same as it was 50 years ago, despite decades of progress in other fields such as computer science and network engineering. I argue that we need to transition from rapid prototyping to rapid prototyping of rapid prototyping. To make diverse goods, we need diverse tools. To develop diversity in digital fabrication tools, we need reconfigurable and extensible infrastructure for machine building. Using insights from object-oriented programming, end-to-end principles in network design, and the open system interconnection model, I propose a new paradigm for machine building called object-oriented hardware. In this paradigm, software objects and hardware objects are peers that have procedures, methods, ports, and presentations. Machine building modules are available as software libraries are to programmers. A machine instantiation is an assembly of objects situated in a particular context. Using this approach, a thing together with the machine that makes it becomes an application. This method transcends the additive versus subtractive manufacturing comparisons by considering both types of rapid automation. Development work is divided into infrastructural engineering, which develop modules for use in any machine, and application development, which develop specific machine instantiations. Here I present technical implementations of machine building infrastructure first. These include distributed networked controls, reconfigurable software interfaces, and modular mechanical machine components. Then I present machine instantiations that use this infrastructure to demonstrate its capability. Finally to evaluate the object-oriented hardware paradigm in the wild, I observe machine building novices using these tools in both a workshop format and in the Fab Lab network for machine building. To make the modular components for machine building accessible in this context, I developed an extensible toolkit for machine building-the Cardboard Machine Kit. Using this toolkit, novices were able to make a wide range of machines, demonstrating the power of this method.",

    "abstract": "A key feature of neural circuits in the mammalian brain is their 3-dimensional geometric complexity. The ability to optically drive or silence sets of neurons distributed throughout complexly shaped brain circuits, in a temporally precise fashion, would enable analysis of how sets of neurons in different parts of the circuit work together to achieve specific neural codes, circuit dynamics, and behaviors. It could also enable new prototype neural control prosthetics capable of entering information into the brain in a high-bandwidth, cell-specific fashion. This dissertation work involves the development, characterization, and initial utilization of a technology capable of delivering patterned light to 3D targets in neural tissue. Silicon oxynitride waveguide fabrication was optimized for integration onto insertable silicon probes. The waveguides have a propagation loss of-0.4 dB/cm. Right-angle corner mirrors were fabricated at the outputs of the waveguides with losses measured to be 1.5 ± 0.4 dB. Silicon MEMS techniques were developed to fabricate both single- and multi-shank probe geometries with integrated waveguides. Methods were developed to assemble the multi-shank probes into a 3D format using discrete monolithic silicon pieces. Three coupling schemes were developed to couple light to both single- and multi-shank probes. For individual probes not assembled in a 3D format, ribbon cables were used. Modular connection schemes were developed based on ribbon cable connector technologies. Input coupling losses were measured to be 3.4 ± 2.2 dB. For probes which were assembled in a 3D format, two coupling methods were developed: projector-based and scanning-mirror-based. The losses associated with the projector-based system are 17.3 ± 1.8 dB. With a 1.5W 473 nm laser source, 100 pW is capable of being delivered from 300 separate waveguides. The losses associated with the scanning-mirrorbased system are 11.9 ± 2.5 dB. With a 1.6 mW 473 nm laser source, 100 pW is capable of being delivered from an individual waveguide. These fabrication, assembly, and coupling methods demonstrate a successful development of a technology capable of delivering patterned light to 3D targets in neural tissue. Initial biological experiments being performed on microbial-opsin expressing mice is presented. 3D patterned light is delivered to targets in the primary somatosensory cortex while electrical activity is recorded from the primary motor cortex.",

    "abstract": "The tendency of block copolymers (BCP's) to microphase separate at the molecular level, producing a wide array of ordered nanostructures, is of particular interest from an engineering standpoint due to the unique mechanical, optical or electrical properties that ensue. Upon considering the potential applications of these materials, however, one limitation arises from the lack of control over bulk thermodynamics and the appearance of order/disorder (solid-like/liquid-like) transitions in these materials. To address this problem, this thesis aims to, firstly, develop a more quantifiable understanding of the molecular factors governing BCP phase behavior, and, secondly, use that knowledge to molecularly engineer new BCP's with enhanced processibility. While most BCP's microphase separate upon cooling through an upper disorder-to-order transition (UDOT), polystyrene-block-poly n-butyl methacrylate, PS-b-PBMA, undergoes ordering upon heating through a lower disorder-to-order transition (LDOT). Preliminary studies on this material revealed a unique pressure sensitivity of this ordering transition. By applying pressure, this material could be forced into the segmentally mixed liquid state, implying \"baroplasticity\", a highly attractive property from a processing standpoint. To better understand the molecular origin of this behavior, the bulk thermodynamics of a family of BCPs formed from styrene and a homologous series of n-alkyl methacrylates (PS-b-PnAMA, n ranging from 1 to 12) was investigated, both as a function of pressure and temperature. The results of this study reveal an unexpected, though systematic, dependence of the phase behavior of these BCP's on monomer architecture. In short, over a certain range of alkyl side chain length, PS-b-PnAMA block copolymers are marginally compatible and exhibit unexpectedly large pressure coefficients for the ordering transition, ranging from 60 to 150°C/kbar. In an attempt to identify molecular parameters responsible for these thermodynamic trends, as well as those displayed by other systems reported in the literature, combined group contribution/lattice fluid model calculations of the cohesive properties of the corresponding homopolymers are performed. Based on this analysis, the homopolymer mass density is proposed as a macroscopic parameter that appears to govern phase behavior in weakly interacting block copolymers or polymer blends. Using this new criterion, a simple tool for the molecular design of phase behavior into weakly interacting BCP's is identified, which is successfully used to engineer \"baroplastic\" behavior into several new systems of commercial relevance, including elastomers and adhesives based on styrene and low Tg acrylates. In light of the improved understanding of BCP phase behavior emerging from these studies, a simple phenomenological free energy expression is proposed for compressible polymer mixtures, that can be extended to block copolymers. Its ability to predict qualitative phase diagrams for the systems investigated in this thesis as well as many other polymer pairs is demonstrated.

This thesis proposes that technology in face-to-face settings can be used to address the social factors that have damaging influence on group decision-making processes. While there is much work in the area of collaborative software and groupware, this work differentiates itself with its specific aim to influence the way a group shares information without mediating the group's communication. By presenting visualizations to the group of individual levels of participation and turn-taking behavior, the technology aims to augment the group's communication ability, by making it more aware of imbalances. A series of dynamic displays positioned peripherally to a discussion were developed and used by a variety of groups during face-to-face meetings. Both observational and experimental results indicate that these displays influence individual participation levels and the process of information sharing used during a decision-making discussion. A display revealing real-time participation levels caused those at the highest levels of participation to decrease the amount they spoke. Viewing a visualization of previous turn-taking patterns caused those who spoke the least to increase the amount they spoke in a subsequent discussion; real-time feedback did not produce this change.

To address this problem, I present modeling and recognition techniques to adapt gesture models to the situation at hand. A number of systems and frameworks that use adaptive gesture models are presented. First, the parametric hidden Markov model (PHMM) addresses the representation and recognition of gesture families, to extract how a gesture is executed. Second, strong temporal models drawn from natural gesture theory are exploited to segment two kinds of natural gestures from video sequences.

    "abstract": "This thesis is concerned with the notion of fluency in human-robot interaction (HRI), exploring cognitive mechanisms for robotic agents that would enable them to overcome the stop-and-go rigidity present in much of HRI to date. We define fluency as the ethereal yet manifest quality existent when two agents perform together at high level of coordination and adaptation, in particular when they are well-accustomed to the task and to each other. Based on mounting psychological and neurological evidence, we argue that one of the keys to this goal is the adaptation of an embodied approach to robot cognition. We show how central ideas from this psychological school are applicable to robot cognition and present a cognitive architecture making use of perceptual symbols, simulation, and perception-action networks. In addition, we demonstrate that anticipation of perceptual input, and in particular of the actions of others, are an important ingredient of fluent joint action. To that end, we show results from an experiment studying the effects of anticipatory action on fluency and teamwork, and use these results to suggest benchmark metrics for fluency. We also show the relationship between anticipatory action and a simulator approach to perception, through a comparative human subject study of an implemented cognitive architecture on the robot AUR, a robotic desk lamp, designed for this thesis. A result of this work is modeling the effect of practice on human-robot joint action, arguing that mechanisms that govern the passage of cognitive capabilities from a deliberate yet slower system to a faster, sub-intentional, and more rigid one, are crucial to fluent joint action in well-rehearsed ensembles.

    "abstract": "The loss of a limb is extremely debilitating. Unfortunately, today's assistive technologies are still far from providing fully functional artificial limb replacements. Although lower extremity prostheses are currently better able to give assistance than their upper-extremity counterparts, important locomotion problems still remain for leg amputees. Instability, gait asymmetry, decreased walking speeds and high metabolic energy costs are some of the main challenges requiring the development of a new kind of prosthetic device. These challenges point to the need for highly versatile, fully integrated lower-extremity powered prostheses that can replicate the biological behavior of the intact human leg. This thesis presents the design and evaluation of a novel biomimetic active knee prosthesis capable of emulating intact knee biomechanics during level-ground walking. The knee design is motivated by a mono-articular prosthetic knee model comprised of a variable damper and two series elastic clutch units spanning the knee joint. The powered knee system is comprised of two series-elastic actuators positioned in parallel in an agonist-antagonist configuration. This investigation hypothesizes that the biomimetic active-knee prosthesis, with a variable impedance control, can improve unilateral transfemoral amputee locomotion in level-ground walking, reducing the metabolic cost of walking at selfselected speeds. To evaluate this hypothesis, a preliminary study investigated the clinical impact of the active knee prosthesis on the metabolic cost of walking of four unilateral above-knee amputees. This preliminary study compared the antagonistic active knee prosthesis with subjects' prescribed knee prostheses. The subjects' prescribed prostheses encompass four of the leading prosthetic knee technologies commercially available, including passive and electronically controlled variable-damping prosthetic systems. Use of the novel biomimetic active knee prosthesis resulted in a metabolic cost reduction for all four subjects by an average of 5.8%. Kinematic and kinetic analyses indicate that the active knee can increase self-selected walking speed in addition to reducing upper body vertical displacement during walking by an average of 16%. The results of this investigation report for the first time a metabolic cost reduction when walking with a prosthetic system comprised of an electrically powered active knee and passive foot-ankle prostheses, as compared to walking with a conventional transfemoral prosthesis. With this work I aim to advance the field of biomechatronics, contributing to the development of integral assistive technologies that adapt to the needs of the physically challenged.",

This investigation hypothesizes that the biomimetic active-knee prosthesis, with a variable impedance control, can improve unilateral transfemoral amputee locomotion in level-ground walking, reducing the metabolic cost of walking at selfselected speeds. To evaluate this hypothesis, a preliminary study investigated the clinical impact of the active knee prosthesis on the metabolic cost of walking of four unilateral above-knee amputees. This preliminary study compared the antagonistic active knee prosthesis with subjects' prescribed knee prostheses. The subjects' prescribed prostheses encompass four of the leading prosthetic knee technologies commercially available, including passive and electronically controlled variable-damping prosthetic systems. Use of the novel biomimetic active knee prosthesis resulted in a metabolic cost reduction for all four subjects by an average of 5.8%. Kinematic and kinetic analyses indicate that the active knee can increase self-selected walking speed in addition to reducing upper body vertical displacement during walking by an average of 16%. The results of this investigation report for the first time a metabolic cost reduction when walking with a prosthetic system comprised of an electrically powered active knee and passive foot-ankle prostheses, as compared to walking with a conventional transfemoral prosthesis. With this work I aim to advance the field of biomechatronics, contributing to the development of integral assistive technologies that adapt to the needs of the physically challenged."

    "title": "Mediated atmospheres : context-aware adaptive lighting and multimodal media environments",
    "abstract": "This dissertation introduces a controller for a context-aware office space that seamlessly and continuously transforms itself to support the activities of its occupants. Properties of the workspace, such as light, sound, textures and objects, have a remarkable influence on the human body, with measurable effects on physiology, cognition, and emotion. New control capabilities, e.g. wireless-controlled lighting and digital media displays, offer an opportunity to dynamically enhance the workspace for recreation, creativity, and productivity, in unison with the occupant's activities. Besides benefits for work engagement, personalized control could optimize for energy efficiency and foster Loose Fit planning to maximize flexible use of limited space. Accordingly, this controller incorporates sensing and computation to mediate between occupants' actions and the adaptive environment in a closed-loop fashion, producing what I call Mediated Atmospheres - seamless transitions of harmonious compositions of (1) light and (2) multimodal media. Through a series of studies, I evaluated this controller and demonstrated its potential to improve the workspace. Improvements were observed in energy savings (52% estimated energy savings compared to static illumination), significant (p < 0.05) increases of perceived fitness for focus and stress restoration, and significant (p < 0.05) physiological changes towards preferred conditions, e.g. in heart rate variability and facial expression. Furthermore, this work discusses the effects of adaptation as a form of behavioral feedback and raises broadly applicable questions about how to best balance automatic control and manual preference setting. The controller, in its core, builds on two contextual control dimensions, Focus and Restoration, which were experimentally discovered. They establish a lower dimensional representation (control map) that facilitates continuous mapping of the sensing and adaptive capabilities. Each unique space produces a new control map, which I computed using either subjective ratings, image analysis or physiological monitoring of the occupant. I performed an in-depth comparison of the image and rating approach for lighting and found that image analysis of either photographs or 3D renderings can accelerate the mapping process by reducing the amount of required human input. This finding allows us to generalize the subjective rating approach, and for the first time enables practicing designers to quickly link the positioning of lighting instruments to perceptual models of space.",

Extracellular electrophysiology is a neural recording method that has been developed to record from large populations of neurons, but well-known problems with signal attribution pose an existential threat to the viability of further system scaling, as analyses of network function become more sensitive to errors in attribution. A key insight is that blind-source separation algorithms such as Independent Component Analysis may ameliorate problems with signal attribution.

This dissertation presents the design and development of an electric vehicle called the \"CityCar\" that confronts the aforementioned problems of urban mobility with a novel vehicle architecture. The assembly of the CityCar derives from a subset of \"urban modular electric vehicle\" (uMEV) components in which five core units are combined to create a variety of solutions for urban personal mobility. Drastically decreasing the granularity of the vehicle's subcomponents into larger interchangeable modules, the uMEV platform expands options for fleet customization while simultaneously addressing the complex rapport between automotive manufacturers and their suppliers through a responsibility shift among their respective subcomponents. Transforming its anatomy from complex mechanically-dominant entities to electrically-dominant modular components enables unique design features within the uMEV fleet. The CityCar for example exploits technologies such as a folding chassis to reduce its footprint by 40% and Robot Wheels that each are allotted between 72 to 120-degrees of rotation to together enable a seven-foot turning circle. Just over 1,000 pounds, its lightweight zero-emitting electric platform, comprised of significantly fewer parts, curbs negative externalities that today's automobiles create in city environments. Additionally, the vehicle platform developed from the assembly of several core units empowers a consortium of suppliers to self-coordinate through a unique modular business model. Lastly, the CityCar specific uMEV confronts problems within urban transit by providing a nimble folding mobility solution tailored specifically to crowded cities.

    "abstract": "We present the design and implementation of the Conductor's Jacket, a unique wearable device that measures physiological and gestural signals, together with the Gesture Construction, a musical software system that interprets these signals and applies them expressively in a musical context. Sixteen sensors have been incorporated into the Conductor's Jacket in such a way as to not encumber or interfere with the gestures of a working orchestra conductor. The Conductor's Jacket system gathers up to sixteen data channels reliably at rates of 3 kHz per channel, and also provides mcal-time graphical feedback. Unlike many gesture-sensing systems it not only gathers positional and accelerational data but also senses muscle tension from several locations on each arm. The Conductor's Jacket was used to gather conducting data from six subjects, three professional conductors and three students, during twelve hours of rehearsals and performances. Analyses of the data yielded thirty-five significant features that seem to reflect intuitive and natural gestural tendencies, including context-based hand switching, anticipatory 'flatlining' effects, and correlations between respiration and phrasing. The results indicate that muscle tension and respiration signals reflect several significant and expressive characteristics of a conductor's gestures. From these results we present nine hypotheses about human musical expression, including ideas about efficiency, intentionality, polyphony, signal-to-noise ratios, and musical flow state.

    "text": "Inside the conductor's jacket : analysis, interpretation and musical synthesis of expressive gesture We present the design and implementation of the Conductor's Jacket, a unique wearable device that measures physiological and gestural signals, together with the Gesture Construction, a musical software system that interprets these signals and applies them expressively in a musical context. Sixteen sensors have been incorporated into the Conductor's Jacket in such a way as to not encumber or interfere with the gestures of a working orchestra conductor. The Conductor's Jacket system gathers up to sixteen data channels reliably at rates of 3 kHz per channel, and also provides mcal-time graphical feedback. Unlike many gesture-sensing systems it not only gathers positional and accelerational data but also senses muscle tension from several locations on each arm. The Conductor's Jacket was used to gather conducting data from six subjects, three professional conductors and three students, during twelve hours of rehearsals and performances. Analyses of the data yielded thirty-five significant features that seem to reflect intuitive and natural gestural tendencies, including context-based hand switching, anticipatory 'flatlining' effects, and correlations between respiration and phrasing. The results indicate that muscle tension and respiration signals reflect several significant and expressive characteristics of a conductor's gestures. From these results we present nine hypotheses about human musical expression, including ideas about efficiency, intentionality, polyphony, signal-to-noise ratios, and musical flow state.

    "abstract": "We are surrounded by visual reproductions: computer screens, photographs, televisions, and countless other technologies allow us to perceive objects and scenes that are not physically in-front of us. All existing technologies that reproduce images perform engineering tradeoffs that provide the viewer with some subset of the visual information that would be available in person, in exchange for cost, convenience, or practicality. For many viewing tasks, incomplete reproductions go unnoticed. This dissertation provides a set of findings that illuminate the value of binocular disparity, and ocular focus information that can be provided by some three-dimensional display technologies. These findings include new experimental methods, as well as results, for conducting evaluations of current and future display technologies. Methodologies were validated on an implementation of digital holographic television, an image capture and reproduction system for visual telepresence. The holographic television system, allows viewers to observe, in real-time, a remote 3D scene, through a display that preserves focus (individual objects can be brought into optical focus at the expense of others), and horizontal motion parallax (depth and other geometry of objects appears natural over a range of head movement). Holographic television can also emulate other precursor 2D and 3D display technologies. This capability was used to validate the evaluation methodologies (meta-evaluation) by comparing visual performance on simulations of conventional displays to results of past studies by other researchers.",

    "abstract": "This thesis links processing in working memory to prosody in speech, and links different working memory capacities to different prosodic styles. It provides a causal account of prosodic differences and an architecture for reproducing them in synthesized speech. The implemented system mediates text-based information through a model of attention and working memory. The main simulation parameter of the memory model quantifies recall. Changing its value changes what counts as given and new information in a text, and therefore determines the intonation with which the text is uttered. Other aspects of search and storage in the memory model are mapped to the remainder of the continuous and categorical features of pitch and timing, producing prosody in three different styles: for small recall values, the exaggerated and sing-song melodies of children's speech; for mid-range values, an adult expressive style; for the largest values, the prosody of a speaker who is familiar with the text, and at times sounds bored or irritated. In addition, because the storage procedure is stochastic, the prosody from simulation to simulation varies, even for identical control parameters. As with with human speech, no two renditions are alike. Informal feedback indicates that the stylistic differences are recognizable and that the prosody is improved over current offerings. A comparison with natural data shows clear and predictable trends although not at significance. However, a comparison within the natural data also did not produce results at significance. One practical contribution of this work is a text mark-up schema consisting of relational annotations to grammatical structures. Another is the product - varied and plausible prosody in synthesized speech. The main theoretical contribution is to show that resource-bound cognitive activity has prosodic correlates, thus providing a rationale for the individual and stylistic differences in melody and rhythm that are ubiquitous in human speech.",

Technology-supported apprenticeship is a model of chronic disease management that embraces the contribution of the patient.

In this model, patients are the novice apprentices of master clinicians. A software platform called CollaboRhythm provides applications on mobile phones and tablets as scaffolding for collaboration.

Powerful virtual visits and instant messaging allow master clinicians to provide adaptive coaching within the context of daily life rather than in the artificial environment of the office. Apprentice patients have the potential to become master coaches themselves; thus producing an exponentially scaling health ecosystem at minimal cost. Two randomized, controlled trials were conducted to evaluate if technology-supported apprenticeship could augment the \"best of the best\" in office-based care and scale it via virtual deployment. Apprentice patients for basal insulin titration at the Joslin Diabetes Center were more satisfied with their care than controls, achieved better outcomes (-3.1% vs. -2.5% HbA1C), and did so with minimal increase in cost ($206). Those for hypertension management at the Massachusetts General Hospital were also more satisfied with their care, achieved better outcomes (-26.3 vs. -15.9 mmHg SBP), and did so with negligible increase in cost ($14). Over a longer period of time, apprenticeship is projected to produce better outcomes at decreased cost. Technology-supported apprenticeship has extraordinary potential, but the paternalistic culture of medicine and its volume-based economic model present significant impediments.

    "abstract": "People can easily become mindless in their decision-making and become disengaged from their surroundings when their actions depend on information and guidance from an assistive technology. Research has shown how automated navigation assistance systems lead users to be disengaged from the space through which they are traveling, resulting in poor recollection of the environment and poorer situational decision-making. This disengagement and mindlessness can potentially increase the risk of accidents and lower the quality of user experience. If we can help people become mindfully attentive to the environment and surroundings while carrying out navigation tasks using assistive technologies, I hypothesize that we will have better memory of the space, improved cognitive reconstruction of environment, and better understanding of the immediate situation, all of which will lead to better decision making and more efficient navigation. In this work, I present a new approach for analyzing the problem of navigation assistance for pedestrians, which considers both the physical and psychological constraints of users focused on navigation. I address the physical constraint that eyes should remain \"on the street\" by providing a new visual interface, named Guiding Light, that offers a mixed reality presentation of guidance information in the environment itself, instead of on a screen. We address the psychological constraint that minds should remain engaged with the environment by applying a framework based on mindfulness and mindlessness theory (Langer 1989) in the design of the system. The theory explains how mindsets affect engagement levels and decision-making in daily activities. In addition, this thesis describes an indoor positioning technology that provides relatively high accuracy localization and heading orientation of a user in indoor environments. The innovation not only involved developing a new sensor but also a software system to collect fingerprint maps and tracking location with the fingerprint maps. This new technology opens up a new area in the field to explore other possibilities of using a magnetic field based positioning system.",

For expert musicians, the body plays an indispensable role in the physical act of playing and the understanding of both musical structure and expressivity. However, many music learning technologies mistakenly assume that playing music is \"playing the notes\" and neglect the role of the body in the development of the musical mind. Drawing from research in telepresence, tangible interfaces, and augmented reality, I propose to bring the body back into the picture, literally and metaphorically, by augmenting a digital player piano with projection mapping. My platform synchronizes dynamic imagery with the piano's moving keys and acoustic sounds. I here focus on two main projects: MirrorFugue and Andante. Inspired by reflections on the lacquered surfaces of a grand piano, MirrorFugue simulates the presence of a virtual pianist whose reflection is actually playing the physically moving keys. It encourages anyone to take the seat left empty at the piano, to feel in his or her own body how music is expressed through the body of the performer, and to play along. Andante presents music as miniature figures that appear to walk and dance on the piano keyboard, physically striking a key with each stop. It conveys the expressivity in rhythms and phrases as well as musical structures through the bodies and movements of the figures. Both installations are designed as immersive \"sandboxes\" for the playful exploration of musical ideas. Beyond my projects, this thesis explores the parallels between music learning and learning and large.

At the theoretical level, I propose a framework through which people can think and learn about identity as a complex entity embracing multiple and contradictory values.

I coined the term identity construction environments (ICE) to refer to computational tools purposefully designed with the goal of helping young people explore different aspects of the self, in particular personal and moral values. My contribution in this thesis involves three dimensions: theory, design and empirical research. At the theoretical level, I propose a framework through which people can think and learn about identity as a complex entity embracing multiple and contradictory values. At the design level, I describe an evolutionary process of building and investigating the use of three identity construction environments which are precursors to the one that is at the center of the empirical investigation described in this thesis."

    "abstract": "A key challenge of data-driven social science is the gathering of high quality multi-dimensional datasets. A second challenge relates to the design and execution of social experiments in the real world that are as reliable as those within a controlled laboratory, yet yield more practical results. We introduce the Social Functional Mechanism-design and Relationship Imaging, or \"SocialfMRI\" - an approach that enhances existing computational social science methodologies by bridging rich data collection strategies with experimental interventions. In this thesis, we demonstrate the value of the Social fMRI approach in our Friends and Family study. We transformed a young-family residential community into a living laboratory for 15 months, through a very fine-grained and longitudinal data collection process combined with targeted experimental interventions. Through the derived dataset of unprecedented quality, the Social fMRI approach allows us to gain insights into intricate social mechanisms and interpersonal relationships within the community in ways not previously possible. This thesis delivers the following contributions: (1) A methodology combining a rich-data experimental approach together with carefully designed interventions, (2) a system supporting the methodology - implemented, field-tested, and released to the world as an open-source framework with a growing community of users, (3) a dataset collected using the system, comprising what is, to date, the richest real-world dataset of its genre, (4) a very large set of experimental findings that contribute to our understanding of important research questions in computational social science in addition to demonstrating the methodology's potential. Among the results described in this thesis are the design and evaluation of a novel mechanism for social support in a health-related context, the observation that the diffusion of mobile applications relies more on the face-to-face interaction ties than on self-perceived friendship ties, and a gained understanding of the evolution of modeling and prediction processes over time and varying sample sizes.",

My research seeks to identify simple, non-verbal cues that human teachers naturally provide that are useful for directing the attention of robot learners. I conducted two novel studies that examined the use of embodied cues in human task learning and teaching behavior. These studies motivated the creation of a novel data-gathering system for capturing teaching and learning interactions at very high spatial and temporal resolutions. Through the studies, I observed a number of salient attention-direction cues, the most promising of which were visual perspective, action timing, and spatial scaffolding. In particular, this thesis argues that spatial scaffolding, in which teachers use their bodies to spatially structure the learning environment to direct the attention of the learner, is a highly valuable cue for robotic learning systems. I constructed a number of learning algorithms to evaluate the utility of the identified cues. I situated these learning algorithms within a large architecture for robot cognition, augmented with novel mechanisms for social attention and visual perspective taking. Finally, I evaluated the performance of these learning algorithms in comparison to human learning data, providing quantitative evidence for the utility of the identified cues.

    "title": "Mind-theoretic planning for social robots",
    "abstract": "As robots move out of factory floors and into human environments, out from safe barricaded workstations to operating in close proximity with people, they will increasingly be expected to understand and coordinate with basic aspects of human behavior. If they are to become useful and productive participants in human-robot teams, they will require effective methods of modeling their human counterparts in order to better coordinate and cooperate with them. Theory of Mind (ToM) is defined as people's ability to reason about others' behavior in terms of their internal states, such as beliefs and desires. Having a ToM allows an individual to understand the observed behavior of others, based not only on directly observable perceptual features but also an understanding of underlying mental states; this understanding allows the individual to anticipate and better react to future actions. In this thesis a Mind-Theoretic Planning (MTP) system is presented which attempts to provide robots with some of the basic ToM abilities that people rely on for coordinating and interacting with others. The MTP system frames the problem of mind-theoretic reasoning as a planning problem with mixed observability. A predictive forward model of others' behavior is computed by creating a set of mental state situations (MSS), each composed of stacks of Markov Decision Process (MDP) models whose solutions provide approximations of anticipated rational actions and reactions of that agent. This forward model, in addition to a perceptual-range limiting observation function, is combined into a Partially Observable MDP (POMDP). The presented MTP approach increases computational efficiency by taking advantage of approximation methods offered by a novel POMDP solver B3RTDP as well as leveraging value functions at various levels of the MSS as heuristics for value functions at higher levels. For the purpose of creating an efficient MTP system, a novel general-purpose online POMDP solver B3RTDP was developed. This planner extends the Real- Time Dynamic Programming (RTDP) approach to solving POMDPs. By using a bounded value function representation, we are able to apply a novel approach to pruning the belief-action search graph and maintain a Convergence Frontier, a novel mechanism for taking advantage of early action convergence, which can greatly improve RTDP's search time. Lastly, an online video game was developed for the purpose of evaluating the MTP system by having people complete tasks in a virtual environment with a simulated robotic assistant. A human subject study was performed to assess both the objective behavioral differences in performance of the human-robot teams, as well as the subjective attitudinal differences in how people perceived agents with varying MTP capabilities. We demonstrate that providing agents with mind-theoretic capabilities can significantly improve the efficiency of human-robot teamwork in certain domains and suggest that it may also positively influence humans' subjective perception of their robotic teammates.",

I also find evidence to suggest that providing more powerful uses of data-structures (such as data-persistence) leads to children using more data structures overall. In the second part of the thesis, I introduce a new system, Scratch Community Blocks, that enables children to create projects that access and analyze data from the Scratch online community (e.g., creating visualizations that show which programming blocks they used in their projects or analyzing trends in the popularity of their projects within the community). Through artifact-based case studies, interviews, and survey responses collected from a group of children using the system, I show how children use data and programming to answer their own questions about learning and social behaviour within the Scratch community.

New technologies based on this mission enable us to more easily sense, interact, and communicate with objects. However, the world is highly variable in physical forms. To achieve the vision of ubiquitous computing, common manmade objects need to be designed from the ground up to incorporate computers and sensors. Often, we find ourselves confined by existing sensing infrastructures that are not designed to adapt the complexity of the physical world. This dissertation presents a research platform to investigate design principles and applications for flexible sensate surfaces. This platform utilizes recent advancements in low-cost, roll-to-roll conductive inkjet printing technology as an enabler for creating a scalable, physically and functionally adaptive and customizable sensing system. This collection of work demonstrates design principles and examples in the following four areas: manufacturing, customizable computer aided design, fabrication with physical manipulation and multi-modal sensing techniques. Two types of manufacturing methods are used and characterized. The first approach customizes the sensing design in a digital environment, where users define the geometry, shape and sensing inputs in a computer and print out customized functional patterns. The second approach is sensor fabrication via physical manipulation, where the sensate surface is premanufactured and through an additive method (paneling linear sensor tape stripes), or a subtractive method (cutting a sensor sheet), and the shape and sensing targets are processed post-manufacturing. Lastly, I demonstrate three techniques for multimodal sensing - designing \"target specific shapes\" for different sensing targets, multiplexing single input electrodes with various analog circuits for near surface sensing (pressure, touch, folding, proximity sensing), and adding extra layers of chemical for the designed ad-hoc sensing target alteration. The outcome of this exploration combines emerging technologies to realize a new way of designing sensate surfaces for smart environments and objects and helps us rethink sensing as both a graphical design and a physical manipulation process.

    "title": "Digital cellular solids : reconfigurable composite materials",
    "abstract": "Digital materials are comprised of a small number of types of discrete physical building blocks, which assemble to form constructions that meet the versatility and scalability of digital computation and communication systems. This work seeks to demonstrate the applicability of a digital material approach in designing new cellular materials and methods for assembly of structures with static reconfigurability. The science of cellular solids has enabled the widespread use of lightweight materials to meet important engineering needs, such as passive energy absorption, but they are not in widespread use for structural applications, perhaps due to a large gap between the strength and stiffness to weight ratios of popular classical solids, and the performance of known lightweight cellular materials that are produced from the same constituent material. The engineering of fiber reinforced composite materials has enabled structures with large reductions in weight for given strength and stiffness targets, but at very high design and processing costs, and many challenges producing mechanical interfaces (joints). Digital materials promise scalable methods of producing functional things with reconfigurable sets of discrete and compatible parts, but the presence of many reversible connections raises questions about the performance of the end result.

    "text": "Digital cellular solids : reconfigurable composite materials Digital materials are comprised of a small number of types of discrete physical building blocks, which assemble to form constructions that meet the versatility and scalability of digital computation and communication systems. This work seeks to demonstrate the applicability of a digital material approach in designing new cellular materials and methods for assembly of structures with static reconfigurability. The science of cellular solids has enabled the widespread use of lightweight materials to meet important engineering needs, such as passive energy absorption, but they are not in widespread use for structural applications, perhaps due to a large gap between the strength and stiffness to weight ratios of popular classical solids, and the performance of known lightweight cellular materials that are produced from the same constituent material. The engineering of fiber reinforced composite materials has enabled structures with large reductions in weight for given strength and stiffness targets, but at very high design and processing costs, and many challenges producing mechanical interfaces (joints). Digital materials promise scalable methods of producing functional things with reconfigurable sets of discrete and compatible parts, but the presence of many reversible connections raises questions about the performance of the end result.

    "abstract": "Mediated communication between public spaces is a relatively new concept. One current example of this interaction is video conferencing among people within the same organization. Large scale video-conferencing walls have begun to appear in public or semi-public areas, such as workplace lobbies and kitchens. These connections provide a link via audio and/or video to another public space within the organization. When placed in public or semi-public work spaces, they are often designed for casual encounters among people within that community. Thus far, communicating via these systems has not met expectations. Some drawbacks to such systems have been lack of privacy, gaze ambiguity, spatial incongruity, and fear of appearing too social in a work environment. In this thesis we explore a different goal and approach to linking public spaces. We are not creating a substitute for face-to-face interaction, but rather new modes of conversational and physical interaction within this blended space. This is accomplished through the introduction of what we are defining as a social catalyst. We address the need for designs best suited for linking public spaces and present a series of design criteria for incorporating mediated communication between public and semi-public spaces.",

    "abstract": "This thesis develops techniques and methods that extend the art and craft of storytelling, and in particular enable the creation of mobile cinema. Stories are always constrained by the medium in which they are told and the mode by which they are delivered to an audience. This dissertation addresses the design of content, systems, and tools that facilitate the emerging type of computational audio-visual narrative that we call mobile cinema. Storytelling in this medium requires temporally and spatially encoded narrative segments that are delivered over a wireless channel to mobile devices such as PDAs and mobile phones. These devices belong to \"the audience,\" individuals who are navigating physical space and interact with local circumstances in the environment. This thesis examines the underlying requirements for coherent mobile narrative and explores two particular challenges which must be solved in order to make a reliable and scalable stream of content for mobile cinema: technology uncertainty (the fact that what the mobile cinema system presents may not be what the creator intends) and participation uncertainty (the fact that what the audience does may not be what the creator expects). The exploration and analysis of these problems involved prototyping two versions of the M-Views system for mobile cinema and three prototype cinematic narratives. Small user studies accompanied each production. The iterative process enabled the author to explore both aspects of uncertainty and to introduce innovations in four key areas to help address these uncertainties: practical location detection, authoring tools designed for mobile channels, responsive story presentation mechanisms, and creative story production strategies.",

    "abstract": "My research efforts focus primarily on two areas: (1) developing engaging technological tools that promote learning and creative expression and (2) designing supportive environments that invite broad participation with these technologies. In this dissertation, I argue that the ways in which people use chalk (e.g., drawing hopscotch grids) can serve as an inspiration for rethinking how people can harness the expressive power of computational technologies. Today's computing devices have the potential to enhance expressive activities for diverse groups in similar ways that chalk does, but that potential has yet to be realized. At the core of my research is the Hook-ups System, a set of technologies and activities designed to enable young people to create interactive experiences by programming connections between physical and digital media. With it, young people integrate sensors with various materials to create tangible interfaces for controlling images and sounds in computer programs that they themselves create. For example, a 10-year-old created a paper-plate-based flying saucer, added a sensor, then wrote a program to control an animated flying saucer image on the computer screen. A framework called the Constellation of Connected Creators emerged from my work with the Hook-ups System. It provides facilitators with strategies for introducing technological tools and activities to communities of learners. It identifies several roles that both facilitators and participants adopt over time to sustain youth engagement in technology-rich learning activities: creator, co-learner, collaborator, coach, and colleague. This dissertation reports on my investigation that took place in two after-school technology centers over a five-year period. Two sets of questions guided my inquiry. The first set probed how attributes of the Hook-ups System enabled diverse audiences to engage in building personally meaningful projects, express themselves, and transform how they approached design. The second set examined which strategies were successful for using the Constellation of Connected Creators to establish a culture in which facilitators engaged groups of newcomers, cultivated future facilitators and supported their successors.",

    "abstract": "In recent years the world became mostly urban, communication untethered and objects surpassed humans connected to the Internet. We are being shaped by the intersection of urbanization and ubiquitous computing. \"Smart Cities\" offer an efficiency-driven solution by \"programming\" the city, but this centralized approach forgets that it is the people that make the city and that playing is central to being human. Digital or physical, play is an act of creation and appropriation, a respite in a world geared towards consumption, efficiency and technological determinism. Simultaneously, playgrounds are suffering abandonment. Poorly designed, they are deemed childish and boring, the streets insecure and parents too busy. Portable computing devices have taken over most of the playtime and confined it to human-screen interaction. With less time spent outdoors, social networks and video games have become important hubs where we converge to play-mediated, across distance, with people we might never meet. This dissertation proposes that the advantages of connected play need not be exclusive to the indoors, and that playgrounds today need no real estate. Additionally, it hypothesizes that connected play in the public space enhances the social integration function that playgrounds as architectural constructs have previously served. Drawing from research in play, cognitive development, ubiquitous computing, architecture, telepresence and urban planning, this dissertation posits the redesign of playgrounds into Networked Playscapes. Grounded in the public space, they take existing urban affordances and add largely invisible technological underpinnings so as to support connected play. Deployed in Mexico City, Networked Playscapes is illustrated through three experiments: Triciclo, Andamio and ListenTree. Placed at highly marginalized areas and designed with a broad definition of play, they provide infrastructure for connection at different scales while centering on ludic interaction as the purpose to come together across social and geographic divisions. Space informs play as much as play can inform space. This thesis will discuss design guidelines driven by local idiosyncrasies and physical affordances for grounding and place making, and proposes taking the telepresent quality of imaginative play as the parameter to make congruous use of physical computing embedded in architectural constructs and nature itself.",

    "abstract": "Subjective and affective elements are well-known to influence human decision making. This dissertation presents a theoretical and empirical framework on how human decision makers' subjective experience and affective prediction influence their choice behavior under uncertainty, frames and emotions. The framework extends and integrates existing theories of prospect theory (PT) and reinforcement learning (RL), drawing on a growing literature offering the role of affect in decision making and the neural underpinnings of human decision behavior. The proposed Affective-Cognitive (AC) model extends Prospect Theory (PT)- based subjective value functions to model human experienced-utility and predicted-utility functions. The AC model assumes that the shapes (or parameters) of these subjective value functions dynamically vary with the decision makers affective states in sequential decision making. Human decision-making experiments were conducted to empirically infer how people adjust the parameters (i.e., shape and reference point) of their experienced-utility and predicted-utility functions in sequential decision-making situations involving incidental affective states (e.g., anger, fear, economic fear) and task-related confidence. I constructed a new model combining measures to evaluate risk preferences: behavioral choices, selfreported experience self-reported experience, self-reported predicted utility, self-reported confidence. The analysis results show how domain uncertainty, framing, and emotion state of decision makers influence their subjective experience and discriminability, affective prediction, optimal decisions and exploratory regulation. I found empirically that there were significant interaction effects of framing and emotion on risk preferences: negative emotions made people more risk-averse in face of gains. When it comes to losses, anger made people more risk-averse and fear more risk seeking. I also characterized how gender and emotion influence confidence and exploratory choice behavior. The theoretical analysis nicely supports empirical findings from human experiments. The new model provides a theory that better explain and simulate human behavior under uncertainty, frames and emotions.",

The goal of the project is to design an environment that facilitates more engaging shared experiences for geographically separated adults and children by placing them together in fantastic worlds and providing tools for them to customize the environment. Standard video mediated technologies provide a live window between remote spaces but do not support users who want to design and interact together in those virtual spaces. We outline the design an implementation of a merged telepresence environment with assets layered in 3D space. The software includes a scene maker and a scene renderer in which users can quickly design digital sets and then play in them together. It supports both physical and digital customization through gestural tools that allow users to seamlessly layer digital and physical content with their bodies. Within the environment users can also transform their appearance and record video. We present the result of pilot studies and a formal evaluation of families using WaaZam in four conditions: separate windows, magic mirror, provided fantastic sets, and self-made sets. Across these conditions we measure dramatic and narrative play patterns, mutuality, social engagement, and physical engagement. Adults and children are interviewed to determine if personalization increases the richness and depth of the user experience. A longitudinal design plan outlines a framework for how this platform could scale beyond the laboratory.

It asserts that the rigid, square, and prefabricated physical materials of computing technology are a fundamental technological and artistic limitation to anyone who wishes to sensually transform physical computing technology, or develop a rich artistic vocabulary for it. Smart and active sculptural computing materials are presented as a solution to this problem. Practically, smart computing materials reduce the number of separate, rigid, and square prefabricated parts required to create physical computing objects. Artistically, active sculptural computing materials give artists and designers the ability to directly manipulate, shape, experiment with, and therefore aesthetically understand the real, physical materials of computing technology. Such active design materials will also enable creative people to develop a meaningful artistic relationship between physical form and computation. The total contributions of this thesis include a proposal for a future three-dimensional design/technology practice, a portfolio of sensually transformed expressive computational objects (including new physical interfaces, electronic fashions, and embroidered musical instruments), and the smart and active sculptural computing materials and processes (in this case smart textiles), which make that transformation possible. Projects from the design portfolio include: The Triangles, and its applications; Electronic Fashions, including the Firefly Dress and Necklace, New Year's Eve Ball Gown, and Serial Suit; The Musical Jacket; Electronic Tablecloths; and a series of Embroidered Musical Instruments with embroidered pressure sensors.

    "abstract": "Obesity is now considered a global epidemic and is predicted to become the number one preventive health threat in the industrialized world. Presently, over 60% of the U.S. adult population is overweight and 30% is obese. This is of concern because obesity is linked to leading causes of death, such as heart and pulmonary diseases, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. The dramatic rise in obesity rates is attributed to an environment that provides easy access to high caloric food and drink and promotes low levels of physical activity. Unfortunately, many people have a poor understanding of their own daily energy (im)balance: the number of calories they consume from food compared with what they expend through physical activity. Accelerometers offer promise as an objective measure of physical activity. In prior work they have been used to estimate energy expenditure and activity type. This work further demonstrates how wireless accelerometers can be used for real-time automatic recognition of physical activity type, intensity, and duration and estimation of energy expenditure. The parameters of the algorithms such as type of classifier/regressor, feature set, window length, signal preprocessing, sensor set utilized and their placement on the human body are selected by performing a set of incremental experiments designed to identify sets of parameters that may balance system usability with robust, real-time performance in low processing power devices such as mobile phones. The algorithms implemented are evaluated using a dataset of examples of 52 activities collected from 20 participants at a gymnasium and a residential home. The algorithms presented here may ultimately allow for the development of mobile phone-based just-in-time interventions to increase self-awareness of physical activity patterns and increases in physical activity levels in real-time during free-living that scale to large populations.",

    "abstract": "Non-hierarchical, participatory, consensus-based decision making has seen an explosion in popularity in recent years. The traditional techniques of formal consensus, however, are limited to face-to-face meetings, which can limit organizations' capacity due to their time and cost. InterTwinkles is a set of integrated but composable online tools designed to assist small and medium-sized groups in engaging in formal group decision making processes online.

These support the concept of Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs), a genre of human-computer interaction that uses spatially reconfigurable physical objects as representations and controls for digital information.

In these interfaces, physical tokens act as containers and parameters for referencing digital information elements and aggregates. Physical constraints are then used to map structured compositions of tokens onto a variety of computational interpretations. This approach is supported through the design and implementation of several systems. The mediaBlocks system enables people to use physical blocks to \"copy and paste\" digital media between specialized devices and general-purpose computers, and to physically compose and edit this content (e.g., to build multimedia presentations).

    "abstract": "In a task domain characterized by physical actions and where information has value, competing teams gain advantage by spying on and deceiving an opposing team while cooperating teammates can help the team by secretly communicating new information. For a robot to thrive in this environment it must be able to perform actions in a manner to deceive opposing agents as well as to be able to secretly communicate with friendly agents. It must further be able to extract information from observing the actions of other agents. The goal of this research is to expand on current human robot interaction by creating a robot that can operate in the above scenario. To enable these behaviors, an architecture is created which provides the robot with mechanisms to work with hidden human mental states. The robot attempts to infer these hidden states from observable factors and use them to better understand and predict behavior. It also takes steps to alter them in order to change the future behavior of the other agent. It utilizes the knowledge that the human is performing analogous inferences about the robot's own internal states to predict the effect of its actions on the human's knowledge and perceptions of the robot. The research focuses on the implicit communication that is made possible by two embodied agents interacting in a shared space through nonverbal interaction. While the processes used by a robot differ significantly from the cognitive mechanisms employed by humans, each face the similar challenge of completing the loop from sensing to acting. This architecture employs a self-as-simulator strategy, reusing the robot's behavioral mechanisms to model aspects of the human's mental states. This reuse allows the robot to model human actions and the mental states behind them using the grammar of its own representations and actions.",

Concepts for flying machines and the ideas behind today's exoskeletons were recorded as early as the 13th century.

This thesis explores a vision of humans and machines symbiotically working together on a task through co-action and coagency. This vision opens up many opportunities in between the extremes of autonomous robots and master-slave systems, through more complex systems in which human and machine collaborate to perform actions and manipulate robotic extensions. This dissertation also reports on three extensive experiments, each consisting of multiple iterations of actual, tested designs: a series of robotic extra-numerary finger robots for increasing manual dexterity, a series of collaborative human-drone drawing systems enabling novel expressive capability, and a series of semi-automated guitar systems enabling extended musical expression as well as new instrument-learning opportunities. The studies performed with these prototypes give insight into the impact of such robotic integration on the human user: the user is nudged to adapt to the new condition and re-calibrate the expectations associated with certain input actions; the division of roles allows the user to explore and understand experiences outside their given skills or physical limits; and the robotic extension inspires activity outside of the user's regular practice. Finally, the thesis also defines a design space and corresponding terminology to situate different technical and design choices for these new forms of human-robot integration. I categorize some of the existing approaches based on how human and robotic actions are coordinated, and how the robotic movements are controlled. I also propose ways to qualitatively describe the interaction between human and machine, in terms of how the robotic extension may affect the cognition and behaviors of its user.

    "abstract": "For people living with limb amputation, the prosthetic socket - the interface between the residuum and prosthesis - is the most critical component. When a socket is uncomfortable, especially due to poor fit, the quality of life for a patient is greatly hindered. However, conventional design of sockets is largely artisan, with limited input of quantitative data. Current computer-aided and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) designs are still not clinically applicable solutions. Due to model identification procedures that employ non patient-specific and incomplete data sets, today's finite element (FE) models of the residuum are not predictive, leading to suboptimal socket designs. As such, there exists a need for a comprehensive biomechanical model of the residuum for the quantitative design and computational evaluation of patient-specific prosthetic sockets. This thesis presents a combined experimental-numerical approach to evaluate and validate a transtibial residuum biomechanical model. The central hypothesis of the work is that a single biomechanical model can predict the large non-linear response at various sites on a residuum under load. To evaluate this hypothesis, a non-linear, two-tissue model was formulated where tissue geometries were defined using MRI data of the residuum. The non-linear viscoelastic material parameters of the model were identified through inverse FEA-based optimization using in-vivo indentation experimental data at four locations. Using optimized model tissue parameters, the mean percentage error (mean absolute error/ maximum experimental force) between the experimental and simulation force-time curves at 14 other locations across the evaluated transtibial residuum was 7 ± 3%. Using this same modeling methodology and a single set of material constants to describe the bulk soft tissue biomechanical response of seven distinct transtibial residual limb models, the average percentage error for indentations at multiple locations across all seven limbs was 7 ± 1%. From these predictive models of residuum limbs, one rigid novel socket and two multimaterial transtibial sockets were designed, fabricated and evaluated through an entirely quantitative, automated and repeatable methodology. In a preliminary clinical investigation, the novel sockets were shown to reduce peak contact pressures at the tibia and fibular head regions on the residuum by significant amounts during standing compared to a conventional socket interface designed and fabricated by a trained prosthetist.",

    "title": "A substrate for accountable layered systems",
    "abstract": "A system built on a layered reflective cognitive architecture presents many novel and difficult software engineering problems. Some of these problems can be ameliorated by erecting the system on a substrate that implicitly supports tracing the behavior of the system to the data and through the procedures that produced that behavior. Good traces make the system accountable; it enables the analysis of success and failure, and thus enhances the ability to learn from mistakes. This constructed substrate provides for general parallelism and concurrency, while supporting the automatic collection of audit trails for all processes, including the processes that analyze audit trails. My system natively supports a Lisp-like language. In such a language, as in machine language, a program is data that can be easily manipulated by a program, making it easier for a user or an automatic procedure to read, edit, and write programs as they are debugged. Constructed within this substrate is an implementation of the bottom four layers of an Emotion Machine cognitive architecture, including built-in reactive, learned reactive, deliberative, and reflective layers. A simple natural language planning language is presented for the deliberative control of a problem domain. Also, a number of deliberative planning algorithms are implemented in this natural planning language, allowing a recursive application of reflectively planned control. This recursion is demonstrated in a fifth super-reflective layer of planned control of the reflective planning layer, implying N reflective layers of planned control. Here, I build and demonstrate an example of reflective problem solving through the use of English plans in a block building problem domain. In my demonstration an AI model can learn from experience of success or failure. The Al not only learns about physical activities but also reflectively learns about thinking activities, refining and learning the utility of built-in knowledge. Procedurally traced memory can be used to assign credit to those thinking processes that are responsible for the failure, facilitating learning how to better plan for these types of problems in the future.",

Some of these problems can be ameliorated by erecting the system on a substrate that implicitly supports tracing the behavior of the system to the data and through the procedures that produced that behavior. Good traces make the system accountable; it enables the analysis of success and failure, and thus enhances the ability to learn from mistakes. This constructed substrate provides for general parallelism and concurrency, while supporting the automatic collection of audit trails for all processes, including the processes that analyze audit trails. My system natively supports a Lisp-like language. In such a language, as in machine language, a program is data that can be easily manipulated by a program, making it easier for a user or an automatic procedure to read, edit, and write programs as they are debugged. Constructed within this substrate is an implementation of the bottom four layers of an Emotion Machine cognitive architecture, including built-in reactive, learned reactive, deliberative, and reflective layers. A simple natural language planning language is presented for the deliberative control of a problem domain. Also, a number of deliberative planning algorithms are implemented in this natural planning language, allowing a recursive application of reflectively planned control. This recursion is demonstrated in a fifth super-reflective layer of planned control of the reflective planning layer, implying N reflective layers of planned control. Here, I build and demonstrate an example of reflective problem solving through the use of English plans in a block building problem domain. In my demonstration an AI model can learn from experience of success or failure. The Al not only learns about physical activities but also reflectively learns about thinking activities, refining and learning the utility of built-in knowledge. Procedurally traced memory can be used to assign credit to those thinking processes that are responsible for the failure, facilitating learning how to better plan for these types of problems in the future."

    "abstract": "Tangible Media as an area has not explored how the tangible handle is more than a marker or place-holder for digital data. Tangible Media can do more. It has the power to materialize and redefine our conception of space and content during the creative process. It can vary from an abstract token that represents a movie to an anthropomorphic plush that reflects the behavior of a sibling during play. My work begins by extending tangible concepts of representation and token-based interactions into movie editing and play scenarios. Through several design iterations and research studies, I establish tangible technologies to drive visual and oral perspectives along with finalized creative works, all during a child's play and exploration. I define the framework, Gesture Object Interfaces, expanding on the fields of Tangible User Interaction and Gesture Recognition. Gesture is a mechanism that can reinforce or create the anthropomorphism of an object. It can give the object life. A Gesture Object is an object in hand while doing anthropomorphized gestures. Gesture Object Interfaces engender new visual and narrative perspectives as part of automatic film assembly during children's play. I generated a suite of automatic film assembly tools accessible to diverse users. The tools that I designed allow for capture, editing and performing to be completely indistinguishable from one another. Gestures integrated with objects become a coherent interface on top of natural play. I built a distributed, modular camera environment and gesture interaction to control that environment. The goal of these new technologies is to motivate children to take new visual and narrative perspectives. In this dissertation I present four tangible platforms that I created as alternatives to the usual fragmented and sequential capturing, editing and performing of narratives available to users of current storytelling tools. I developed Play it by Eye, Frame it by hand, a new generation of narrative tools that shift the frame of reference from the eye to the hand, from the viewpoint (where the eye is) to the standpoint (where the hand is). In Play it by Eye, Frame it by Hand environments, children discover atypical perspectives through the lens of everyday objects. When using Picture This!, children imagine how an object would appear relative to the viewpoint of the toy. They iterate between trying and correcting in a world of multiple perspectives. The results are entirely new genres of child-created films, where children finally capture the cherished visual idioms of action and drama. I report my design process over the course of four tangible research projects that I evaluate during qualitative observations with over one hundred 4- to 14-year-old users. Based on these research findings, I propose a class of moviemaking tools that transform the way users interpret the world visually, and through storytelling.",

    "abstract": "We describe theoretical and practical aspects of the particle trap as an inertial sensor. The insight motivating this approach is that a trapped particle acts like a mass on a spring, but the restoring forces are provided by electrostatic fields. Exquisitely machined physical mechanisms can be replaced by carefully tuned mechanical physics. Such inertial sensors could be simpler to build yet exhibit superior performance because their operating parameters can be dynamically controlled. Most currently available inertial sensors are inherently planar devices that obtain no more than two degrees of motional sensitivity from a given proof mass. The availability of an accurate, inexpensive, integrated six-degree-of-freedom inertial sensor would enable new applications of inertial sensing that are presently either infeasible or unconsidered. By adding inertial terms to the Paul trap dynamics we derive classical observables that depend on the local acceleration field. We also confirm that these observables appear in practice, in what we believe to be the first electrodynamic particle trap accelerometer. An important (and unusual) aspect of our accelerometer is its dynamic tunability: its effective spring constant depends on the trap drive parameters. Our roughly constructed trap also exhibits a large region of linear response to acceleration, and we present evidence suggesting that our accelerometer has performance comparable to commercially available sensors.",

    "abstract": "This thesis describes the processes of teacher learning and explores the associated changes that take place in classrooms. It describes the Adventures in Modeling Workshops, which we designed and created to introduce teachers to the process of conceptualizing, building, and analyzing their own models of complex, dynamic systems. The Workshops facilitate the growth of a modeling culture among teachers by giving them the tools and the ability to pose, investigate, and answer their own questions. This research examines the development, sustainability, and impact of that culture. It describes how participation in a modeling culture can contribute to a scientific way of thinking, for both teachers and their students, and can help teachers bring authentic science practice into high school classrooms. Employing technological tools developed at the Media Lab, we crafted an introduction to scientific modeling for teachers. These tools, used in concert with a constructionist pedagogy of design and creation, enable teachers to become full-fledged practitioners of modeling. Our workshop structure supports teachers as they learn to act as scientists, creating and exploring models of phenomena in the world around them, evaluating and critiquing those models, refining and validating their own mental models, and improving their understandings. This work serves as a proof of concept for a structure and methodology that increases teachers' individual capacities and helps them integrate aspects of their learning into their own classes. It examines the role that new media plays in supporting new ways of thinking and enabling explorations of new domains of knowledge. It also serves as a platform for examining the details of three components of educational change: 1) the development of technology-enabled materials and activities for teacher and student learning, 2) the construction of a scientific culture among teachers through learning about, gaining fluency with, and exploring modeling technologies, and 3) the paths toward implementation of new content and educational approaches in teachers' classrooms.

More recently, scientist have started to delve into decision making to understand why the way we act differs from rational choice, and indeed from our own desires. We believe that it is possible to use just-in-time feedback drawn from machine-observable behavior to help align behavior with personal goals. This dissertation presents mental prosthetics, a model for distributed, embodied, design-embedded, just-in-time interfaces that augment the human judgment process. Drawing information from the activity of the user around them, mental prostheses analyze behavioral patterns in a way orthogonal to human cognition. Unlike persuasive interfaces, mental prostheses attempt to align choices with personal goals by cueing the user with just-in-time information. Lastly, these devices provide calm yet understandable feedback to draw the user's attention at the correct time to the information available to them. This dissertation provides several prototypes and design explorations as a means of sampling the various approaches to data collection, synthesis, and feedback. Focusing on self-reflection, these sample designs form a subclass of mental prostheses that we term reflectOns. We show through the studies carried out in the course of this dissertation that these systems are effective in changing behavior to be better aligned with user goals. Lastly, this dissertation provides a set of design guidelines that assist in the creation of new mental prostheses.

Recent years have seen rapid growth in Big Data methodologies throughout scientific research, business analytics, and online services.

The scale and complexity of these datasets pose significant challenges in the design of effective tools for navigation and analysis. This work will explore methods of representing large datasets as physical, navigable environments. Much of the related research on first person interfaces and 3D visualization has focused on producing tools for expert users and scientific analysis. Due to the complexities of navigation and perception introduced by 3D interfaces, work in this area has had mixed results. In particular, considerable efforts to develop 3D systems for more abstract data, like file systems and social networks, have had difficulty surpassing the efficiency of 2D approaches. However, 3D may offer advantages that have been less explored in this context. In particular, data visualization can be a valuable tool for disseminating scientific results, sharing insights, and explaining methodology. In these applications, clear communication of concepts and narratives are often more essential than efficient navigation. This dissertation will present novel visualization systems designed for large datasets that include audio-video recordings, social media, and others.

    "abstract": "In today's digital era, elements of anyone's life can be captured, by themselves or others, and be instantly broadcast. With little or no regulation on the proliferation of camera technology and the increasing use of video for social communication, entertainment, and education, we have undoubtedly entered the age of ubiquitous media. A world permeated by connected video devices promises a more democratized approach to mass-media culture, enabling anyone to create and distribute personalized content. While these advancements present a plethora of possibilities, they are not without potential negative effects, particularly with regard to privacy, ownership, and the general decrease in quality associated with minimal barriers to entry.

    "text": "Creating cohesive video with the narrative-informed use of ubiquitous wearable and imaging sensor networks In today's digital era, elements of anyone's life can be captured, by themselves or others, and be instantly broadcast. With little or no regulation on the proliferation of camera technology and the increasing use of video for social communication, entertainment, and education, we have undoubtedly entered the age of ubiquitous media. A world permeated by connected video devices promises a more democratized approach to mass-media culture, enabling anyone to create and distribute personalized content. While these advancements present a plethora of possibilities, they are not without potential negative effects, particularly with regard to privacy, ownership, and the general decrease in quality associated with minimal barriers to entry.

    "title": "A 3D neuromuscular model of the human ankle-foot complex based on multi-joint biplanar fluoroscopy gait analysis",
    "abstract": "During the gait cycle, the human ankle complex serves as a primary power generator while simultaneously stabilizing the entire limb. These actions are controlled by an intricate interplay of several lower leg muscles that cannot be fully uncovered using experimental methods alone. A combination of experiments and mathematical modeling may be used to estimate aspects of neuromusculoskeletal functions that control human gait. In this research, a three-dimensional neuromuscular model of the human ankle-foot complex based on biplanar fluoroscopy gait analysis is presented. Biplanar fluoroscopy (BiFlo) enables three-dimensional bone kinematics analysis using x-ray videos and bone geometry from segmented CT. Hindered by a small capture volume relative to traditional optical motion capture (MOCAP), BiFlo applications to human movement are generally limited to single-joint motions with constrained range. Here, a hybrid procedure is developed for multi-joint gait analysis using BiFlo and MOCAP in tandem. MOCAP effectively extends BiFlo's field-of-view. Subjects walked at a self-selected pace along a level walkway while BiFlo, MOCAP, and ground reaction forces were collected. A novel methodology was developed to register separate BiFlo measurements of the knee and ankle-foot complex. Kinematic analysis of bones surrounding the knee, ankle, and foot was performed. Kinematics obtained using this technique were compared to those calculated using only MOCAP during stance phase. Results show that this hybrid protocol effectively measures knee and ankle kinematics in all three body planes. Additionally, sagittal plane kinematics for select foot bone segments (proximal phalanges, metatarsals, and midfoot) was realized. The proposed procedure offers a novel approach to human gait analysis that eliminates errors originated by soft tissue artifacts, and is especially useful for ankle joint analysis, whose complexities are often simplified in MOCAP studies. Outcomes of the BiFlo walking experiments helped guide the development of a three-dimensional neuromuscular model of the human ankle-foot complex. Driven by kinematics, kinetics, and electromyography (EMG), the model seeks to solve the redundancy problem, individual muscle-tendon contributions to net joint torque, in ankle and subtalar joint actuation during overground gait. Kinematics and kinetics from BiFlo walking trials enable estimations of muscle-tendon lengths, moment arms, and joint torques. EMG yields estimates of muscle activation. Using each of these as inputs, an optimization approach was employed to calculate sets of morphological parameters that simultaneously maximize the neuromuscular model's metabolic efficiency and fit to experimental joint torques. This approach is based on the hypothesis that the muscle-tendon morphology of the human leg has evolved to maximize metabolic efficiency of walking at self-selected speed. Optimal morphological parameter sets produce estimates of force contributions and states for individual muscles. This research lends insight into the possible roles of individual muscle-tendons in the leg that lead to efficient gait.",

    "abstract": "This thesis carries out a series of studies and develops a methodology and tools to measure and analyze ambulatory physiological, behavioral and social data from wearable sensors and mobile phones with trait data such as personality, for learning about behaviors and traits that impact human health and wellbeing. This thesis also validates the methodology and tools on a selected subset of the questions that can be answered by the data collected. First, I conducted a study to characterize wrist electrodermal activity (EDA) patterns with concurrent polysomnography and conventional palm EDA measurement. I developed a tool to analyze the EDA data quantitatively and found that wrist EDA peaks occur during Non REM2 and 3 sleep. Then, with multi-modal wearable sensor data, I conducted several studies showing how multi-modal wearable sensors can improve characterization of sleep/wake states over motion-sensing alone, and predict sleep-related memory consolidation. We found that wrist-EDA helps discriminate when there is improved sleep-related memory consolidation. Next, with colleagues at MIT and Brigham and Women's hospital, I designed and carried out the first four semesters of the \"SNAPSHOT study\", which measured over 100,000 hours of multi-sensor and smartphone use data from 168 college students, recruited together with their social groups. Each student contributed intensive multi-modal ambulatory data (physiological, behavioral, environmental, and social) for 30 days. Each student also filled out standardized questionnaires on mental health, personality, stress, social interactions, sleep and GPA, and provided a measure of dim light melatonin, enabling circadian phase to be measured. To investigate the value of the data, I examined a subset of the large set of questions that these new data enable us to answer: I examined the associations between sleep regularity and sleep duration on academic performance, physical/mental health, perceived stress and wellbeing-related measures using coarsened exact matching to control covariates. Our data showed that sleep irregularity was statistically significantly more associated with bad health, reported in the morning, and with worse mental health than sleep duration. I also identified features useful for recognition of monthly reported perceived stress (high vs low): daily activities, personality, sleep, physiology, social interactions, phone usage, and mobility.",

    "abstract": "Multitasking environments cause people to be interrupted constantly, often disrupting their ongoing activities and impeding reaching their goals. This thesis presents a disruption reducing approach designed to support the user's goals and optimize productivity that is based on a model of the user's receptivity to an interruption. The model uses knowledge of the interruption content, context and priority of the task(s) in progress, user actions and goal-related concepts to mediate interruptions. The disruption management model is distinct from previous work by the addition of implicit sensors that deduce the interruption content and user context to help determine when an interruption will disrupt an ongoing activity. Domain-independent implicit sensors include mouse and keyboard behaviors, and goal-related concepts extracted from the user documents. The model also identifies the contextual relationship between interruptions and user goals as an important factor in how interruptions are controlled. The degree to which interruptions are related to the user goal determines how those interruptions will be received. We tested and evolved the model in various cases and showed significant improvement in both productivity and satisfaction. A disruption manager application controls interruptions on common desktop computing activities, such as web browsing and instant messaging. The disruption manager demonstrates that mediating interruptions by supporting the user goals can improve performance and overall productivity.

Increasingly, webbased services allow professional and non-professional audiences to access computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) tools like 3D-printing and laser-cutting. Nonetheless, there are few (if any) design tools and methods for creating complex mechanical assemblies that take full advantage of CAM systems. Creating unique mechatronic artifacts or \"originalMachines\" requires more specific and sophisticated design tools than exist today. \"Object-Oriented Mechatronics\" is a parametric design approach that connects knowledge about mechanical assemblies and electronics with the requirements of digital manufacturing processes. Parametric instances like gears, bearing and servos are made available as objects within a CAD environment which can then be implemented into specific projects. The approach addresses the missing link between accessible rapid-manufacturing services and currently available design tools thereby creating new opportunities for self-expression through mechatronic objects and machines. The dissertation matches mechanical components and assemblies with rapid manufacturing methods by exploring transferability of conventional manufacturing techniques to appropriate rapid manufacturing tools.

The annotated subset of this data spans the child's 9-24 month age range and contains more than 8 million words of transcribed speech, constituting a detailed record of both the child's input and linguistic development. Such a comprehensive, naturalistic dataset presents new research opportunities but also requires new analysis approaches - questions must be operationalized to leverage the full scale of the data. We begin with the task of speech transcription, then identify \"word births\" - the child's first use of each word in his vocabulary. Vocabulary growth accelerates and then shows a surprising deceleration that coincides with an increase in combinatorial speech. The vocabulary growth timeline provides a means to assess the environmental contributions to word learning, beginning with aspects of caregiver input speech.

    "abstract": "This dissertation describes the research, development and reasoning behind a family of musical instruments called Exertion Instruments. They use inline electrical generators to run a synthesizer and an amplifier while eliminating the need for batteries. Efficient acoustic design minimizes the power requirements while optimized generator and ergonomic design maximize power generation. As such, they combine the convenience of acoustic instruments with the flexibility of electronic instruments. Also, through new generator designs, nuances of player charging movements become as important to expression as the overall intensity of their playing. The player treats the generator like a typical physical resonator such as a string, using musical instrument playing gestures.

    "text": "Exertion instruments This dissertation describes the research, development and reasoning behind a family of musical instruments called Exertion Instruments. They use inline electrical generators to run a synthesizer and an amplifier while eliminating the need for batteries. Efficient acoustic design minimizes the power requirements while optimized generator and ergonomic design maximize power generation. As such, they combine the convenience of acoustic instruments with the flexibility of electronic instruments. Also, through new generator designs, nuances of player charging movements become as important to expression as the overall intensity of their playing. The player treats the generator like a typical physical resonator such as a string, using musical instrument playing gestures. Yet they manipulate audio electronically, enabling practices like sampling, synthesis and modulation. During development, a modular approach using amateur-friendly materials was taken to empower future instrument builders to customize and improve the instrument. In addition to technical criteria based on measurements, Exertion Instruments are evaluated through player and builder experiences in a series of technical workshops and realworld performances."

This culture introduces new expectations and new opportunities for learning, creating new demands for what to learn and offering new possibilities for how to learn. In this dissertation, I adopt a predominantly qualitative approach to exploring learning in computational culture, studying how the Scratch programming environment and online community are employed to support learning both in and out of school. To this end, I conducted interviews with 30 kids working with Scratch at home and 30 teachers working with Scratch in K-12 classrooms to develop descriptions of computational creation in these two settings. Using a theoretical framework of agency and structure, I analyze how the at-home and school-classroom contexts enable - or constrain - young people's agency in computational creation. Despite common assumptions that at-home learning is necessarily low-structure/high-agency and that at-school learning is necessarily high-structure/low-agency, I argue that structure and agency need not be in opposition. Designers of learning environments should explore intermediate possibilities, finding ways to employ structure in the service of learner agency.",

However, the discussion of the subject has suffered from the lack of stochastic tools to quantitatively capture both the subtler steps of the problem solution process and the diversity of human thinking. In order to stochastically model the human problem solution, this thesis presents an approach referred to as \"influence modeling,\" that attempts to describe how an individual navigates from one random memory chunk to another related memory chunk, and how a group of people randomly remind one another of memory chunks that could be individually uncommon. As an application of influence modeling, this thesis shows how groups play \"20-questions\" games based on a semantic space, such as ConceptNet (a common-sense database). It also investigates how groups send signals about their behavior, which are collected by embedded devices, how group interaction processes could be automatically monitored with embedded devices, how group performance could be facilitated, and how to map group behavior and performance from the macroscopic level to the microscopic level in experiments in measuring collective intelligence. The influence modeling makes it possible to understand how a group could perform better than an individual. It also allows for the monitoring of the status of the problem solution, and makes it possible to direct group interaction in more fruitful ways.",

    "abstract": "The major promise of computational technology for learning is in making discovery and acquisition of knowledge accessible to a wider range of people. The protean expressive and constructive nature of computational technology facilitates more powerful and effective learning methodologies. Enabling multiple forms of representation through computational approaches to thinking about various phenomena not only potentially opens new domains of knowledge, but also permits a re-structuration of domains by rethinking content and activity. This thesis provides an exemplar of this potential through children learning about Balance Control in Dynamic Systems (BCDS), which adds a particular value given that BCDS is considered too complex for young learners. A Balance Control Microworld was created to help learners think about how to program physical robots to perform balancing acts, such as balancing an inverted pendulum, based on the observations of their own body motions. A Spatial Computing Paradigm (SCP) was developed to allow learners to carry out various control operations using familiar 2D properties of on-screen objects. The physical robots have a dual-mode ability that allowed learners to record and observe motions while controlling the robots manually by hand as well as under program control. The study involved two groups of learners, ages 13 to 15, over twelve months. BCDS concepts that emerged include the role of speed, creating predictions, managing system states, and analyzing system's stability. Moreover, powerful ideas in computational and mathematical thinking helped enable thinking and understanding in BCDS as well as reflection over the whole process.

    "abstract": "The current but inconsistent upheaval in the Middle East suggests variations in what will topple regimes, and thus in how regimes have laid the groundwork to remain in power. This thesis examines variation in a social condition, relative dominance of a ruling ethnic group in a multi-ethnic society, as the source for systematic variations in how a mono-ethnic regime will justify its rule to the general population. This thesis argues that the ruling group's relative dominance, defined as its relative percentage to other groups in the population, drives a regime's justifying argument to be either rooted in the presence of universally lauded institutions (democratic-institutional), the regime's demonstrated record of economic and social developmental achievements (economic-social developmental), or the regime's ability to further the interests of an identity common to itself and the population at large (identificational). Relative dominance, it is contended, affects regime behavior by influencing the functioning of two mechanisms: the degree to which a regime can tolerate public accountability and the extent to which it needs to reduce the salience of ethnicity in order to endure. The thesis hypothesizes that the former decreases and the latter increases as dominance decreases. The thesis incorporates quantitative and qualitative analyses to measure and evaluate relationships between relative dominance and justifying arguments. It demonstrates the existence of relationships between dominance and regimes' justifying arguments by means of content analysis of senior leaders' speeches in eight Sunni-dominant, Shi'ite-subordinate countries--Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq (under Saddam Hussein), Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Case studies of one high-dominance country (the UAE), one medium-dominance (Yemen), one low-dominance (Iraq), and one outlier (Bahrain) then illustrate the speculated mechanisms in action.",

    "abstract": "Much ink has been spilled on the way justifications for and patterns of military intervention have changed, particularly since the end of the Cold War. One aspect of intervention that has not been well explored in this literature, however, is jurisdictional allocation, or which country should try service members who commit crimes while deployed overseas. The sending country normally seeks to retain jurisdiction to protect their service members from criminal systems that may expose them to human rights abuses or lower legal standards than they would enjoy at home. Host countries, on the other hand, often argue against this violation of their sovereignty, which undercuts their legal institutions and ability to regulate internal order. What have been the trends in jurisdictional allocation over time? Has it been consistently allocated to host countries or sending countries, and how has this been justified? What could explain these trends? I explore this question using two cases. The first case focuses on the allocation of jurisdiction in UN peacekeeping Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs) from 1948-2013, and debates in the 2000s over reforming jurisdictional allocation in the UN's model SOFA and Memorandum of Understanding in light of allegations of rape committed by UN peacekeepers on mission. The second case looks at negotiations surrounding the US-Iraq SOFA in 2008 and 2011. Overall, I argue that patterns of SOFA jurisdictional allocation have consistently favoured the sending country. This is better explained by state interests, or sometimes a mix of interests and norms, rather than norms alone. This paper ultimately points to the need to take a more nuanced look at the dynamics of interventions, which may follow different patterns over time. In other words, not all aspects of intervention may be evolving in the same way.",

    "title": "Strategic goods provision in Hezbollah's resistance",
    "abstract": "The provision of goods and services is thought to be a key way that groups are able to gain political power. However, current work has offered a highly fragmentary view of what specific gains can be made with what type of goods provision, and what potential interaction between strategies might exist. This paper integrates key rational actor and electoral models, and tests the resulting predictions against empirical data on Hezbollah's provision of goods and services. Two basic types of models link success in violent contestation to the provision of goods to a restricted community and success in electoral contestation to provision of broadly accessible goods and services. However, across several major types of goods and services Hezbollah consistently provided easily accessible good far before they considered participating in elections, provided more accessible goods relative to restricted goods then can be explained by the importance of electoral and violent contestation, and expanded or contracted the scope of provision at points in time that do not correspond to strategic shifts. As an alternative, I suggest that goods may be geographically rather than temporally strategic, a need to create compliance among the population, and the need to create a sense of agency within the Shia population to increase proactive support for the resistance may be greater drivers of goods provision then has been explored.",

    "abstract": "I evaluate the practical utility of psychological bias theory by examining two historical cases - the US decision to cross the 38th parallel in 1950 and the British policy of appeasement towards Germany in the 1930s - asking in each of these whether the theory could have helped policymakers to make better decisions. Drawing from the lessons of these two cases, I argue that psychological bias theory can help foreign-policymakers to improve their decisionmaking capabilities and hence increase their chances of achieving favorable outcomes in international politics. However, even if the prescriptions of the theory are adopted, there is no guarantee that positive outcomes will obtain in every case because outcomes are affected by at least two other factors that one largely cannot control: the availability of information and the misperceptions suffered by one's opponent. I also discuss other research methods that could be used to investigate the utility of the theory: examining how useful its prescriptions have been; looking at whether people can actually correct their psychological biases; and considering whether policymakers should attempt to rectify their biases.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear Proliferation is a complex problem that has plagued national security strategists since the advent of the first nuclear weapons. As the cost to produce nuclear weapons has continued to decline and the availability of nuclear material has become more widespread, the threat of proliferation has increased. The spread of technology and the globalization of the information age has made the threat not only more likely, but also more difficult to detect. Proliferation experts do not agree on the universal factors which cause nations to want to proliferate or the methods to prevent countries from successfully developing nuclear weapons.

This disparity presents a problem to decision makers who are tasked with preventing further nuclear proliferation. Bayesian Inference is a tool of quantitative analysis that is rapidly gaining interest in numerous fields of scientific study that have previously been limited to purely statistical methods. The Bayesian approach removes the statistical limitations of large-n data sets and strictly numerical types of data. It allows researchers to include sparse and rich data as well as qualitative data based on the opinions of subject matter experts. Bayesian inference allows the inclusion of both the quantitative data and subjective judgments in the determination of predictions about a theory of interest. This means that contrary to classic statistical methods, we can now make accurate predictions with reduced information and apply this probabilistic method to problems in social science.

    "abstract": "This thesis argues that regime legitimacy creates military resilience. A regime is legitimate when its constituents believe-whether because of ideological solidarity, patriotism, nationalism, or good governance-that a government has the right to exercise authority in its regime. Military resilience, which contributes to military effectiveness, refers to the willingness of troops to stay committed in combat. In modern war, dispersion of forces creates the need for a very high degree of troop commitment, making resilience more important than in previous forms of warfare. Resilient units do not disintegrate through desertion, and furthermore commit themselves actively under fire. In arguing that legitimacy matters, this thesis revives a debate between two theories of military resilience. The first school, which comes out of the tradition of the mass army, holds that broad attributes like legitimacy, patriotism, and nationalism are crucial to resilience. In recent political science, a second school has been significantly more influential; these scholars argue that factors like small-unit cohesion and professionalism are the key explanatory variables for military resilience. Settling the debate between these competing methods of generating resilience is critical to effective army building. This thesis strongly supports a revival of the first school of thought, based on the evidence from two cases where legitimacy experienced a sudden shock.

While the spread of elections has reached all the continents, the number of actual democracies has not increased at a comparable rate. If anything, observers have learned that the presence of elections in a country does not necessarily mean that it is also a democracy. This thesis addresses an underexplored topic in the study of electoral politics: the manipulation of election systems in order to achieve selective representation. I focus on the experience of opposition parties in two cases, Jordan and Turkey, an autocracy and a democracy, to analyze the impact of engineered election mechanisms on their representation.

This is done by different mechanisms, depending on the makeup of the country and the options available to the manipulators. Mechanisms of electoral systems are used to reduce the representation of groups that are considered a threat, and to amplify the representation of those groups that the regime would like to strengthen. Analyzing the effect of malapportioned seats and the use of a single non-transferable voting system in Jordan on the Islamic Action Front Party (IAF), the main political rival to traditional tribal politicians, I expose the power of these targeted electoral mechanisms for control.

    "abstract": "In the approaches seen at the six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear program, why did states faced with the same security problem adopt different strategies? Answering this question will bring understanding to why the process has proceeded in fits and starts, as the countries negotiating with Pyongyang - China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, and the United States - often struggle to coordinate strategy in their quest to resolve a grave issue of international security. This paper approaches the question by taking up three possible drivers behind strategy among the five negotiating countries - realist calculations, domestic political institutions, and national identity - and, tracing each country's strategy within the talks, identifies the most likely of these drivers for each state. This study finds that while the United States, China, and Russia bring primarily realist concerns to the table, they employ separate strategies toward the North Korean nuclear issue, reflecting differing drivers and goals. In addition, South Korea and Japan see their strategies driven by issues related to national identity and domestic politics. In looking at the origins of these drivers, this study finds that China's realist drive stems largely from its particular vision of economic and geopolitical growth; Japan's push for a resolution to the kidnapping issue stems from politicians' aim for domestic political popularity made easier through Japan's lack of a history of relations with North Korea; Russia's realist drive derives from the Putin-led push to regain a semblance of its historical sphere of influence;",

This paper studies the possibility of a South Korean counterinvasion against North Korea by looking at the qualitative combat dynamics and performing a formal campaign analyses based on the Korean peninsula's conventional military balance. This study first analyzes the process of the South Korean defensive against the North Korean invasion, and examines South Korea's likely counterinvasion scenarios and assesses their chances of success. These scenarios vary based on North Korea's likely courses of action once its offensive fails, depending on whether the North Koreans retreat to the military demarcation line or hold their position within the South territory. According to this paper's analysis, South Korea is capable of counterinvading North Korea in all the scenarios suggested. South Korea possesses a qualitatively superior force with better readiness and logistics powered by a stronger economy, while the North Koreans lack the force effectiveness necessary to carry out their theory of victory. First, the South Korean forces are capable of fending off a North Korean invasion while inflicting severe damage to the North Koreans; second, the South Korean forces would inflict considerable casualty to the North Koreans during their retreat; finally, the South Korean offensive would be capable of breaking through the weakened North Korean defense. This study makes several contributions. First, it examines the puzzle of South Korean counterinvasion that has been under-discussed despite its political and strategic significance. In doing so, the study presents an opportunity to explain North Korea's recent behaviors and the United States' redefinition of its role involving the peninsula, hence increasing our understanding of the East Asian security dynamics. Second, by providing an updated survey of the peninsula's conventional balance, this study enhances our knowledge in the two Korea's strategic capabilities which have undergone considerable changes.

There is one class of unjust society called \"burdened\" that is not malicious but lacks the political traditions and institutions needed to be well-ordered, and it may also be unable to care for its citizens. Well-ordered societies owe these burdened ones a \"Duty of Assistance\" to help them become well-ordered. Rawls thinks that what they most need is political assistance to create just institutions, and perhaps some small, temporary economic aid for acute crises, for two reasons. Economics teaches that large-scale crises like famine or mass migration are caused by (bad) governments, and aren't inevitable consequences of drought. If a just people wants to prevent large-scale disasters, donating large amounts of cash won't help. The permanent cure is just government. Also, he denies that there are any real countries that have too few resources to support their population.

Second, I argue that (a) primary goods are heterogeneous, and redistribution means different things for different kinds of goods, (b) needs for some of these may be adequately assured by good government, but not just burdened societies can have long-term need for others. The duty of Assistance requires redistribution of more goods, to more types of society than Rawls asserts.

    "abstract": "What if the United States had led its NATO allies to intervene in Syria's civil war in the midst of calls for humanitarian intervention in mid-2012? Despite the importance of this question for the study and evaluation of U.S. foreign policy, little exists in the way of systematic, open-source analysis of the military missions and material requirements for a possible Syrian intervention. This thesis assesses the scale, scope, and challenges of intervention in Syria at the time its proponents argue it would have been most effective. It does so through open-source analysis of a U.S.-led air campaign designed to mitigate the country's humanitarian crisis. The model of intervention analyzed -- broadly conceived as the establishment of safe havens around major Syrian population areas defended from the air -- offers a template for evaluating the utility of air power in the Syrian context more generally. The analysis suggests an intervention in mid-2012 to establish safe havens in Syria would have been a major military undertaking, likely requiring greater resources and facing greater risks than any of NATO's previous air campaigns in response to humanitarian crises in Bosnia, Kosovo, or Libya. The \"low-risk\" rationale for humanitarian intervention from the air thus appears far less persuasive in the Syrian case. The thesis concludes with implications for the application of air power to future humanitarian crises.",

Despite the importance of this question for the study and evaluation of U.S. foreign policy, little exists in the way of systematic, open-source analysis of the military missions and material requirements for a possible Syrian intervention. This thesis assesses the scale, scope, and challenges of intervention in Syria at the time its proponents argue it would have been most effective. It does so through open-source analysis of a U.S.-led air campaign designed to mitigate the country's humanitarian crisis. The model of intervention analyzed -- broadly conceived as the establishment of safe havens around major Syrian population areas defended from the air -- offers a template for evaluating the utility of air power in the Syrian context more generally. The analysis suggests an intervention in mid-2012 to establish safe havens in Syria would have been a major military undertaking, likely requiring greater resources and facing greater risks than any of NATO's previous air campaigns in response to humanitarian crises in Bosnia, Kosovo, or Libya. The \"low-risk\" rationale for humanitarian intervention from the air thus appears far less persuasive in the Syrian case. The thesis concludes with implications for the application of air power to future humanitarian crises."

    "abstract": "Operational surprise attacks are large-scale, theater-level intrawar attacks, which result from a country misestimating the capabilities and intentions of its enemies. This thesis analyzes how these massive surprise attacks occur during war when countries should be especially wary of their enemies and vigilant for any evidence of attack. Three hypotheses may explain the frequency and success of operational surprise attacks including operational secrecy, strategic deception, and intelligence failure. Using the Battle of the Bulge in World War II and the Chinese counteroffensive in the Korean War as case studies, this analysis illustrates these three elements and evaluates their relative causal weight in these attacks. This study concludes that each hypothesis is a contributing element to the surprise attack, but that a failure of intelligence is the critical factor. Moreover, this failure stems from a \"victory disease\" - a belief held by military leaders and their intelligence staff when victory appears near that one's enemy is too weak or has allowed the opportunity to mount a successful counterattack pass.",

    "abstract": "Since the end of the Cold War, 'coercive diplomacy', that is the strategic use of threats aimed at convincing an adversary to stop or undo 'hostile' actions, has become a principle crisis management tool of the Western powers. Yet as a strategy it has a relatively poor track record of success; a record that theorists have struggled to explain. Despite the fact that the majority of such engagements have been undertaken multilaterally, little work to date has focused on the impact that employing a coalitional 'coercing agent' has on the ability to craft a potent package of threats. This study aims to contribute to the debate by testing empirically the impact of coalitional dynamics on the ability of Western powers to employ coercive diplomacy. More specifically, it explores the theoretical tension between the anecdotal assumptions held by certain theorists regarding coalitional action problems (CAP) on the one hand and Jakobsen's four-point ideal policy of coercive diplomacy on the other. I explore this tension through two case studies: the employment of coercive diplomacy by NATO and the Contact Group aimed at halting Serbian aggression in Bosnia between 1992 and 1995 and the Western coalition's attempt to roll back the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The study finds that although CAP do arise as predicted, coalitions have effective mechanisms for overcoming them and thus are able to effectively implement coercive threat packages that approximate to Jakobsen's ideal policy.",

    "abstract": "Recent research suggests that heavily mechanized armies perform worse in counterinsurgency campaigns than those that use fewer vehicles. The U.S. military's 2007 operations in Iraq, however, present an empirical quandary for the mechanization hypothesis: a vehicle-heavy army proved able to suppress an insurgency, allowing Iraqi leaders to work towards a long-term political solution. This paper argues that force employment, not mechanization, drives counterinsurgency outcomes-what matters is not that armies have many vehicles or soldiers, but how they choose to use them. When heavily mechanized forces change their tactics and doctrine to line up with counterinsurgency principles, shifting from an enemy-centric to a population-centric approach, outcomes dramatically improve while military-wide mechanization levels remain constant. Using an original dataset, this paper conducts a large-n regression analysis of the impacts of mechanization at the provincial level in Iraq, and finds little support for the mechanization hypothesis. A subsequent comparative case study, of the heavily mechanized 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment's operations in Tall Afar and the light infantry 82nd Airborne Division's operations in Fallujah, indicate that force employment rather than mechanization is a key indicator of counterinsurgency outcomes. The finding has important implications for force structure policy, as it indicates that mechanized forces can indeed conduct successful counterinsurgency campaigns.",

Australia has developed a relatively generous system of public subsidies to support the provision of care for young children, while at the same time relying increasingly on the market to deliver child care. In contrast, Canada has extremely low levels of public spending and service provision, resulting in a less expansive system of regulated child care. I trace these divergent outcomes to the impact of post-WWII child care policy legacies in these countries and the way that these legacies interact with the changing politics of the welfare state to produce variation. In Canada, child care policy was first established within a social assistance framework as a service intended to combat poverty, while in Australia, child care was introduced as an economic policy to facilitate women's workforce participation. The differences in the intended goals of these policies affected the subsequent patterns of child care politics and policy development in these two countries, leading to the divergent outcomes observed today.",

    "abstract": "This thesis is a study of the causes of \"Konfrontasi\" or Confrontation, the low-intensity war waged by the Republic of Indonesia, under the leadership of President Sukarno, against the Federation of Malaysia, which became independent in 1963. The Confrontation lasted between 1963 and 1966. The thesis compares three categories of hypotheses or arguments for its causes - threat, ideology, and domestic politics - and evaluates each type of argument in tum. The \"threat\" argument claims that Malaysia posed a security threat to Indonesia, and that the Confrontation was the outcome of a security dilemma between both states. The \"threat\" of Malaysia has some substantive elements necessary to justify Indonesian aggression, but it is shown to be largely an exaggerated claim, and does not provide a sufficient motive for the conflict. The \"ideology\" argument claims that the Indonesia Confrontation was driven by the ideology of the Indonesian Revolution and the central role of Indonesia in leading a struggle of New Emerging Forces against the Old Established Forces of neo-colonialism, colonialism and imperialism. It is shown that this argument has more substance than the \"threat\" argument, since Indonesian ideology traces its existence independently to earlier Indonesian historical experience, and Confrontation could not have been rationalized without recourse to ideological principles. However, this thesis also shows how the \"ideology\" hypothesis for Confrontation is over-determined, as Indonesian ideology did not necessarily make Confrontation an inevitable and necessary outcome. Ideology was necessary, but insufficient for motivating the decision to confront Malaysia. Finally, the \"domestic politics\" argument draws its claims from the idea that the Indonesian Confrontation was a \"diversionary war\" against the Malaysia, where the latter filled the role of \"scapegoat,\" \"bogeyman\" or \"safety valve.\" According to this argument, the Confrontation was started in order to contain serious internal disunities in the Indonesian government, most notably between the army and the ascendant communist party, and to unite these conflicting elements in a nationalist cause. This thesis finds the greatest evidence and theoretical support for this \"domestic politics\" explanation of Confrontation, and finds this account to be the most consistent and satisfactory argument.",

There is great variation in the manner the negotiations occurred. The state negotiated with Portugal over East Timor with the United Nations (UN) as mediator while negotiations with the Acehnese were first mediated by the Henry Dunant Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue (HDC) and later the Crisis Management Initiative (CMI). Finally, the state refused any mediators in the case of West Papua, where Indonesia's longest and bloodiest insurgency continues to take place. What explains the variation in the decision to have mediation and the choice of mediators? This is the central question of the thesis. In examining this variation, I hope to contribute to the literature on bargaining in insurgencies as well as examine the effectiveness of mediation, which is disputed. I argue that a state that is not committed or has very low levels of commitment to negotiations will not have a mediator. The more committed the state is to negotiations, the stronger the mediator the state will seek. The level of commitment is a function of the balance of power between the incumbents and insurgents, domestic support, and international pressure for peaceful resolution. Domestic support is the pivotal factor with the military being the most decisive actor. Based on this argument, I develop a scenario-based framework in which states could possibly find themselves in and test it on the three cases of insurgencies in Indonesia. The findings show that the state was more committed to reaching a settlement in East Timor and Aceh than in West Papua and so had mediators to ensure the success of the peace processes, which would not have occurred otherwise. In addition, the findings also suggest that a hurting stalemate is not a necessary precondition for successful mediation, contrary to the literature on mediation.

The model is then used to draw inferences about the forms of counterinsurgency strategies practiced by the US military in the second war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan. The paper argues that militaries tend to view the tasks they undertake in terms of the coercive application of force, and that this tendency tends to determine the forms of counterinsurgency strategies they chose, leading them to eschew strategies that rely on bargaining with enemy forces. The purported dominance of this coercive \"image of operations\" is then investigated in military field reports from the war in Afghanistan."

    "abstract": "Nuclear weapon testing is the final step in the nuclear development process, an announcement of ability and strength. The consequences of a nuclear test are far from easy to bear, however: economic sanctions can be crippling and nuclear capability automatically makes one a nuclear target. Why, then, do states test nuclear weapons? This thesis aims to determine the answer to this question using India as a model. It is well known that India tested nuclear weapons in 1974 and in 1998, but less well known are the near-tests of 1983, 1995, and 1996. This thesis examines the situation in these years and the details of the nuclear decisions based on four hypotheses: technical concerns, security and power, domestic politics, and norms and ideas. This study shows that while all four of these theories play a role, technical concerns (contrary to popular belief) are very minor portion of the overall decision to test a nuclear weapon and are relegated to an excuse for scientists. Domestic politics, especially the political fortunes of those in power, play a large role, especially when combined with real, existential security concerns. Similarly, the prestige and status that leaders believe is imparted by nuclear ability is of major import. Understanding the reasons for nuclear testing will lead to fewer nuclear surprises in the future and may help to address the concerns of the growing number of states with latent nuclear capabilities.",

    "abstract": "An observational study was conducted to determine the most likely explanation of American support for Israel. Several extant hypotheses were considered, most particularly, and at greatest length, that of a pro-Israel domestic lobby in the United States, but also that it had to do with Cold War containment, common values, or precedent. It was ultimately concluded that the domestic lobby hypothesis could not account for American support, since the level of that support correlated negatively with the resources of the lobby, and because sudden, temporary changes in the level of American support did not coincide with any similar changes in the resources of the lobby. Furthermore, statistical analysis indicated that there was on balance no benefit for politicians who supported the lobby's agenda, and no cost for those who opposed it. Likewise, the other explanations also proved unsatisfactory. The containment hypothesis, for instance, could not explain why American support continued after the Cold War ended, while the common values hypothesis could not explain why American support did not begin until 1971, nor why it peaked in 1979 and began to decline in the eighties. Finally, it was concluded that the best explanation of American support was that it gave the United States the leverage to restrain Israeli belligerence, for which the United States was blamed by the Arab states. In this way, the U.S. was able to minimize damage to its relations with the Arabs resulting from the Arab-Israeli conflict.",

This paper uses data from the 2006 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) public opinion poll to measure whether certain electoral problems persisted in the 2006 midterm elections. Of particular concern are whether voters were asked to show photo ID in order to vote, whether voters experienced problems with their registrations upon attempting to vote, what demographic groups experienced these problems most frequently, and what remedies were offered to such voters. Additionally, public opinion on whether all voters should be required to show photo IDs in order to vote and on whether polling stations were well operated in this election is also examined. The data shows that while significant percentages of CCES respondents experienced registration problems when voting and/or were asked to show photo ID before voting almost no respondents were prevented from casting ballots. Respondents showed overwhelming support for measures which would require all voters to show photo ID before voting, though this support varied significantly by party ID. Finally, respondents were overwhelmingly pleased with how their polling stations were operated during this election and very few of them were forced to wait in long lines before voting.",

    "abstract": "Prestige is a term that appears in a wide range of international relations literature, but it is rarely ever defined. There is a vague consensus that prestige involves measures of status and respect, but its exact usage is different in every work. This thesis analyzes the various manifestations of prestige to develop a workable definition of the concept and then uses this definition to show how prestige plays a role in the major foreign policy decisions of states. This thesis argues that prestige motivations can overcome security concerns in some instances and cause a state to take an action that seems irrational. This is especially true if the state has recently suffered a severe drop in prestige, such as one incurred after losing a war, becoming isolated from the international community or facing state collapse. When such a dramatic loss occurs a state must take one of four paths to salvage its lost reputation: winning a war, becoming an economic power, taking the lead on an important political negotiation or developing nuclear weapons. This thesis uses two large case studies - Iran and Egypt - along with three smaller case surveys - France, Japan and Pakistan - to illustrate these four paths of status adjustment in action.

    "abstract": "This thesis explores the congressional politics of the financial services industry in the United States between 1989 and 2008. Three approaches are pursued. First, I provide a detailed account of the major legislation concerning the industry during this period, with particular reference to interest group competition between commercial banks, securities firms and insurance companies and to the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999. I suggest that intraindustry conflict was instrumental in delaying Glass-Steagall's repeal until 1999, but that these eventually faded away in response to events outside the Congressional sphere and gave way to a period of intra-industry cooperation in the years after 1999 because the repeal of Glass-Steagall effectively aligned the interests of industry sub-sectors. Second, I present statistical evidence that suggest that these changes are reflected in the contribution strategies of PACs aligned with the financial services industry. Before the repeal of Glass-Steagall, competing groups within the industry valued certain individual legislator characteristics (above all, various committee memberships) at quite different levels. However, after 1999, the contribution strategies of the industry sub-sectors converge in patterns consistent with the reduction of interest group competition. Third, I present the results of statistical models that provide further evidence that the repeal of Glass-Steagall represents a turning point with respect to intra-industry competition. I show that after 1999 competing interest groups began to coordinate their contributions to members of committees with jurisdiction over financial services legislation; before the repeal of Glass-Steagall, there is no evidence of this. Taken together, these three approaches suggest that the regulatory environment shapes not only the business practices of corporations, but also the ways they attempt to influence public policy.",

    "abstract": "The thesis is motivated by two major trends: the rise of a global information and knowledge economy, and environmental degradation and the search for sustainable solutions. The increasing importance of knowledge has by some been equated with a new industrial revolution, one based on computer technology, digital infrastructure, and highly educated and technically skilled workers. But how do we assess the value of knowledge in this 'new' economy? The question over value is explored through the diffusion and localization of new knowledge via a knowledge network, based on information technology. The central argument is that in the knowledge economy, the value of knowledge lies in the ability to share it over a knowledge network, which allows for diffusion and localization of new knowledge. This central thesis and the value of knowledge networks is further explored by looking at the case of environmentally friendly or sustainable production. The knowledge network targets barriers to environmentally friendly practices by encouraging and enabling diffusion of knowledge related to sustainable products and processes. The knowledge scope for environmental solutions is analyzed, with the objective to develop common categories, and to understand better the increasing complexities and knowledge needs as enterprises engage in sustainable production. In discussing the knowledge economy and knowledge networks, the thesis focuses mostly on the business enterprise. But the development of the knowledge age has much larger implications, such as 'knowledge for whom?' and 'value for whom?'. The information technologies and networks offer new ways for people and groups to interact and influence social issues and can enable the diffusion of wide variety of views and perspectives. Thinking about the information and knowledge age in the larger economic and social context requires us to consider who builds, controls, influences and benefits from the technology and its use. Before we can reasonably approach this analysis, a basic conceptual framework or understanding of knowledge sharing, knowledge networks, and value of knowledge is called for. This thesis is a building block for such a framework, a contribution to future research into the economic and social implications of the knowledge economy.",

    "abstract": "The meltdown of Fukushima Daiichi's nuclear plant was one of three disasters that rocked Japan on 11 March 2011, a day often referred to as \"3.11.\" This nuclear accident led to increased attention to and disapproval of nuclear power among the Japanese public. However, despite widespread antinuclear sentiment, the public did not mobilize into sustained mass protests until June 2012. Using historical and contemporary comparisons, this thesis shows that Japan's 15- month delay in antinuclear mobilization was unusual. Both the 1979 Three Mile Island and the 1986 Chernobyl accidents had been quickly followed by mobilized protests. Moreover, the 3.11 Fukushima meltdown prompted mass protests in Germany almost immediately. Given these patterns, one would expect to have seen the Japanese mobilize earlier. The question that drives this thesis is: What led to Japan's 15-month delay in antinuclear power mobilization? Using social movement theory, I test to see whether low levels of grievance, limited availability of resources, or the lack of effective mobilizing structure and strategy help to explain this delay. Of the three explanations, I find the mobilization structure and strategy explanation to be best supported. Due to a history of overlooking antinuclear power issues in Japanese civil society, the early post-3.11 movement lacked longstanding true believers and activists, the two types of participants most effective at mobilizing. Furthermore, the use of social media platforms to organize the early protests may have contributed to why sustained protests were delayed. The empirical findings from this thesis allow us to examine more closely the devastation resulting from 3.11's nuclear meltdown and assess the strengths and weaknesses in Japanese civil society after the disaster. On a theoretical level, these findings may encourage us to question the relevance of grievance to mobilization, refine how resource availability is measured, and ask if the growing use of social media and other online tools should change the way we study social movement mobilization.",

By dictating the terms of the discussion, conservatives lessened the impact of liberal narratives and saw gains in state legislation and public opinion as a result."

    "abstract": "Japan's labor markets are clearly segmented between regular and irregular workers. Regular workers enjoy employment stability, good wages and promotion, and access to good pensions and health plans. Irregular workers-contract, dispatch and part time workers-can be fired easily, are paid less, and don't have access to fringe benefits. In Japan irregular work contracts have been progressively liberalized since the 1980s, and the share of irregular employment over the same time period has more than doubled to over one third of all workers. However, there are important cases of re-regulation. How can we account for Japan's specific policy path in regard to irregular work contracts? A good explanation ought to shed light on the politics of similar labor market phenomena across the affluent democracies. In this project I argue the policy process by which labor policies are decided substantially impacts whether or not irregular work contracts are liberalized or re-regulated. When labor unions and employer associations bargain over policy in consensus-based deliberative councils housed in the labor ministry the resultant policies are very unlikely to be favorable to irregular workers, though they are likely to be favorable to regular workers. This is the way most policies were decided until the 1990s. In contrast, when labor policies are processed through parliamentary politics the content of policy is shaped by electoral competition between the parties of the right and left. Irregular work contracts receive favorable policies only when there is an electorally credible party of the left. When there is not a credible leftist party both regular and irregular work contracts are liberalized. Political competition rather than formal inclusion of labor representatives most often results in favorable policies for irregular workers.",

Five in-depth case studies (Hongkong, Tokyo-Narita, London- Heathrow, Chicago- O'Hare and Paris-Charles de Gaulle) and eight smaller case studies (Kuala Lumpur, Seoul, Shanghai-Pudong, Bangkok, Beijing, Rome- Fiumicino, Istanbul-Atatirk and Munich- Franz Josef Strauss) are conducted. The thesis builds on existing literature that compares airport-rail links by explicitly considering the influence of the institutional environment of an airport on its ground access situation and by paying special attention to recently opened dedicated airport expresses in Asia. It is found that sustained government support and a sense of urgency for better airport access are the main motivating forces that need to be present if a dedicated airport express is to be constructed. For these reasons a number of dedicated airport express systems were constructed in Asia (Hong Kong, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur, Seoul, Shanghai, Bangkok), where they were conceived simultaneously with the airports they serve. In cases with less focused objectives (Chicago, Paris, Chicago) lengthy planning periods have not yet led to the construction of an airport-rail link. London was the first airport-rail link in the Western world and exhibited strong government support for rail investments during a period of generally favorable conditions, which jointly led to the construction of the Heathrow Express. Five of eight dedicated systems that are studied exhibit underestimation of ridership and underestimation of delivery time. The finding replicates for Asian examples (Hong Kong, Seoul, Bangkok, Shanghai) Flyvbjerg's (2009) observations on UK and US examples that transportation projects tend to systematically overestimate project benefits. The enduring and systematic overestimates of ridership hint at deliberate strategic misrepresentation rather than psychological optimism bias or technical error as reason for the erroneous estimates. Planners are advised to be aware of incentives for strategic misrepresentation among public and private agencies that prepare technical studies as basis for decision making. In a number of systems that have dedicated rail service to an airport and are generally considered successful, fierce competition from buses has emerged recently (Hong Kong, Tokyo, London). It is recommended to planners of airport-rail links today to consider realization through bus rapid transit on dedicated rights-of-way in addition to airport-rail links because of their lower cost, wider scope in dropoff and pick-up destinations and easier scalability of capacity in times of low demand.",

A firm may extract benefits through the payment of bribes to foreign public officials without its own country bearing the associated costs of governmental corruption, and hence while eliminating foreign bribery may be in the best interests of all who are engaged with the global economy, there are few obvious incentives for any one national government to be the first to take action. Over the last two decades, however, an unprecedented degree of multilateral cooperation on the issue of foreign bribery has been achieved. In particular, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has been a key institutional locus of activity, serving as the coordinating body for the monitoring and enforcement of a comprehensive anti-bribery convention that was adopted in 1997. This convention appears to have been largely successful at least in terms of spurring legislative change: all OECD member countries as well as several nonmember nations have since adopted laws that explicitly criminalize the act of bribing foreign public officials, and the capacity of the state to monitor, detect, and prosecute the offense of foreign bribery has ostensibly been enhanced. Given the potential for collective action problems to develop, it is thus important to ask whether the legislative action that has been taken thus far is meaningful in any measurable sense. I answer this question by constructing an original measure of the strictness of foreign bribery legislation, which I then employ as the main independent variable in an empirical study of export data, utilizing both difference-in-difference estimators and regression analysis. The results of my analysis provide support for the hypothesis that the enactment of stricter foreign bribery legislation amongst the countries party to the OECD convention has reduced exports to more corrupt countries more so than it has exports to less corrupt countries. These findings are robust to a variety of sensitivity tests, and I thus conclude that the OECD's multilateral anti-bribery initiatives have indeed had a meaningful impact on business decisions in the international economy.",

Both historians and political scientists assume lynching to be the method through which the white population of the American South prevented political and social equality. Lynching is a form of ethnic violence, but there has not yet been a rigorous methodological examination of it as a potential form of political violence. In the following thesis I will examine the claims regarding the use of political violence within lynching in the southern United States. Under what circumstances would political violence be used or not be used in equilibrium? I begin with the assumption that lynching increases due to an impending election. Violence would be a function of the temporal proximity of a certain election. I will examine this claim using the dates of lynching and elections from 1880 to 1890. The second analysis of the paper examines whether or not political violence is due to factional politics. Violence would then be a function of the margin of the Republican or Democrat victory. The temptation to engage in political violence to manipulate election outcomes increases as the election draws closer. In this analysis, we examine the violence leading up to the election date with controls, including fixed effects (by state and county), census data and clustered standard error.",

    "abstract": "Ethnic civil wars are the most abundant form of large-scale, deadly conflict in the world today, yet the dedicated study of ethnic civil war is relatively new within political science. One empirical observation repeated in the literature is that civil wars are less likely than interstate wars to end in negotiated settlements, and more likely to end in military victory for one side. Recently, scholars have employed expected utility theory and the security dilemma to construct models of how ethnic combatants choose between settling their differences at the bargaining table or on the battlefield. Rooted in the rational choice paradigm, these models draw upon utility calculations and security concerns to describe ethnic combatants' decision processes and explain the low rate of ethnic war settlement. Two problems with these rational choice models, however, are that they cannot account for cases of ethnic war in which combatants elect to continue fighting losing battles when a normatively \"rational\" settlement is available, and that they do not seem to accurately describe the decision-making behavior of ethnic combatants. In this thesis, I draw upon the principles of prospect theory, a descriptive theory of choice under conditions of risk and uncertainty, to construct a psychological model of ethnic war termination. I argue that ethnic combatants do not behave as rational choice theories suggest; rather, they choose to settle or fight by framing the possible outcomes as gains or losses relative to a subjective reference point. I analyze my theory by comparing it to three prominent rational choice models: Mason and Fett's expected utility theory, Walter's credible commitment theory, and Kaufmann's demographic separation theory. I then perform a first-brush test of my theory by applying all four models to two case studies, the Ethiopian-Eritrean War and the Bosnian Civil War, to determine which model best explains the behavior of the combatants.",

    "abstract": "Excessive sodium consumption is both prevalent and very costly in many countries around the world. Recent research has found that more than 90% of the world's adult population live in countries with mean intakes exceeding the World Health Organization's recommendation, and that more than a million deaths every year may be attributable to excess sodium. This study uses a simulation model to estimate, for the first time, the cost-effectiveness of government interventions to reduce population sodium consumption in every country in the world. It reveals substantial heterogeneity in cost-effectiveness by country that has never before been identified, and illustrates, also for the first time, the sensitivity of intervention efficacy to the theoretical-minimum-risk exposure distribution of sodium intake. The study makes a number of additional contributions. It offers a comprehensive appraisal of the methodological strengths and limitations of the surveys, imputation models, randomized controlled trials, prospective cohort studies, meta-analyses, and simulation models that together constitute the evidence base for public health recommendations on sodium intake, as well as for this study's own analysis. These methodological issues, some raised for the first time, are evaluated systematically to allow the relative quality of each input to be assessed and to inform prioritization of further research. The study also uses economic theory to ground a discussion of the proper nature and scope of government policies targeting population sodium consumption, and presents an up-to-date survey of sodium reduction initiatives around the world.",

Using analysis of satellite imagery, recent military exercises, and a series of source interviews, I examine the evolution of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. In particular I explore the effect of religious radicalism on Iran's acceptable casualty rates for its naval operations. A successful ideologically based strategy appears to have three necessary components: terrorism as a tool for pursuing political objectives, religious ideology as a generator of potential violence, and a regime which exercises tight control over the military. Combined, these factors allow a military to mobilize a large cadre of troops that are willing to sacrifice themselves in suicide operations. Ideology overcomes conventional acceptable casualty rates for sustained military sorties. Finally, I compare the Iranian case to similar militaries in the Sudan and Yugoslavia to determine how the presence and absence of each factor affects the military's development.",

However, political antagonism driven by nationalistic sentiments continues to break out in countries with increased inflows of foreign investments, such as China. The media identifies that a majority of participants in China's recent anti-foreign antagonism are urban young Chinese and nicknames them China's \"angry youths\". This thesis focuses on the micro-foundations underlying expressions of nationalism in the forms of economic protectionism and xenophobic political hostility, and musters both public and original survey data to examine the dynamic effects of interpersonal contact and patriotic predisposition as explanations for individual attitudes on international policy issues. The empirical analyses of three main hypotheses suggest that the Chinese generation of \"angry youth\" is not as radical as the media has portrayed. Yet, their significantly higher levels of comfort with western values and rules of the game in the era of globalization do not necessarily mean that they are any more eager to embrace the global and transnational socioeconomic and sociopolitical identities than their seniors. This thesis finds that China's integration into the global economy over the past three decades has not yet promoted more popular cosmopolitan identities and perspectives among the general public as various theoretical accounts project, even among citizens who have high levels of exposure to foreign business and economic influence. The persistence of nationalistic worldviews and identities among the Chinese public has serious implications for foreign businesses and governments that wish to proactively engage a rising China in international and regional affairs.",

A normative framework, based on the major theories of representation, is used to examine the empirical mechanisms through which the poor can obtain representation. \"Formal\" mechanisms include voting, formal participatory activities and membership in political institutions. The primary \"informal\" mechanism examined is the public opinion survey. The normative framework is grounded in the notion that being poor in an affluent nation is an attached, personal interest--a substantive understanding of the interests of the poor cannot be determined through intellectual deliberation alone. Social and economic closeness (or similarity in relevant descriptive characteristics such as income and race) informs poverty advocates about the nature of poverty and the impact of anti-poverty policies. A significant amount of evidence suggests that the poor are underrepresented (relative to other groups with more economic and political resources) in formal participation mechanisms. There is less evidence about how well and to what extent the poor are represented in the primary \"informal mechanism\"--public opinion.

    "abstract": "While undoubtedly the most powerful nation in the world, the U.S. is constrained in its ability to further its national interests by the attitudes and actions of foreign governments and, more importantly, foreign publics. The growing ability of individuals and small groups to threaten the security and vital interests of the United States necessitates improved cooperation and empathy on the part of foreign publics as well as their governments. Moreover, the concurrent decline in the utility of military statecraft due to both higher costs and decreasing international legitimacy means that policymakers are forced to consider alternative means of influencing the behavior of others. Public diplomacy is a critically important example of such an alternative means. Unfortunately, understanding public diplomacy and its effects is hampered by a lack of conceptual tools used to develop and evaluate various strategies of public diplomacy. Consequently, the following paper seeks to combine existing theoretical arguments regarding strategic communication and mass persuasion to develop an analytical model that can be used to critique the United States' current public diplomacy strategy. According to the model developed and tested herein, strategic directionality and the level of elite orientation are the two primary causal factors that determine the outcome of a particular public diplomacy campaign. Target audience predisposition and the degree to which the campaign itself is concealed from the audience serve as two intervening variables that may retard the progress of a campaign. Thus, the diagrammatical structure of the model is as follows: Directional Message + Elite-Oriented Message --> Successful PD Campaign Intervening Variables: Predisposition Concealment of Campaign. When tested against Britain's efforts to recruit the U.S. as an ally prior to the end of 1941 and Kuwait's efforts to retain the support of the U.S. after Iraq's invasion in August 1990, the model is found to be sound. The model predicts that the current U.S. public diplomacy campaign in the Middle East will fail due to a lack of strategic directionality, limited elite orientation, and poor concealment of the campaign itself. By way of conclusion, several policy prescriptions are offered to improve the levels of each of these variables.",

    "abstract": "The 20th century witnessed the steady decline of the ability of states, particularly great powers, to defeat insurgencies. During the same period, the world has become both more populous and more urban. As people have taken to the cities, so too have insurgents increasingly made battlefields out of urban areas. This study has sought to determine the impact of urbanization on insurgency outcomes using a post-war dataset of insurgencies. It has predicted that urbanized insurgencies favor the insurgent by facilitating concealment and cover, nullifying the relatively power differential enjoyed by states, and providing them with an abundance of soft targets useful for undermining the counterinsurgent's legitimacy. Although constrained by a number of data limitations, the results demonstrated that more urbanized insurgencies were a significant challenge to counter insurgents. By partitioning the dataset by insurgency type, the study was able to determine unique predictors of conflict outcome for each type. Urbanized insurgencies are particularly hard to defeat when the counterinsurgent is a foreign occupier, more democratic, and the insurgency has external support. Rural insurgencies become more difficult to defeat the more linguistically diverse the population. Furthermore, by increasing the number of conflict casualties, rural insurgents can particularly benefit from rough terrain.",

Due to the cross-boundary nature of these activities, international cooperation is particularly critical for eradicating these threats. This thesis analyzes a particular instance of a non-state threat, maritime piracy, and uses it as a probe for understanding the nature of international cooperation vis-a-vis non-state actors. I observe a somewhat surprising trend while collating a database of all instances of international cooperation against maritime piracy throughout the world - Asia, and in particular Southeast Asia, has been the source of a disproportionately high level of international cooperation that is focused on eradicating the piracy problem. Furthermore, this trend has occurred even though Asia is often regarded as lacking the conditions necessary for international cooperation in the traditional security domain - binding multilateral institutions that can facilitate the institutionalization of cooperation agreements, as well as a hegemonic power with the ability to enforce cooperation. What has enabled international cooperation against maritime piracy to flourish in Asia, and what does this imply about non-traditional forms of security cooperation? I propose that non-traditional security cooperation has thrived in Asia for at least two unconventional reasons - the ability of non-binding institutions such as ASEAN to facilitate and promote non-traditional security cooperation, as well as the effective use of national coast guard agencies to avoid the political sensitivities that often result from security cooperation in the traditional domain.",

What is equally puzzling is the contrast in the share of women in positions of political authority observed between countries, with many developed nations having fewer women legislators than a number of lesser-developed countries. Why are there so few women in most parliaments and why is there such variation across countries? To understand gender-based inequality in political authority, we look at the various stages of candidacy and identify potential bottlenecks to women participation and election into public office. There are three stages which one must pass through successfully to become a legislator. The first is becoming eligible and a part of the pool from which politicians are drawn, then being selected as a candidate and finally being elected to office. Potential barriers to entry for women in the legislative process may exist at any or all of these three stages. Each of these candidacy stages is discussed through a cross-national analysis and a case study of India. The cross-national data is for 175 countries at three points in time: 1975, 1985 and 1995. The Indian case study looks at women in parliament from the first general elections in 1951-1952 and focuses most on the 1996 parliamentary data.

This dissertation analyzes how the Chilean military regime (1973-90) organized coercion, focusing especially on two major shifts during the period of most institutional flux, from 1973-78. Available explanations for the shifts fail to account for the magnitude of organizational changes. As an alternative, this dissertation provides a typology of coercion, based on measurements of how well principals monitor agents' operations and performance. Principals can monitor from within their own organization (internal monitoring), or from information sources outside their direct control (external monitoring). Measuring levels of internal and external monitoring, using various criteria for the breadth and depth of information, yields a matrix with types that are mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive. The four basic types are blind, bureaucratic, transparent, and hide and seek coercion. There are tradeoffs to each type of coercion, which can prompt principals to shift from one to another. In Chile, measurements of internal and external monitoring before and after each of the two major shifts, alongside counterfactual analysis and tests of the competing available explanations, reveal that the regime in each case grappled with organizing coercion as a discrete problem of governance. In 1974 the regime created a powerful secret police to better coordinate coercion through higher internal monitoring.

Second, why do some people support welfare policies more than others? This collection of essays aims to answer these two questions, focusing on the political and economic determinants of welfare policy and attitudes. Chapter 2 deals with methodological issues that will be addressed in the later substantive chapters. While this chapter discusses measurement error in general, it focuses on the problem that some respondents are likely to choose around the middle for reasons other than their true moderate attitudes in many survey items. The chapter formally analyzes the effects of this \"concentrated measurement error\" on the bias in regression coefficient estimates. It then proposes two estimation strategies for the handling of this problem. Turning to substantive research questions, Chapter 3 addresses the determinants of government welfare spending around the world. With the use of a unique dataset that has been constructed from six different cross-country social surveys and government finance statistics, this chapter demonstrates that public ideological preferences influence government decisions regarding the size of welfare expenditure. The chapter further presents a meaningful difference between fully and less democratic countries in welfare policy responsiveness; among less democratic countries, welfare spending policies have been little affected by public preferences. The empirical findings presented in this chapter serve as better evidence to support the mechanisms that traditional representation theories offer. In Chapter 4, I turn my attention to individual-level determinants. Recognizing the unique situation of the US, where the immigrant population is large and the natives have a distinctively individualistic taste for redistribution, this chapter assesses the role of socialization and assimilation by examining the political preferences of first-, second-, and third-generation immigrants with regard to welfare spending. It provides empirical evidence that first-generation immigrants show greater support for welfare than US-born natives; however, it also shows that the political views of immigrants more closely resemble those of US-born natives the longer that the immigrants stay in the US, thereby suggesting their assimilation into US society.

    "abstract": "In dominant-party states, why do individuals vote in elections with foregone conclusions when they are neither bought nor coerced? It is especially curious in these cases why the rural poor decide to cast their ballots. I posit that communities that collectively rely on the government for public services foster social norms of voting to influence turnout. Motivated by the perception that regimes reward high turnout areas with public goods, communities use esteem \"carrots\" and social \"sticks\" to overcome free-rider incentives and increase the likelihood of receiving services. The norm is strongest in less politically-competitive areas, precisely where the puzzle of participation is most obvious. At the individual level, those who rely on their local community for non-material goods, such as information and kinship, are more likely to comply with the norm in order to secure their access to these social benefits. Findings from a lab-in-the-field voting experiment in rural Tanzania indicate a strong influence of the social norm of voting. In the experiment, when turnout is public to their neighbors, respondents are 11 percentage points more likely to vote, compared to when they are in private. The theory, which applies broadly to many patronage-based regimes, explains how communities sustain social norms of voting even when elections lack legitimacy, elucidating the paradox of high turnout in dominant-party systems.",

I posit that communities that collectively rely on the government for public services foster social norms of voting to influence turnout. Motivated by the perception that regimes reward high turnout areas with public goods, communities use esteem \"carrots\" and social \"sticks\" to overcome free-rider incentives and increase the likelihood of receiving services. The norm is strongest in less politically-competitive areas, precisely where the puzzle of participation is most obvious. At the individual level, those who rely on their local community for non-material goods, such as information and kinship, are more likely to comply with the norm in order to secure their access to these social benefits. Findings from a lab-in-the-field voting experiment in rural Tanzania indicate a strong influence of the social norm of voting. In the experiment, when turnout is public to their neighbors, respondents are 11 percentage points more likely to vote, compared to when they are in private. The theory, which applies broadly to many patronage-based regimes, explains how communities sustain social norms of voting even when elections lack legitimacy, elucidating the paradox of high turnout in dominant-party systems."

    "abstract": "This thesis examines technological innovation capabilities in the Chinese machine tool, automobile, telecommunications equipment, and information technology sectors in the era of reform ( 1979-2002). Contrary to other studies, the thesis reveals that the foundations for Chinese industrial learning and innovation are weak. I evaluate several models for explaining why this is true, including market-, developmental state-, and regional-based explanations. Finding these unsatisfactory, I propose an alternative model: particularist political structure and industrial strategic culture undermine the ability of Chinese firms to associate, learn, and innovate. Particularism and strategic culture interact to undermine reciprocity and trust, weakening the ability of Chinese industrial firms to form effective horizontal association. As observed in economies from the developed (e.g. United States) to the developing (e.g. Taiwan), horizontal association between manufacturers as well as customers, suppliers, financers, research institutes, and universities is critical to industrial learning and technology development. The weakness of associational means for reducing risk and promoting information and resource flows inhibits the ability of Chinese firms to effectively indigenize, diffuse, innovate, and leverage industrial technology. Political particularism - manipulation of state policy and resources by agents of the state in pursuit of parochial goals - intensified during the reform period.

    "abstract": "Year after year, Americans are told that their country's reputation is on the line. If we do not carry out our commitments, our foreign policy leaders warn, no one will believe our threats and promises in the future. This claim rests on the hypothesis, which I call the \"reputation hypothesis,\" that tomorrow's enemies will assess America's credibility on the basis of U.S. actions today. Is the reputation hypothesis true? Will our adversaries predict our future actions by looking at today's decisions? More generally, do decision makers predict their adversaries' actions in a crisis by looking at the adversaries' previous actions? I test the reputation hypothesis against a hypothesis which I call the \"power/interests\" hypothesis. This hypothesis posits that decision makers assess the credibility of an adversary's threats by assessing the current balance of power and interests; commitments are credible when they support important interests and are backed up by the power to carry them out. I test these theories by studying American and British decision making during three crises. From 1958-1962, the Soviet Union and the NATO allies faced each other in a series of crises over Berlin and Cuba. I use evidence from American and British archives to discover how decision makers assessed Soviet credibility during these crises. I look for evidence that they based their assessments of Soviet credibility on past Soviet actions, and for evidence that they assessed Soviet credibility by evaluating the current balance of power and interests. The results are striking: during this period the Soviets repeatedly made threats and then backed down. But years of unfulfilled threats did not damage Soviet credibility. In fact, Soviet credibility grew from 1958-62, as the power/interests hypothesis predicts. American and British decision makers worried constantly about their own reputation, but they did not use Soviet past behavior to assess Soviet credibility. This research suggests that countries should not fight to build a reputation for credibility - threats will be credible if and only if they promote substantial interests and are backed up by sufficient power.",

    "abstract": "Do a dominant state's policies have a greater effect on a rising state's threat perceptions or its assessment of the dominant state's resolve? Existing theory, rooted in Jervis's spiral and deterrence models, contends that the answer depends on whether the state has status quo or revisionist intentions. Rising states are typically seen as revisionist, a type of state that is said to be easily emboldened by conciliation but not easily threatened by competition. This project, on the other hand, argues that rising states - even those with revisionist aims - are more easily threatened than emboldened. Anarchy and uncertainty surrounding the dominant state's intentions give all rising states incentive to be cautious in their assessments. Underestimating threats could leave a rising state more vulnerable to coercion or unprepared for war with a materially stronger dominant state. Rising states, therefore, increase their threat assessments in response to almost any kind of competition by the dominant state. The risks of underestimating the dominant state's resolve are also significant: a resolute dominant state might respond to a challenge with overwhelming force. Therefore, rising states only downgrade their assessments of the dominant state's resolve in the face of very strong signals, such as large, militarily useful concessions. This dissertation tests these competing arguments during periods when Britain was a dominant state facing a rising, revisionist power - the United States (1837-1846) and Wilhelmine Germany (1894-1898). Detailed, historical analysis identified each British policy change and assessed the impact on U.S. and German perceptions. The results suggest that existing theory overstates the risks of conciliating rising states and understates the impact that competition has on a rising state's threat perceptions.

    "abstract": "When is non-state violence politically effective? Existing scholarship suggests that insurgency and terrorism are generally effective or ineffective based on the analysis of unitary non-state coercers operating solely at the strategic level. Although this approach provides useful insight, a failure to account for the internal dynamics of social movements within which armed groups are embedded obscures many of the most important causes and effects of non-state violence. The structuralist theory of non-state violence holds that the structure of power within social movements explains the greatest variation in both the use of violence by armed groups and its political effectiveness. Armed groups pursue common strategic goals that are characterized by collective action challenges against external enemies, such as the founding of a new state, while they simultaneously engage in zero-sum competition for organizational dominance with internal rivals. The central hypothesis of the structuralist theory is that violence is more likely to be strategically effective when employed by a unipolar social movement with one dominant armed group than by a multipolar social movement with two or more significant armed groups. The secondary hypothesis is that the strongest armed group in a social movement is the most likely to pursue strategic goals, whereas weaker groups in the hierarchy are more likely to pursue organizational goals exclusively, to the detriment of the movement. This theory is tested with a longitudinal analysis of 29 groups in 33 campaigns marked by a mix of violent and nonviolent action within the Palestinian, Irish, Zionist, and Algerian national movements. Analysis of primary sources and extensive interviews with key participants and observers help to demonstrate that the hierarchical position of groups within each of the four movements drove their relative focus towards strategic or organizational objectives as well as their associated use or non-use of violence. Furthermore, violence was more politically effective during periods of unipolarity than during periods of multipolarity within each movement. The structuralist theory of non-state violence thus reveals and explains greater variation in the political effectiveness of non-state violence than previous scholarship.",

    "abstract": "The dissertation is a comparative study of three multilateral development banks (MDBs)-the World Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and European Investment Bank (EIB)-and their struggles to operationalize and implement relatively new environmental mandates. MDBs are increasingly being relied upon to address environmental issues in their activities, while at the same time facing criticism for allegedly promoting serious environmental degradation in borrowing countries. The dissertation focuses on the activities of these banks in Central and Eastern Europe, where the fall of the Iron Curtain revealed the most polluted countries in Europe, and where these MDBs are among the top donors. There is significant variation in the degree to which these MDBs have incorporated environmental goals into their work. The World Bank has played an important role in providing policy support for environmental reform in the region, while financing the largest scope of \"green\" projects of the three banks. The EIB has responded to its environmental goals in minimal ways, and the EBRD has an intermediate position between the other two. I argue that external pressure from major shareholder countries, usually supported or pushed by NGOs, is a key factor determining the depth of an MDB's commitment to new mandates, such as the environment. However, shareholder commitment is a necessary but not sufficient condition in explaining the banks' environmental behavior. Governance structures for all three banks are diffuse, and, as a result, institutional design and incentive systems play critical roles in how environmental objectives are translated into activities. In all three cases, the banks' internal incentive systems are poorly aligned with their environmental goals, and even where institutional variables are structured to promote greater awareness of environmental issues within the banks, they do not always work as envisioned. Theoretically, the dissertation argues that different causal variables matter at different stages of the policy process. Neorealist approaches have the most explanatory power in accounting for how environmental ideas are brought to the MDBs, but are insufficient in explaining outcomes. Approaches drawn from institutionalist and organizational theories, in turn, provide guidance in analyzing the mechanisms by which environmental objectives are translated into practice.

This dissertation asks: when and why does the salience of ethnic and class categories vary across elections in emerging democracies? It argues that which categories are politicized has less to do with which categories are most salient to voters and more to do with which are most useful to politicians. The strategies of politicians, however, are contrained in a particular ways, by opportunity, which is provided by party system crises, and by the political space, which is given by the structure of existing social identity categories, particularly their sizes and degrees of overlap with traditionally-politicized categories. Given the institutional rules, size and overlap affect which identity groups have the numbers to win and which describe similar constituencies that could be switched between for political expediency. The project nests the theory within an explanatory framework describing four key factors that drive variation in identification: voter preferences, political institutions, party institutions, and elite manipulation.

    "abstract": "The objective of this dissertation is to systematize the existing hypotheses in the electoral engineering literature and to test them in a set of selected case studies in order to answer a central question: does the electoral system affect the structure of political parties in ethnically divided societies and if so how? The academic debate on electoral design for divided societies has focused on the impact of institutional choices on ultimate conflict outcomes. The findings of previous studies have been generally inconclusive, while the lack of sub-national data on ethnic composition and voting patterns has made it difficult to examine mechanisms regarding the role of demographics. To approach the problem from a different angle, I propose a research design focusing on the intermediate link from electoral institutions to the ethnic structure of the party system. For the empirical portion of my work, I chose to conduct a structured historical comparison of four societies which implemented major electoral reforms: Turkey, Northern Ireland, Guyana, and Sri Lanka. Based on the study of these cases, I am arguing that politicians and voters have not responded to electoral incentives in the ways predicted by existent theories, and that no clear relationship can be observed between the electoral system's proportionality, the heterogeneity of electoral constituencies, and the number of parties or the types of ethnic appeals they make to voters. These findings indicate that the hopes placed in electoral system design for divided societies are unwarranted and that attention among political scientists and policymakers should shift to other peace-building approaches.",

The academic debate on electoral design for divided societies has focused on the impact of institutional choices on ultimate conflict outcomes. The findings of previous studies have been generally inconclusive, while the lack of sub-national data on ethnic composition and voting patterns has made it difficult to examine mechanisms regarding the role of demographics. To approach the problem from a different angle, I propose a research design focusing on the intermediate link from electoral institutions to the ethnic structure of the party system. For the empirical portion of my work, I chose to conduct a structured historical comparison of four societies which implemented major electoral reforms: Turkey, Northern Ireland, Guyana, and Sri Lanka. Based on the study of these cases, I am arguing that politicians and voters have not responded to electoral incentives in the ways predicted by existent theories, and that no clear relationship can be observed between the electoral system's proportionality, the heterogeneity of electoral constituencies, and the number of parties or the types of ethnic appeals they make to voters. These findings indicate that the hopes placed in electoral system design for divided societies are unwarranted and that attention among political scientists and policymakers should shift to other peace-building approaches."

    "abstract": "This dissertation presents a new type of theory about the impact of increased transnational capital flows on state building processes. Most of the political science literature about globalization has been focused on debating the question of deterritorialization where the powers of territorial nation-states are viewed as being eroded by the increased transnational mobility of capital. This dissertation, in contrast, demonstrates how international tourism development-like many other aspects of globalization--can also produce \"reterritorialization\" characterized by the increased relevance of \"place\" for global economic activity. With increased globalization firms often seek to locate themselves in specific territories in order to capture what I call locational rents and external economies. In contrast to the dislocating effects of deterritorialization, reterritorialization can increase the political influence of state, societal, and transnational agents able to create localities that generate locational rents and external economies. The dissertation explores how states in the Middle East have promoted reterritorialization through tourism development in an attempt to enhance their control over capital and cultural flows as they promote economic liberalization and the incorporation of their economies into global markets. My fieldwork explored two national case studies with different configurations of territorial control. In Tunisia, I found that centralized state control over the territorially defined resources and institutions driving the reterritorialization process allowed the state to extend its control over transnational capital flows, the local private sector,",

    "abstract": "This dissertation examines how the National Organization for Women (NOW) survived the vagaries of both the political environment and its intraorganizational problems and controversies over its thirty-five year history. It considers the role that patrons, the state, mobilizing structures, leaders, organizational structure, strategic flexibility, and collective identity played in NOW's creation and maintenance. Little support is found for the role of patrons or of the state in NOW's origination and sustenance. Mobilizing structures, in the form of social networks, however, proved crucial factors supporting NOW between 1966 and 1971, its founding period. NOW's organizational structure, particularly its (limited) professionalization and its federalization both assisted NOW in overcoming potentially crippling information gaps between members and leaders. However, federalization has not had an entirely benign effect. In addition to allowing a great deal of autonomy, NOW's federal structure also permitted the development of strong intraorganizational factions. Leaders positively influenced organizational stability by enhancing NOW's collective identity and by stewarding the group towards new strategies. However, NOW's strong identity acts as a constraint upon leaders' ability to change the organization's goals or tactical approach. NOW's longevity and institutionalization over time suggests a second set of issues which are examined in this study. How has NOW's aging affected the organization's attention to its founding principles?",

In three essays that leverage natural experimental research designs, I advance new explanations for individual turnout, focused on citizens' access to, and experiences with the core electoral institutions of democracy. In paper 1 I show that policies focused on increasing access to elections can increase the size of the electorate, but also that they may carry compositional costs. Using new administrative data from South Africa and a difference-in-differences design, I show that the Independent Electoral Commission's large scale expansion of access to voting stations has increased national turnout by between 2.3 and 4.7 percentage points over the period 1999 to 2014. I then demonstrate, in the context of an administrative quasi-experiment, that those of high socio-economic status and those who are older are much more sensitive to electoral access than others. In paper 2 I explore whether differential representation in government shapes political behavior. I leverage the fact that the size of local government councils in South Africa follows a population-based formula with cutoffs that alter the degree of local representation. The results from a regression kink design suggest that at the margin the degree of representation is not particularly important for informing voters' decision to vote. Finally, paper 3 considers the effect of voting in South Africa's first democratic election in 1994 on future voting, and present evidence of the lasting behavioral effects of past participation using a regression discontinuity design. Eligibility to participate in 1994 affects future voting by 3 percentage points, with an average treatment effect of actually voting between 3.5 and 8.5 percentage points. I argue that persistence (or habituation) in voting behavior is at least partly driven by the creation of associations between first time voting and positive emotional states.

    "abstract": "In the 1960s, the UK had some of the most generous welfare provision in the world, assisting people 'from the cradle to the grave', in the words of its designer William Beveridge. Widely supported by voters and politicians of all stripes, it remained largely intact into the early 1980s. Yet since then, the benefits system has been radically transformed into one of the developed world's least generous, with major implications for poverty and social cohesion. Public opinion has also turned against it to a degree that is unmatched anywhere else. Until recently, both major parties largely embraced the new settlement, using increasingly harsh rhetoric to describe welfare - and its users. Looking at welfare programs that provide relief from unemployment, poverty, and disability, I ask why this transformation occurred. I offer an explicitly political and top-down explanation, focusing on the role of party competition and a large change in the composition of the UK's Labour party, which originally set up the welfare state. As it increasingly recruited legislators from outside of the working-class, both its stance and rhetoric on welfare reform shifted dramatically. I show that this rhetoric ultimately turned the British public into welfare skeptics who are willing to endorse far-reaching retrenchment. Hence this case study offers a cautionary tale of how the political coalitions underpinning social policy can quickly unravel. Political and popular support for welfare provision is by no means guaranteed, even in an era of rising insecurity and inequality, particularly as social democratic parties become increasingly unrecognizable compared to their working-class roots, and welfare is subjected to means-testing, drawing lines between recipients and taxpayers. This thesis includes six chapters, and uses a database I have assembled of every speech made about welfare issues in the British Parliament from 1987-2015, together with a wealth of public opinion data.

    "abstract": "This dissertation asks: what explains variation in how other great powers respond to rising powers? It tries to explain why the emergence of a rising power sometimes leads to tension, rivalry, and war, and other times leads to less competitive responses. This project analyzes the effect of the rising power's grand strategy-whether it is reassurance or coercion--on the severity of the balancing response by the other major powers. I develop a theory of successful reassurance that shows how a rising power can prevent or minimize the severity of the balancing response by other great powers. Reassurance can limit the balancing response through two causal mechanisms: 1) reduced estimates that rising power is a threat; and 2) reaping the benefits from a rising power. I also develop a theory of coercion backfire that shows how a rising power that implements a grand strategy of coercion is more likely to make others feel especially threatened, and therefore more likely to provoke an early and especially firm response, exacerbating the severity of the balancing response. I apply this theory to explain the balancing responses to the rise of Germany from 1871 to 1907 and the rise of China in the post-Cold War world. The empirical tests and process tracing evidence demonstrate that rising powers, contrary to the expectations of most realist balance of power and rationalist accounts, have considerable agency to affect the balancing response. In the cases of the rising powers of contemporary China and Bismarckian Germany, grand strategies of reassurance convinced states to minimize the severity of their balancing responses, even as the rising power's material power continued to grow. In contrast, Wilhelmine Germany's grand strategy of coercion antagonized the other powers and pushed them to respond by balancing very severely. For the contemporary case of the rise of China, I use a variety of sources such as Chinese-language materials and extensive interviews from over two years of field work in China and Asia to examine China's grand strategy of reassurance and its effect on the responses by the United States, Japan, Russia, and India.",

Previous studies on \"Chinese experimentalism\" suggest that local innovations in contemporary China stem from its ability to couple reflexive central coordination and decentralized local policy experiments.

In its basic form, certain local government actors are increasingly opening themselves up and constructing and immersing themselves in communities of practice with extra-local and non-state actors across different levels and sectors.

    "abstract": "This dissertation explores the origins of interstate reconciliation after traumatic conflicts, mainly through the comparative study of postwar Sino-Japanese and (West) German-Polish relations. While Germany and Poland have basically achieved deep reconciliation, the Sino-Japanese relationship is still dominated by mistrust and simmering animosity. I test and compare two competing theories to explain the different reconciliation outcomes. Realist theory argues that common security interests solely drive post-conflict reconciliation. I develop the second theory, historical mythmaking theory, which suggests that elite mythmaking of the conflict history for instrumental purposes will obstruct long-term reconciliation. Because national myths glorify and whitewash the action of their own nations and belittle others, they can cause the memories of former adversary states to clash. Such mutually divergent narratives will provoke negative emotions and perception of each other's hostile intention, both mechanisms contributing to bilateral conflict.

    "text": "Overcoming shadows of the past : post-conflict interstate reconciliation in East Asia and Europe This dissertation explores the origins of interstate reconciliation after traumatic conflicts, mainly through the comparative study of postwar Sino-Japanese and (West) German-Polish relations. While Germany and Poland have basically achieved deep reconciliation, the Sino-Japanese relationship is still dominated by mistrust and simmering animosity. I test and compare two competing theories to explain the different reconciliation outcomes. Realist theory argues that common security interests solely drive post-conflict reconciliation. I develop the second theory, historical mythmaking theory, which suggests that elite mythmaking of the conflict history for instrumental purposes will obstruct long-term reconciliation. Because national myths glorify and whitewash the action of their own nations and belittle others, they can cause the memories of former adversary states to clash. Such mutually divergent narratives will provoke negative emotions and perception of each other's hostile intention, both mechanisms contributing to bilateral conflict.

    "abstract": "Two puzzles dominate the study of organizational learning and counterinsurgency. First, militaries often struggle to develop effective strategies to address the problem of counterinsurgency. Second, their strategic performance seldom improves over successive counterinsurgency campaigns. This study offers a theoretical explanation for these dominant patterns of learning dysfunction. It argues that a set of closely held, professional beliefs - the military operational code - and bureaucratic preferences distort the organizations' initial response, subsequent adaptation and interwar retention. The military operational code leads militaries to misunderstand counterinsurgency in a systematic and debilitating fashion; bureaucratic interests lead them to reject the most effective strategies once they have been uncovered. When militaries manage to break with this dysfunctional pattern, it because their professional judgment is constrained; high civilian participation and/or resource scarcity force often force militaries to adopt political strategies that are less congenial but more effective in restoring state authority. This study tests the theory against six empirical cases: Indochina, the Indochina-Algeria interlude, Algeria, British Palestine, Malaya, and Thailand. These cases strongly suggest that the dysfunctional learning patterns are the product of broadly shared, professional beliefs and bureaucratic interests rather than the common, alternative explanations based on experience, culture or normative and material constraints.",

    "abstract": "This dissertation seeks to identify the causes of genocide and mass killing. Many of the most widely accepted explanations of genocide and mass killing seek the causes of these events in the social structure, system of government or the collective psychology of the societies in which they take place. Although the factors highlighted by these explanations play an important role in many cases of mass killing, I find that society at large plays a smaller role in this kind of violence than is commonly assumed. Mass killing is rarely a popular enterprise in which neighbor turns against neighbor. I argue that the causes of mass killing are best understood when the phenomenon is studied from a \"strategic\" perspective. The strategic approach suggests that the impetus for mass killing usually originates from a relatively small group of powerful political or military leaders and is often carried out without the active support of broader society. Mass killing is most accurately viewed as a goal-oriented policy -- a brutal strategy designed to accomplish leaders' most important objectives, counter their most dangerous threats, and solve their most difficult problems. In order to understand and predict mass killing, therefore, this dissertation seeks to identify the specific factors and conditions that contribute to leaders' decisions to launch mass killing. Cases of mass killing in the Soviet Union, China, Cambodia, Armenia, Nazi Germany, Rwanda, Guatemala and Afghanistan are examined.",

Two conditions make the expansion of protest across community boundaries more likely: (1) low levels of public goods, coupled with (2) economic opportunities that allow elites autonomous from the state to earn revenue.

    "abstract": "How do states change their foreign policies when they acquire nuclear weapons? This question is central to both academic and policy debates about the consequences of nuclear proliferation, and the lengths that the United States and other states should go to to prevent proliferation. Despite this importance to scholars and practitioners, existing literature has largely avoided answering this question. This dissertation aims to fill this gap. In answering this question, I first offer a typology of conceptually distinct and empirically distinguishable foreign policy behaviors that nuclear weapons may facilitate. Specifically, I distinguish between aggression, expansion, independence, bolstering, steadfastness, and compromise. The typology allows scholars and practitioners to move beyond catch-all terms such as \"emboldenment\" when thinking about how states may change their foreign policies after nuclear acquisition. Second, I offer a theory for why different states use nuclear weapons to facilitate different combinations of these behaviors. I argue that states in different geopolitical circumstances have different political priorities. Different states therefore find different combinations of foreign policy behaviors attractive, and thus use nuclear weapons to facilitate different foreign policy behaviors. The theory uses a sequence of three variables-the existence of severe territorial threats or an ongoing war, the presence of senior allies, and the state's power trajectory-to predict the combinations of foreign policy behaviors states will use nuclear weapons to facilitate. Third, I test the theory using case studies of the United Kingdom, South Africa, and the United States, each drawing on interviews and multi-archival research. In each case, I look for discontinuities in the state's foreign policy behaviors that occur at the point of nuclear acquisition and use process tracing to assess whether nuclear weapons caused the changes observed. The dissertation makes several contributions. It provides an answer to a foundational question about the nuclear revolution: how do states use nuclear weapons to facilitate their goals in international politics? It offers a new dependent variable and theory with potentially broader applicability to other questions about comparative foreign policy.

    "abstract": "This dissertation addresses the puzzle of why individuals in authoritarian systems seek office in formal institutions, which are often dismissed as weak and ineffective. I argue that individuals seek office mainly to protect their property from government expropriation in China. In contrast to prior work, I argue that instead of being passive takers of existing institutional arrangements, private entrepreneurs in China actively seek opportunities within formal institutions to advance their interests. By holding seats in local legislatures, entrepreneurs signal to local bureaucrats that they have access to higher-level government officials to report illicit predatory behavior. This signal, in turn, deters local officials from demanding bribes, ad hoc taxes, and other types of informal payments. I deploy both qualitative and quantitative methods to support the argument. First, to understand state-business relations in China, I conducted 106 in-depth interviews with private entrepreneurs, government officials, and local scholars in five provinces during 16 months of fieldwork. I show that even while government expropriation is an endemic problem, private entrepreneurs who are also legislative officeholders are less likely to experience severe expropriation. Second, using a nationally representative survey of private entrepreneurs, I quantitatively show that entrepreneurs who have seats in the local legislatures on average spend 25 percent less on informal payments to local officials compared to entrepreneurs without such a political status. To investigate the causal link between formal office and protection of property, I conducted field experiments on Chinese bureaucrats to understand how local bureaucracies respond to constituents with connections to formal institutions. These experiments involved directly contacting officials to examine how they respond to realistic messages from citizens. Using an experimental manipulation, I demonstrate that Chinese bureaucrats are 35 percent more likely to respond to a constituent with connections to formal institutions. These findings challenge prominent theories of authoritarian politics, which see authoritarian institutions as instruments to arrange power sharing, rent distribution, or information collection.

    "abstract": "Japan is a country known for its suspicion of foreigners, but Japanese citizens have established non-government organizations to support illegal foreign migrants. The problems and conditions of illegal foreign workers are rooted in Japanese government policies. The 1990 Immigration Control Law created a category of illegal foreign workers. Later, the Ministry of Health and Welfare excluded illegal foreigners from Japan's insurance system. Illegal foreign workers face challenges in dealing with employers, state officials, medical institutions, and family life. These problems range from unpaid wages and enormous medical cost to marriage/divorce registration and the forced break up of the families due to deportation. To solve these problems, Japanese engage in associative activism and institutional experimentation, which has transformed local politics in Japan. Illegal Asian workers in Japan rarely seek assistance from existing government organizations or ethnic associations. Government organizations provide mainly information and interpretation services and government officials lack the know-how to help illegal foreign workers with serious labor and immigration problems. Ethnic associations in Japan do not support their illegal compatriots. Illegal foreigners turn instead to Japanese NGOs, which have extensive experience in helping the underprivileged in Japanese society. Japanese activists, who found these NGOs, came from other social movement organizations. Christians, community workers unions organizers, women activists, labor lawyers, health workers, and civil rights activists have created separate support groups to help solve problems for illegal foreigners. Japanese activists created these groups in order to: a) acquire and accumulate knowledge on how best to help illegal foreigners; b) strengthen their bargaining power with employers and state officials; and, c) gain financial support for their activities. By working on behalf of illegal foreigners, these Japanese activists build a new community of action. Local governments have invited these activists to share their expertise and are increasingly relying on these support groups to provide public services to illegal foreigners. In some localities, local government officials have joined these groups and experimented with new institutions of governance. As a result, local governments are now breaking with national policies regarding illegal foreign workers.

    "abstract": "The internal unity and discipline of insurgent groups helps us understand the military effectiveness of armed groups, patterns of violence against civilians, and the ability of insurgent organizations to negotiate and demobilize, but the causes of insurgent cohesion and fragmentation have not been systematically or comparatively examined. This study offers a theory to explain why some armed groups are more cohesive and controlled than others. It argues that the trajectories of insurgent organizations can be substantially explained by focusing on two variables: the structure of the social networks and institutions upon which the organization is built, and the organization's access to material resources from outside the war zone. First, the structure of the core networks upon which an organization is constructed determines the internal social environment of the group: its social base shapes its organizational form. The denser the core networks, and more tightly they pull together local communities, the more robust will be the organization that emerges. Social embeddedness can therefore be more important than mass political popularity, public goods provision, or ideology in providing the basis for enduring organizational cohesion. Organizations built around coalitions of localized pockets of collective action or leaders operating among populations with whom they lack social ties will face severe problems of internal control - regardless of organizational blueprints or ethnic and class appeals. Second, external material support from states and diasporas tends to centralize internal control and to enhance insurgent military power. Rather than encouraging looting and thuggishness, resource-wealth can fuel highly cohesive and disciplined armed organizations. The interaction of social bases and external support generates empirically distinct trajectories of organizational cohesion. Mechanisms explaining change over time are derived from the structural underpinnings of this argument. This theory is tested with a study of 26 armed groups in nine civil wars. The primary research design is a set of within-conflict comparisons of insurgent organizations in civil wars in Kashmir, Northern Ireland, and Sri Lanka. Within each war there is dramatic variation across groups within a shared structural context. Fieldwork, primary sources, and secondary sources are used to trace out the different trajectories of militancy and their origins. An external validity check is provided by a study of Southeast Asia, relying on a cross-national comparison of communist insurgents in Malaya, Vietnam, and the Philippines, a sub-national, cross-conflict comparison of armed groups in Aceh and East Timor, and a within-conflict comparison of separatists in the southern Philippines.

This dissertation examines under what circumstances credit markets replace the role of welfare states to address social risks and promote social mobility in advanced democracies. It sheds light on the socio-economic and political consequences of growing debt levels. I offer a theory that explains variation in household debt across and within countries by demonstrating that credit fills gaps between households' financial needs and demand for social services on the one hand and welfare states' supply of social services on the other-a gap I refer to as social policy shortfall. The transformation of stable Fordist economies into flexible knowledge economies led to increasingly fragmented employment patterns and life-course trajectories. Welfare states, however, have often not kept up with these disruptions and leave households with larger financial burdens. Households increasingly go into debt to address the financial consequences of social risk such as unemployment or sickness as well as to seize social opportunity by investing in childcare and family, education, and housing. Cross-nationally, two factors explain the variation in household debt: the size and type of social policy shortfall determine individuals' financial needs. But whether credit emerges as a private alternative to welfare states is contingent upon the structure of a country's credit regime, which shapes how easily individuals can borrow money. Drawing on full-population administrative records from Denmark and micro-level panel data from the U.S. and Germany, I show that the permissive credit regimes of the U.S. and Denmark grant households easy access to credit, but the distribution of debt across households differs because welfare states in both countries protect and support households differently. In Germany, the restrictive credit regime results in less borrowing even in light of social policy reforms. The findings have implications for how scholars and policymakers think about the role of financial markets and household debt in a world of changing labor markets and welfare states. It shows how credit markets and welfare states appear to fulfill similar functions but follow different underlying logics, each with its own socio-economic and distributional consequences that shape and amplify insecurity and inequality.",

    "title": "Competitive intervention and its consequences for civil wars",
    "abstract": "This dissertation explores two interrelated puzzles about external intervention and internal war. The first asks why rebels, governments, and third party interveners often continue to invest in costly and protracted conflicts rather than sue for peace and a negotiated settlement. The second considers the consequences of these behaviors for temporal variation in the average duration and global prevalence of civil wars. A central finding that emerges concerns the critical role of competitive intervention-two sided, simultaneous military assistance from different third party states to both government and rebel combatants-in the dynamics and intractability of civil wars across time and around the globe. Developing a generalizable theory of competitive intervention, the dissertation explains the distortionary effects this form of external meddling has on domestic bargaining processes, describes the unique strategic dilemmas it entails for third party interveners, and links its varying prevalence to international systemic change. In doing so, it moves beyond popular anecdotes about \"proxy wars\" by deriving theoretically-grounded propositions about the strategic logics motivating competitive intervention in civil wars. It also uncovers a heretofore overlooked feature of this form of intervention-namely, that \"not losing\" is often more important than \"winning\" from the perspective of third party interveners under the shadow of inadvertent escalation. The theory is tested with a mixed-method design that combines statistical analyses of all civil wars fought between 1975 and 2009 with detailed case studies of competitive intervention in Angola (1975-1991) and Afghanistan (1979-1992). The dissertation's theoretical and empirical results shed new light on the international dimensions of civil war, address ongoing debates concerning the utility of intervention as a conflict management tool, and inform policy prescriptions aimed at resolving some of today's most violent internal conflicts.",

    "title": "Diplomacy derailed : the consequences of U.S. diplomatic disengagement",
    "abstract": "Advocates of diplomatic engagement with states of concern argue that talking to both allies and adversaries is essential for advancing U.S. foreign policy interests. Critics of this approach argue that engagement with these regimes is tantamount to appeasement and signals acceptance of behavior that ought to be condemned. In their view, little can be gained by talking to these states. Thus, diplomatic sanctions are seen as a low-cost means of isolating and delegitimizing regimes. This perspective, however, fails to recognize that maintaining diplomatic sanctions may actually entail a number of substantial costs to the United States and may even undermine economic sanctions' effectiveness. Although the U.S. has employed policies of diplomatic disengagement in approximately 30% of its economic sanctions episodes, studies have focused solely on economic sanctions. Seeking to weigh in on this debate, my doctoral dissertation focuses on two central questions: (1) What are the effects of diplomatic sanctions as a foreign policy tool? and (2) Do diplomatic sanctions increase or decrease the likelihood of target state compliance with U.S. demands? I develop and test a new theory of sanctions effectiveness focusing on the role of information, communication, and diplomatic ties. I argue that diplomatic sanctions and disengagement result in unintended consequences, including a loss of valuable intelligence, increased difficulty of communication, and reduced capabilities for public diplomacy in the target state. I also argue that when United States is more diplomatically engaged with the target state, economic sanctions are more likely to be effective in getting the target state to comply with U.S. demands. To reach these conclusions, I use both quantitative and qualitative analysis. I use economic sanctions data from 1945-2000 from the Hufbauer, Schott and Elliott database, along with original data on diplomatic sanctions. I conduct ordered logit multivariate regressions to test the diplomatic sanctions hypotheses and assess whether or not diplomatic sanctions impact the effectiveness of economic sanctions. I also conduct comprehensive longitudinal case studies of Sudan and Libya, along with a series of shorter mini-case studies focusing on Afghanistan, South Africa and Burma.",

    "abstract": "Time-series cross-sectional (TSCS) data are widely used in today's social sciences. Researchers often rely on two-way fixed effect models to estimate causal quantities of interest with TSCS data. However, they face the challenge that such models are not applicable when the so called \"parallel trends\" assumption fails, that is, the average treated counterfactual and average control outcome do not follow parallel paths. The first chapter of this dissertation introduces the generalized synthetic control method that addresses this challenge. It imputes counterfactuals for each treated unit using control group information based on a linear interactive fixed effect model that incorporates unit-specific intercepts interacted with time-varying coefficients. It not only relaxes the often-violated \"parallel trends\" assumption, but also unifies the synthetic control method with linear fixed effect models under a simple framework. The second chapter examines the effect of Election Day Registration (EDR) laws on voter turnout in the United States. Conventional difference-in-differences approach suggests that EDR laws had almost no impact on voter turnout. Using the generalized synthetic control method, I show that EDR laws increased turnout in early adopting states but not in states that introduced them more recently. The third chapter investigates the role of informal institutions on the quality of governance in the context of rural China. Using TSCS analysis and a regression discontinuity design, I show that village leaders from large lineage groups are associated with considerably more local public investment.

    "abstract": "Comparative data reveal that Japan consistently has had one of the highest poverty rates among advanced industrialized nations, yet its government taxes the poor more heavily and gives them less in public cash transfers than its peers. Why does a country, endowed with democratic institutions, deep pockets, and a sizable social welfare system provide so little public assistance to the poor? I identify two features of Japan's political and economic development that gave rise to a distinctively threadbare safety net. First, the country's late-developer status paired with state-led industrial development incentivized the primary interest groups-namely, the agrarian landlords, industrialists, and organized labor-to oppose redistribution. Second, the manner in which democratic institutions were introduced in the late nineteenth century and the subsequent expansion of suffrage enabled these groups to gain political influence and block expansion of poor relief in the Diet. Beyond formulating redistributive policies, they locked in the minimalist pattern of redistribution by denying the poor the right to vote (pre-1945) and adopting an electoral system that muted their political voice after suffrage was obtained (post-1945). Consequently, Japan's welfare state developed unevenly, featuring a heavy layer of social insurance programs that benefit well-organized interest groups and an exceptionally minimalist public assistance program for the poor. Thus, contrary to extant theories that associate democracy, economic modernization, and a robust labor movement with higher social spending for the poor, I show that these factors stifled redistribution in the case of Japan. My findings strongly suggest that how a country built its democracy and wealth influences whether a welfare state reinforces or ameliorates existing inequality.",

This thesis draws upon field research on contemporary China's news media, officials, and activists to theorize the role of publicity in non-electoral accountability. \"Publicity-driven accountability\" argues that even in highly undemocratic settings officials respond to critical media coverage for two reasons: revealing agency slippage and producing common knowledge about government failings.

The study begins with original evidence that China's Internet news outlets created forms of journalistic autonomy within the constraints of state censorship.

    "abstract": "The International Relations literature has an established view of interstate crises that explains how states pursue victory in terms of signaling resolve. States make gains with credible coercive threats (compellence). In contrast, this dissertation conceives of each crisis as a strategic competition between a challenger seeking to make gains unilaterally by fait accompli and its adversary's countervailing efforts to set red lines to deter these faits accomplis. After clarifying the neglected concepts of \"red line\" and \"fait accompli,\" the dissertation takes up two questions the literature has left unexplored: When are faits accomplis likely to occur? When are they likely to lead to war? The result is a theory of coercive conflict explaining why deterrent red lines that contain any of four weaknesses -- types of gray areas, in essence -- are especially vulnerable to faits accomplis. This theory is tested with two case studies -- the 1948-1949 Berlin Blockade Crisis and the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis -- and an analysis of gray areas and land grabs in territorial crises since 1918. Making extensive use of declassified documents, the case studies show that the \"game\" of crises need not be a matter of convincing the adversary of one's willingness to fight. Instead, states pursue victory by finding gray areas and other weaknesses in deterrent red lines that they can exploit to unilaterally take as much as possible -- often by fait accompli -- without crossing the line and overtly firing on the other side. Crises, from this standpoint, are a game of finding ways to advance without attacking. The analysis of territorial crises makes use of original data on all land grab faits accomplis since 1918. It shows first that states far more often make territorial gains by fait accompli than by coercing a territorial cession. It then focuses on the impact of geographical gray areas, which take two forms: islands located awkwardly between two core territories and border ambiguities. It finds that two-thirds of all land grabs since 1918 targeted a gray area. These gray areas render faits accomplis more effective at making a gain without provoking war and, consequently, more likely to occur.",

Parties have classically been the organizations held responsible for throwing their collective effort behind a candidate and controlling the nominations.

    "abstract": "Ever since Latin American economies collapsed in the 1980s and early 1990s, traditional redistributive programs began to coexist with new anti-poverty programs that usually took the form of conditional cash transfers (CCT). I examine the effects of the Mexican Education, Health, and Nutrition program (Progresa), the first and largest CCT implemented in the region, on electoral behavior. I argue that Progresa not only was substantially different from traditional clientelism, but that it challenged local monopolies on political power by increasing voter's income and giving recipients implicit and explicit information about its non-political nature. This weakening of monopolies, in turn, gave political parties incentives to compete for the votes of Progresa recipients. As a consequence, recipients increased their electoral participation, at least in the short term, and clientelism was irrevocably eroded. Despite the increased competition, however, recipients rewarded parties that proposed and retained Progresa. My understanding of Progresa's electoral effects is based on theory, field research on four villages, interviews with Progresa's designers and personnel, and analysis of media sources from 1996 until 2003. To test this argument, I use the Mexico 2000 Panel Study; aggregate data at the municipality level from 1997-2003; and to explicitly deal with the historic correlation between poverty, rural residence, and support for the seventy-year incumbent party, Institutional Revolutionary Party, I take advantage of the fact that early assignment of program benefits included a randomized component originally designed to evaluate the program effects on schooling and health.",

Yet liberty-reducing counter-terror laws were easily passed time and again after IRA terror attacks in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. In Israel, Yitzchak Rabin's government largely forewent abridging liberties during the Oslo peace process, but Ariel Sharon passed numerous liberty-abridging laws such as one prohibiting the granting of citizenship to Palestinians that marry Israelis during the second intifada."

    "abstract": "Nuclear weapons are the most powerful weapons in human history, but contrary to virtually every prediction by scholars, relatively few states have acquired them. Why are there so few nuclear weapons states? What factors lead governments to reject and even renounce the ultimate weapon? What do the disconfirmed predictions of widespread proliferation tell us about contemporary theories of international relations? To answer these questions, this study tests 15 hypotheses based on core categories in international politics: power, resources, ideas, and institutions. The hypotheses on power suggest that a state's nuclear decisions are a function of its external threats and its place in the international system. They claim that the slow pace of proliferation can be explained by several factors: a lack of threat, bipolarity, security guarantees, and superpower pressure. The resource hypotheses emphasize material capability, i.e., whether a state has the money, scientific talent, or access to foreign technology required to develop nuclear weapons. Hypotheses on the role of ideas often focus on the beliefs held by decision makers. This study tests the influence of anti-nuclear norms on proliferation decision making. Institutional explanations highlight either domestic institutional arrangements (whether a state is democratic, whether it is liberalizing economically, its organizational politics) or international institutions like the nonproliferation regime. Many of the tests employ a data set consisting of 132 nuclear decisions and outcomes.",

Through a study of subnational variation in Argentina, this dissertation develops a framework to explain why bureaucrats are able to enforce regulations in some cases and not others. The framework focuses on two factors: the strength of linkages between bureaucrats and civil society organizations, and the level of administrative capacity in the bureaucracy. Strong linkages can facilitate routinized resource sharing and the construction of pro-enforcement coalitions, and administrative capacity determines whether bureaucrats passively or strategically use societal resources. By explaining variation in patterns of enforcement that are obscured by existing approaches, this research opens up new possibilities for crafting strategies to strengthen regulatory institutions.

Despite the fact that right-wing governments extolling neo-liberal policies have placed privatization at the top of the policy agenda in recent years, there are some services that have experienced very little privatization, if at all. The aim of this dissertation is to explain the considerable variation in privatization experiences across service programs in different policy domains, political systems and over time. The research is based on a qualitative analysis of privatization of service delivery, while funding remains public, in three policy domains - education K-12, mental health care, and incarceration - across three different political systems - Massachusetts, Texas and England. The comparison of the nine case studies revealed significant differences in the extent of privatization across the three policy domains. Privatization rates in education were considerably lower than in the two other domains, while privatization rates in mental healthcare were higher. Despite considerable differences in institutional structure and the balance of right-left power, the differences in privatization rates across political systems did not follow any clear pattern. The explanation for the difference across policy domains primarily focus on institutional factors. Programs in policy domains with many stakeholders are less likely to be privatized than programs that are smaller by comparison.

By examining variation in governance outcomes, this research moves beyond describing new industrial policymaking to explaining its political origins.

    "abstract": "militaries learn in war by developing and testing a theory of wartime military learning in the joint operational context. In doing so, the dissertation makes three related arguments. First, it examines not just whether militaries learn in war, but how militaries learn in war. Specifically, it defines learning as a process that includes two distinct but related phases: first, identifying a problem and, second, implementing a solution. From this conceptual standpoint, the dissertation then proposes a theory of wartime military learning that can explain and predict both whether and how a military is likely to learn the lessons of war, which I call Military Filtration Theory (MFT). MFT argues that wartime military learning is best explained by examining the interaction of two key variables: first, the state's national military strategy and, second, the military's resource endowments. These two variables act as a filter on the information that is identified and absorbed by military organizations throughout the learning process. Finally, the dissertation tests MFT against several alternative explanations in the novel and challenging empirical setting of joint operations. Specifically, I examine the different experiences of the British, American, and German militaries in successfully learning to execute tactical airpower operations during World War II. In addition to demonstrating variation in the learning process, these three cases allow me to focus on a subset of joint operations that sets a high bar for existing theories of military learning in ways that the extant literature does not.

These were massively ambitious programs, with enormous budgets and unachievable technological goals. What makes them truly puzzling, though, is that they were major policies that emerged without major advocates. Although various interest groups and constituencies supported the development of alternative fuels, neither the powerful industry lobbies (oil, coal, corn, ethanol) nor the public interest groups (environment) had previously advocated for interventions of this scope and scale. This presents a fundamental empirical puzzle for public policy scholars, as it contradicts our understanding of the drivers of policy change. Typically, the policy process literature portrays radical policy change as resulting from the strategic efforts of interest or advocacy groups during a window of opportunity. Here, however, radical policy change occurred in the absence of lobbying or advocacy efforts. What explains this phenomenon? How do we account for the creation of these programs?

    "abstract": "Development scholars, heavily influenced by the cases of the four Asian Tigers (Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan), have attributed success in economic development to education. Although the Philippines seemed even more promising before the Asian Tigers began developing, the educational advances in the Philippines have led to an enormous exodus of labor. Failing to integrate its highly educated labor force in the domestic economy, the Philippine state focused its attention on exporting college-educated/highly-educated workers by creating a set of elaborate institutions to facilitate overseas employment. As a result, currently over 10 percent of its citizens live abroad in over 160 countries and about 4,600 Filipinos leave the country every day for overseas work. Why did the Philippine government develop institutions for exporting labor and why has it continued for the past four decades? This dissertation explains how the management of post-secondary educational institutions influenced the initiation and continuation of the Philippine labor export program. From its start, two interrelated problems motivated the creation of the Philippine labor exporting state: (1) over-development of the educational system through an unregulated, laissez-faire approach to private higher education and (2) underdevelopment of the economy to absorb high-skilled labor in the domestic labor market. President Ferdinand Marcos and his technocrats developed the 1974 labor export program to relieve the country of these twin problems by providing overseas employment for the educated unemployed and generating foreign currency revenues from the remittances received from Filipinos working abroad. Over time, political pressures from overseas Filipinos and migrant households, coupled with growing remittance revenue and a large private recruitment industry, led to further development of the labor exporting state with the creation of new state emigrant institutions for managing, protecting, and representing Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs). These new state institutions, overseas demand for Filipino workers, domestic demand for remittances, and a highly flexible and unregulated private higher educational system continues to drive the exporting of Filipino labor to this day. Empirically, this dissertation is based on twelve months of fieldwork in the Philippines and relies on multiple research methods: archival research, statistical methods empirically testing the relationship between post-secondary education and out-migration, over one hundred interviews of key actors in the labor export and higher education industries, quantitative data analysis using survey and census data from the 1950s through 2011, the creation and analysis of an original dataset of family ownership of all private higher educational institutions in the Philippines, and a review of government documents and legislation.",

In the 1990s, almost every government in the Latin American region attempted to reform its labor code and systems of labor relations. However, despite these attempts at reform, the labor codes and their systems of labor relations appeared resilient to change. The bulk of the literature on the political economy of reforms had concluded that labor unions had managed to stall or derailed these attempts, although unions had been unsuccessful at stopping all other market-oriented reforms. I conceptualized the labor codes and the system of labor relations considering the way they work in practice, including informal arrangements, and I use the notion of \"labor regimes\". This conceptualization differs from the dominant approach on this issue, which focuses almost exclusively on changes in labor codes approved by Congress. Using this approach, I argue that a system of rigid labor laws and centralized bargaining institutions in a more competitive, pro-business environment tends to get relaxed and more decentralized.",

In the 1990s, almost every government in the Latin American region attempted to reform its labor code and systems of labor relations. However, despite these attempts at reform, the labor codes and their systems of labor relations appeared resilient to change. The bulk of the literature on the political economy of reforms had concluded that labor unions had managed to stall or derailed these attempts, although unions had been unsuccessful at stopping all other market-oriented reforms. I conceptualized the labor codes and the system of labor relations considering the way they work in practice, including informal arrangements, and I use the notion of \"labor regimes\". This conceptualization differs from the dominant approach on this issue, which focuses almost exclusively on changes in labor codes approved by Congress. Using this approach, I argue that a system of rigid labor laws and centralized bargaining institutions in a more competitive, pro-business environment tends to get relaxed and more decentralized."

    "title": "Bankruptcy, guns or campaigns : explaining armed organizations' post-war trajectories",
    "abstract": "This project seeks to explain what happens to armed organizations after they sign peace accords. Why do they dissolve, return to war, or form non-violent socio-political entities (political parties or civic associations)? To explain variation in post-war outcomes, my argument centers on the human geography of armed groups. Recruitment, deployment, and post-war migration patterns generate distinct configurations of a) collective capacity, b) relations with civilians, and c) inter-armed group dynamics. I propose that, if a rebel or paramilitary unit recruits in a geographically concentrated area and deploys its fighters in their home communities, the organization will persist and transform into a socio-political entity after disarming. If instead the organization recruits in a dispersed manner, deploys its soldiers away from their towns of origin, and the soldiers either return home or displace to a third locale, the group will disintegrate; it will lose its capacity for collective action. By bankrupting some organizations and preserving others, demobilization has differential effects on armed group capacity. Where it weakens a group, it destabilizes the territorial bargains between the ex-armed group and state and between the group and its contiguous, non-state armed actors. As a result, resumed war becomes likely. If instead, the distribution of power within the system is maintained, the groups will, over time, fully demilitarize and be brought into the state's legal framework. This dissertation is based on rich data collected during fourteen months of fieldwork in Colombia from 2006 to the present during which time I went inside each demobilizing organization to reconstruct and map its postwar trajectory. Exploiting Colombia's unparalleled comparative laboratory for this research, I test the effect of recruitment, deployment, and post-war migration patterns on organizational outcomes using two strategies. First, I conduct a detailed, controlled comparison of armed groups in three regions of Colombia based on interviews of over 200 ex-combatants, civilians, and victims. The second strategy combines these qualitative sources with quantitative ones to evaluate the proposed hypotheses on the entire universe of municipality-armed group dyads in Colombia (n=1040). For this analysis, I rely on municipal-level violent event data, interviews of nearly 100 Colombian experts on the armed conflict, a database of seven years of news articles, and statistical evidence from a series of surveys of former paramilitaries (n=31,472). The empirics provide strong support for the proposed model. The project has significant implications for debates on reintegration, state-building, consolidating peace, reconciliation, decriminalization, and transitions to democracy.",

    "abstract": "The dissertation seeks to explain the transformation in the response by the United States to the challenge of global AIDS. Between 1998 and 2008, U.S. spending on global AIDS increased 50-fold to over $6 billion. Most conventional explanations of international politics and foreign assistance give a dominant role to various conceptions of interest, including key economic interests and the strategic interest of powerful states. This dissertation tests these dominant theories against a hypothesis that suggests a more significant role for norms and norm entrepreneurs in shaping political decisions. Neither the influence of important economic interests nor the national security interest of the United States can adequately explain the transformation in U.S. global AIDS policy. Instead, an emerging norm around the duty to provide AIDS treatment and the norm entrepreneurs who championed this idea were the driving force in shaping the U.S. response to global AIDS. Emerging norms require effective champions to capture the attention of a wider public and the support of political leaders. Norm entrepreneurs will be most successful when they adopt the strategies of symbolic politics, leverage politics and accountability politics to influence political leaders.",

    "abstract": "Intellectual Property is an ideology of the late Twentieth Century which reserves property-like rights in information, so that creators may extract its economic value. Current American copyright law draws mainly from this concept; it has been constructed through history by negotiation between various established economic interests. Information Freedom is a competing ideology which has been successful in the software community. It emphasizes the dangers of over-propertization and the benefits of freely accessible resources, especially non-depletable information resources. Compromise must be reached in a practical (non-ideological) fashion in order to achieve the social goals of: production of creative content (encouraged by fair but not excessive compensation for creators); promotion of scientific, political, technical, artistic, cultural, and economic progress by removing obstacles to accessing content and taking advantage of innovations which change the status quo; protection of creative freedom; and ensuring quality and diversity in the content which is created. Civil disobedience as a means to achieve these goals may be counterproductive if it results in tighter technological restrictions on content availability or stricter legal mechanisms; legal reforms proposed by Lawrence Lessig and Jessica Litman are unlikely to be enacted. Internet-based technologies have strong potential to increase exposure to diversity, decrease costs, and improve the subjective experience for music consumers. Cheaper film-making equipment may have similar positive effects for motion pictures to a lesser degree.

    "abstract": "This thesis examines the historical conditions that have contributed to high rates of vaccine innovation in the U.S. during the twentieth century. Empirical analysis of vaccine license data demonstrates that the highest rates of innovation were achieved during the 1940's. Historical analysis of this data indicates that a large percentage of these innovations were the product of World War II vaccine development programs. Participation in these programs fostered a uniquely productive culture of collaboration between military and industrial vaccine developers that persisted through the postwar era, maintaining innovation rates through the 1960's and early 1970's. By the mid-1970's, however, the historical circumstances and cultural factors that engendered and sustained military-industrial collaboration began to change, causing rates of vaccine innovation to fall and vaccine stocks to dwindle. Poor economic incentives for vaccine development are often cited as the reason for falling rates of innovation. This explanation is correct but incomplete, because, for example, economic incentives for vaccine development were poor during the 1940's and 1950's, when innovation rates were high. I demonstrate that vaccine innovation is tied to levels of military-industrial collaboration and that declining rates of innovation in recent decades are associated with the disruption of this military-industrial culture of collaboration. Finally, drawing on lessons from this history of military-industrial relations, I examine the opportunities and challenges that the new \"war on terrorism\" presents for efforts to improve vaccine innovation and supplies.",

    "abstract": "This dissertation is a two-theme ethnography focusing on the early history of one company within the context of the turbulent business environment of the 1990's. One theme is the control exercised by a corporation to mold its people to achieve certain productive ends, focusing on three areas: culture, physical environment and technology. The second theme is the ability of a corporation to be flexible. Taken together, the two themes form the self-contradictory notion of trying to control a group to increase its ability to be flexible. Many writers who focus on organizations have found the biological metaphor of evolution a useful way to conceptualize some aspects of a successful firm. In contrast I find the biological metaphor of genetic manipulation best illustrates the kind of control exercised by the leadership of this particular firm. From its inception, the leadership team wanted to create a flexible firm, one that could thrive in a turbulent environment. Rather than rely on a multiplicity of heterogeneous experiments, they actively manipulated specific aspects of the firm. The early results, the formation of a successful company, suggested that those controls and the decision to actively mold the firm using such controls were the right choices. When faced with a radical change in the marketplace, the arrival of the Internet economy, the leaders of this firm responded with the same technique and once again were able to mold a successful firm. To the extent that the Internet economy requires companies to change at Internet speed, this firm's ability to manipulate its own \"DNA\" may well be a model for success for other firms in this environment.",

    "abstract": "This ethnography tracks visualization and pedagogy in the burgeoning field of structural biology. Structural biologists are a multidisciplinary group of researchers who produce models and animations of protein molecules using three-dimensional interactive computer graphics. As they ramp up the pace of structure determination, modeling a vast array of proteins, these researchers are shifting life science research agendas from decoding genetic sequence data to interpreting the multidimensional forms of molecular life. One major hurdle they face is training a new generation of scientists to work with multi-dimensional data forms. In this study I document the formation and propagation of tacit knowledge in structural biology laboratories, in classrooms, and at conferences. This research shows that structural biologists-in-training must cultivate a feel for proteins in order to visualize and interpret their activity in cells. I find that protein modeling relies heavily on a set of practices I call the body-work of modeling. These tacit skills include: a) forms of kinesthetic knowledge that structural biologists gain through building and manipulating molecular models, and by using their own bodies as mimetic models to help them figure out how proteins move and interact; and b) narrative strategies that assume a teleological relationship between form and function, and which figure proteins through analogies with familiar human-scale phenomena, such as the pervasive description of proteins as \"machines.\" What I find is that these researchers are not only transforming the objects of life science research: they are training a new generation of life scientists in forms of knowing attuned to the chemical affinities, physical forces and movements of protein molecules, and keyed to the tangible logic and rhetoric of \"molecular machines.\"",

These tacit skills include: a) forms of kinesthetic knowledge that structural biologists gain through building and manipulating molecular models, and by using their own bodies as mimetic models to help them figure out how proteins move and interact; and b) narrative strategies that assume a teleological relationship between form and function, and which figure proteins through analogies with familiar human-scale phenomena, such as the pervasive description of proteins as \"machines.\" What I find is that these researchers are not only transforming the objects of life science research: they are training a new generation of life scientists in forms of knowing attuned to the chemical affinities, physical forces and movements of protein molecules, and keyed to the tangible logic and rhetoric of \"molecular machines.\""

    "title": "The rules of perception : American color science, 1831-1931",
    "abstract": "Although vision was seldom studied in Antebellum America, color and color perception became a critical field of scientific inquiry in the United States during the Gilded Age and progressive era. Through a historical investigation of color science in the United States in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, I argue that attempts to scientifically measure, define, and regulate color were part of a wider program to construct a more rational, harmonious, and efficient American polity starting from one of the very baseline perceptual components of reality - the experience of color. As part of this program, I argue secondly that color science was as much a matter of prescription as description - that is, color scientists didn't simply endeavor to reveal the facts of perception and apply them to social problems, they wanted to train everyday citizens to see scientifically, and thereby create citizens whose eyes, bodies, and minds were both medically healthy and morally tuned to the needs of the modern American nation. Finally, I argue not simply that perception has a history - i.e. that perceptual practices change over time, and that, for Americans of a century ago, experiences of color sensations were not taken as given but had to be laboriously crafted - but also that this history weighs heavily upon our present day understanding of visual reality, as manifested not least of all in scientific studies of vision, language, and cognition. Employing a close reading of the archival and published sources of a range of actors including physicist Ogden Rood, semiotician Charles Peirce, logician Christine Ladd-Franklin, board game magnate Milton Bradley, and art professor Alfred Munsell, among others, this study reveals the origins of some of the most deeply-rooted conceptions of color in modern American culture.",

    "title": "The Yellow Revolution in Malwa : alternative arenas of struggle and the cultural politics of development",
    "abstract": "This dissertation engages with two analytical frameworks to explore questions of social transformation and structures of power in rural society in India. The first is a specific critique of various types of development discourse and development projects that have been elaborated by national and international elites during the last forty years, focusing on the dry land Malwa region in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. This includes a project to introduce soyabean cultivation to the region in the 1970s, which has been post-facto labeled as a yellow revolution, and a discourse which argues that providing market information through new information and communication technologies is empowering farmers. I argue that these projects and discourse have mostly steered away from engaging with the structures of power framing rural society, and thus, have failed to bring about much change in the condition of rural people in central India. The second analytical framework is a recovery and foregrounding of alternate arenas of struggle that rural people in the Malwa region have been participating in. The platform of democratic politics is one such avenue that marginalized groups have used to make demands upon the state to provide them with support and allows them to hold the state accountable for the same. Participating in cultural projects that question and subvert the forms of caste and gender based exclusion that frame the lives of people is another such arena which provides women and adivasis (tribals) with a language of empowerment. This research argues that for the language and practice of development to have more relevance to the lives of the poor and for it to engage with the deeper aspirations in their lives, the role of these political and cultural projects as vital platforms for rural people to exercise agency and bring about change, must be recognized.",

    "abstract": "This dissertation provides a multiscalar analysis of climate change solutions from the global South by investigating how bioscientists are leveraging postcolonial ecological legacies into the basis for what they envision as a sustainable future. In Brazil, scientists from different disciplines are reengineering sugarcane-a crop central to the colonial project-at molecular, organismic, and economic scales in order to expand biofuels as international energy commodities. I argue that biology has become central to what I call the plantation network: a postcolonial agricultural formation that includes laboratories as obligatory passage points in the growing of plants to meet human needs and desires, especially in the era of \"sustainability\" and \"green capitalism.\" My research uses the plantation network formation to show that even though Brazilian scientists work under ethical and ecological threats posed by climate change, they also rely on Brazilian history, ideology, and cultural practices as they reshape life forms, landscapes, and labor in Brazil and Mozambique. This multisited analysis draws on ethnographic research conducted with molecular biologists attempting to create the world's first commercially viable transgenic sugarcane plant, biochemists working to develop waste-reducing fermentation technologies by using bioprospected \"wild\" yeasts to digest sugarcane bagasse, and a think tank of agronomic economists seeking to transfer a \"Brazilian biofuel model\" to Lusophone Mozambique. For these scientists, Brazil's long history of sugarcane is coming to center on ethoses and practices of what they call \"sustentabilidade\" (sustainability): a form of technoscientifically-aided industrial development that contributes to environmental wellbeing while maintaining the possibility of continued capitalist production for future populations. The dissertation examines \"sustainability\" as it has emerged in these sites by considering the plantation as a pharmakon-like entity: at the same time (1) a destructive nexus of social-ecological relations that has propelled the harmful, unjust conditions that have led to calls for \"sustainable\" practices and principles and (2) a redemptive space for ethically-sound renewable fuel and food production that scientists believe is central to creating a more just, livable world. I investigate how scientific practices related to ethically-rendered biofuels are motivating changes to the biotechnologies, production techniques, and locations of sugarcane plantations.",

    "abstract": "Modern U.S. traffic safety policy is largely guided by three overarching principles that have influenced governments, industry, and community and citizen activists since the 1940s. The terms, education, engineering, and enforcement, detailed in the Action Program for Traffic Safety were developed by engineers and U.S. federal government traffic safety experts in response to growing concerns around rising traffic fatalities. In these guidelines, and the iterations that developed from them, responsibility for traffic safety shifted between drivers, policy makers, and the automotive industry. My dissertation examines the evolution of traffic safety policy, specifically looking at solutions to reach zero fatalities, over multiple decades. The traffic safety experts, including the auto industry, federal government, and community activists, striving for zero fatalities have reshaped traffic infrastructure, automotive regulation, and consumer perceptions of risky behaviors in an attempt to solve a major public health issue. Broadly following four themes, infrastructure, institutions, technology, and behavior, each chapter highlights how these actors mitigated risks and defined safety in order to find solutions to highway fatalities. To safety-concerned government officials and industry leaders, central actors in the development of federal traffic safety policy, traffic safety encompassed engineering, education, enforcement, citizenship, humanitarian, and moral issues. On the other hand, to women's community and activist groups, like MADD, traffic safety's focus was the education of drivers and pedestrians, and the prevention of crashes through educational and public health approaches. However, to working class white males, government mandated safety was viewed as an infringement upon their freedom as individuals to choose how to be safe and how to define their level of safety, regardless of its effects on others. Through analysis of these narratives emerges a more complete picture of the public health, education, and social policy implications of twentieth century traffic safety, the role of citizen activism in traffic safety policy development at the local, state, and federal levels, and the ways in which the traffic safety solutions have shifted over time.",

I find that although actors within and outside the environmental movement recognize a collective failure to influence the U.S. policy process on climate change issues, their organizations have been unable to adapt to the current political environment. My data derives from extensive participant observation, semi-structured interviews with organizational staff and experts, and statistical analysis of organizational efforts to recruit volunteer participants and develop their leadership over a two-year period. I follow four environmental organizations as they sought to create of a national climate-focused social movement. Working in collaborative partnership with other state- and national-level NGOs under the moniker of the \"Climate Coalition,\" they initiated pilot organizing campaigns in June 2011 in three U.S. cities toward three intertwined goals of 1) building social movement power via local coalitions, 2) developing volunteer leadership capable of forging a social movement community, and 3) mobilizing the resources of that constituency in collective action to effect change. In Chapter 1, looking first at the network of organizations that comprised the Climate Coalition, I show that the network's novel configuration - a third party network administrator both coordinated the activities of the participating organizations and worked with them to set the network's strategy - produced rather than diminished the tensions inherent in inter-organizational collaboration. Turning next to the organizations themselves in Chapter 2, I explore the challenges of integrating new types of experts and expertise into existing organizational structures. In particular, I suggest that the focus on involving volunteer expertise through community organizing disrupted existing organizational notions of expertise and prevented large-scale organizational embrace of the movement building work. Finally, in Chapter 3 1 examine the experiences of the volunteers on one of the movement building campaigns, and argue that the role of the community organizer in cultivating and developing volunteer leadership is essential for understanding the long-term success of movement building work.",

This dissertation tries to understand the world of birth under the regime of closures and fragmentation that governs the lives of Palestinians. It describes how checkpoints, closures, curfews have come to characterize childbirth in Palestine. It illustrates how the changing infrastructure, economy and discourse around birth produce new experiences of life in the medical sphere and in a family. Oral histories, life histories, doctors', midwives' and mothers' accounts, news reports and literature speak of these new conditions and experiences of birth and life. The meanings and structures of medicine, family and motherhood are thus remade. Oral histories focus on a history of the health infrastructure and movements in medicine, in particular the sumud (steadfastness) movement and the popular health movement. They illustrate how the figure of the doctor overlaps with that of the political leader. They identify the new health infrastructures built to assist birth during the closure which have different politics than the earlier movements, marking the post-socialist age, but show remarkable continuities with them in their emergence, mobilization and hierarchies. These new infrastructures, economies and discourses produce changing stories about birth and changing subjects. I identify two genres of birth stories, the first, narrated by mothers and the second, collected from newspapers. The former is in the register of the ordinary. The mothers remember the space of the hospital, a socio-economic space signaling class, as well as the trip from home to hospital and back. The stories seem uncanny. Occupation, closures and warfare are simply part of the ordinary. By contrast, the newspaper birth stories are sensational. They tell of checkpoint and prison births, occupation, suffering and resistance. They speak of miraculous redemption but in opposition to mothers' narrations, they are familiar. Finally, listening to the inner worlds of birth-mothers under the impress of economic, political and domestic pressures this dissertation distinguishes \"enclosure\" as a worldview caused by occupation and family relations, thus re-evaluating meanings of family, motherhood and life.",

    "abstract": "This dissertation illuminates how expert labor makes a complex natural substance into a uniform global commodity. Drawing on both published sources and extensive archival research in the continental United States, in Scotland, and in Puerto Rico, it provides new insight into the workings of the empires of commodities that define modem capitalism. Chapter 1 shows that the notion that sugar has a single valuable molecular essence sucrose- has been used to explain its history as a commodity. Yet this essentialism is not a natural fact but a product of the political economy of the late nineteenth century itself. From the seventeenth century on, sugar production had relied on the experienced multisensory techniques of enslaved craftsmen. But after 1860, newly sophisticated factories began to appear throughout the Caribbean, producing sugar of unprecedented consistency and quality. Chapter 2 explores how the work of chemists was essential to managing labor within these new factories, whose owners attempted to eliminate the need for artisan work. Yet the more successfully chemists extracted sucrose from sugarcane, the more mechanical and obvious they made that extraction appear, and the more they effaced their own necessity. These efforts to use scientific expertise to de-skill sugar production were made possible, Chapter 3 shows, by the persistence of craft and cooperative production in Glasgow, where those factories' machines were built. Sugar engineering firms cultivated relationships with distant plantations, ensuring that draftsmen and engineers could design, maintain, and repair machines that would last many decades. It therefore shows how the devices that facilitated sugar's commodification have human histories themselves. Finally, Chapter 4 reveals how the valuation of sugar became a central political issue in the postbellum United States. The Federal government feared its means of enforcing sugar tariffs was being undermined by fraud on the part of Customs officers and by new forms of sugar itself. But supposedly objective chemical techniques were even harder for the state to supervise. In showing how powerful refiners shaped scientific practices to their own advantage, this chapter provides a new framework for historians' analyses of science, commodities, and corruption in the nineteenth century.",

    "title": "Technologies of living substance : tissue culture and cellular life in twentieth century biomedicine",
    "abstract": "This thesis is a historical and cultural analysis of the development of tissue culture, that is, techniques for growing living cells and tissues outside of the bodies of complex organisms. The development of these techniques represents an important epistemological shift in biology from in vivo to in vitro experimentation. This was not just a shift from use of a whole organ/organism to use of a fragment of the body, but a shift in the visualization and conceptualization of the body and its processes as they occur at the level of cells and tissues. Here it is argued that tissue culture was an essential part of a new sense of cellular life, not as a static building block of larger bodies, but as a dynamic and interactive entity which undergoes constant change, and is the functional unit of processes of growth, reproduction, aging, cancer, infection, and death. The thesis begins with an analysis of the work of embryologist Ross Harrison in growing isolated fragments of embryonic nerve tissue outside of the body in 1907. It follows the elaboration of Harrison's work by the surgeon Alexis Carrel, and the more general development of the technique over the early decades of the twentieth century. There is a close examination of the techniques for visualizing cellular life grown outside of the body, as well as the appearance of reactions to this form of life in a wider public culture. The methodological approach is a close examination of the material practices of tissue culture laboratories, and the images, ideas, and information about cells and their relation to bodies produced thereby. The movement of these ideas and images from laboratory to public culture and back is at the center of the final chapters, in which the history of the first widely used human cell line, HeLa, is examined, and more recent legal and ethical debates about the status and ownership of the Mo cell line. Rather than being a comprehensive history of tissue culture, this thesis takes historical episodes from this twentieth century biomedical practice to analyze the constitution of cellular life through the objects of tissue culture, and the ways in which these objects have been scientifically, technically, and culturally productive.",

With this technological change came a fundamental transformation of the defining features of rural life after World War II.

Trucking and rural truck drivers were at the heart of what I call the \"marketing machine,\" a new kind of food economy that arose after World War II, characterized by decentralized food processors and supermarkets seeking high volume, low prices, and consistent quality to eliminate uncertainties from the food distribution chain. This marketing machine developed as a reaction against the statist food and farm policies of the New Deal.

    "abstract": "This dissertation traces the history of shipboard command and control systems in the United States Navy from 1899, when the service first conducted experiments with wireless telegraphy, through World War II, the conflict which witnessed the birth of the modern shipboard information processing facility. It argues that early-to-mid twentieth century naval officers' development and employment of increasingly sophisticated shipboard command and control systems fundamentally altered the human experience of warfare at sea. Based predominately on archival research, Managing a Sea of Information follows a narrative format. It begins by examining the United States Navy's adoption of radio and challenges the notion that a conservative officer corps failed to appreciate the potential advantages of this new communications technology. The bulk of the study explores the Navy' s development of shipboard command and control systems from World War I through the beginning of World War II, focusing particularly on the efforts of operational commanders to maximize their capabilities through the adoption of devices, methods, and procedures for the collection, processing, and dissemination of information. These efforts gradually changed the nature of command at sea, from an environment in which commanders could make informed tactical decisions with relatively limited input from subordinates, to one characterized by epistemic actions and socially-distributed cognition.

This dissertation considers contemporary influenza policy as a case study in what I call medical politics, in which a disease that for most people is rather unremarkable has become the focus of intense (and costly) public health campaigns based on a shaky scientific basis. The dissertation seeks to explain how this could happen. The first two chapters show how influenza and its pandemics are marketed through an appeal to numerous scientific claims. Drawing on governmental marketing materials, statements by officials, and policy documents, I try to let officials speak for themselves and, as much as possible, refrain from analysis. Chapter 3 tells the story of the 2009 novel influenza H1N1 outbreak, showing how official understandings about influenza were called into question by an outbreak far milder than experts had predicted, and discusses investigations which highlighted the role of industry in shaping influenza policy. Chapter 4 analyzes official scientific claims regarding influenza, and argues that degree to which influenza is a serious public health problem is actually unclear. Furthermore, influenza vaccine effectiveness has been vastly overstated, predictive models of pandemic influenza are demonstrably flawed, and officials conflate true influenza with influenza-like illness (ILl), an often overlooked but critical distinction which allows officials to mislead the public into holding false assumptions about the potential benefits of influenza vaccine. Chapter 5 highlights the centrality of \"virus-centric thinking\" and the ethic of \"saving lives\" in public health practice as important factors that help explain how such a situation can exist and persist in light of the evidence.

Derived from a manual Javanese textile printing technique, Dutch Wax cloth has been machine-printed in the Netherlands since the late 19th century, and was introduced to West Africa in the early 20th century. Lomé, Togo was a hub for its distribution throughout West and Central Africa for much of the 20th century. The cloth's visual and material attributes were historically developed through exchanges between West African consumers and European manufacturers and Dutch Wax has since been integrated into both dress practices and processes of social reproduction in Togo, as in much of West Africa. Further, in recent years, the cloth's producer has been rebranding itself from a textile manufacturer for Africa into a global luxury design and fashion brand. As such, Dutch Wax cloth has and continues to not only mediate but also embody West African participation in the global. By examining how Dutch Wax is \"done\" in various sites of practice along its path-how it is given form, and what is produced alongside these forms-this multi-sited ethnography brings to light how Africa's relationship to and place in the global is negotiated in the practices of designers, advertisers, sellers, buyers, and tailors across the Netherlands, Togo, and \"the global.\" I argue that the view of Africa-in-the-world (Ferguson 2006) that emerges in each of these sites of practice and across all five is one that is characterized by a tenuous play between absence and presence, visibility and invisibility, inclusion and exclusion.

    "abstract": "The dissertation is an historical study of the interactions between technologists and museums in the late nineteenth United States, the role of international expositions-such as Philadelphia in 1876 and Chicago in 1893-in these interactions, and the rise of technology collections in those museums. Through archival sources, as well as published primary and secondary source material, the dissertation examines the role of engineers and the public in creating technological collections in museums dominated by natural history specimens. It focuses on intersections between industry, engineers, international expositions, and museums in the nineteenth century by considering the cases of the Smithsonian's National Museum and the Field Columbian Museum. This research explores technology and its cultural roles, how technology related to or differed from other aspects of American culture, and how this may have precluded the establishment of a national museum dedicated to mechanical arts, technology and America's inventor citizens, even while some engineers brokered a place for technological collections to develop. Despite objections and a lack of support from the higher administration within the museums, mechanical and technological collections developed. In an era of enthusiasm for technology, invention, and mechanics, forces outside the museums pushed the development of the collections. In particular, a group of engineers, as curators and exhibit designers; played roles in the celebration of technological achievement and at the expositions, in the attempts to establish mechanical arts and technology collections at the two prominent museums, and in the connections between technologists and museums that proved essential to the development of the collections. In addition, pressure from a public audience enthused about technology and machines aided such collections by influencing museum administration. This dissertation argues that engineers became mediators between the museum world and the world of engineering by brokering the culture of technology and securing a subordinate, yet permanent place for technology within the museum world. Key issues in the negotiation and brokering include the nature of the culture of technology, the professionalization process of engineers and their need for social status and cultural recognition, and the place of technology in nineteenth century lives and hierarchies.",

    "title": "Twitter and the body parodic : global acts of re-creation and recreation",
    "abstract": "This dissertation investigates Twitter parody accounts as a form of social critique and linguistic play across English, Japanese, and Arabic-one that is collaboratively created by the users, policymakers, and architects of Twitter. Together, apart, and in different constellations with governments and news media, these actors use parody accounts to recreate and experiment with everything from law to what constitutes a person. I argue that the Twitter parody account, both as negative critique and ambiguous personification play, is an off-platform use-an unintended use of platform, site, or app that is allowed to endure, with varying degrees of official encouragement, silence, and ignorance. Drawing on ethnographic, linguistic, and legal analysis, the dissertation details the contours of this use, its adversaries and proponents among traditional structures of authority, and how the platform has ratified and deployed it globally. Chapter 1, Aspect Shift, examines how a parody account works at a linguistic level through the name and profile photo play of a classic political parody account. Chapter 2, The Account-Person, proposes that personhood on Twitter is a cyborg entity and investigates five elements the shape this account-person: number, body, position, world, and time. Turning to parody accounts' relationship with authority, chapter 3, Warranting Parody, investigates why some in positions of authority mobilize apparatuses of power against parody accounts. Not all governmental employees, however, see parody accounts as threats. Chapter 4, Tweeting Like a State, explores the development of norms around parody among a key, but often overlooked group of contemporary interpreters of representative government: governmental social media managers. Chapter 5, The Social Media Contract, argues that the history of Twitter's parody policy is the history of its still-emerging social contract, a contract shaped by user demands, the abdication of traditional authorities, and Twitter's own interests. This social contract has uneven globality-as chapter 6, Of Policyness and Global Polysemy, shows through examining Twitter's parody policy across languages. Finally, in the conclusion I bring these various strands together through the concept of usership, a member relationship entangled with citizenship yet largely asserted and negotiated with corporations rather than governments.",

This spans the period between the boom and bust in the cotton trade during and after the American Civil War - when Bombay was a colonial mercantile port - to its emergence as of one of India and Asia's largest industrial cities after the First World War. Separate chapters explore the history of railway and telegraph networks, standardisation and time-keeping, land acquisition and valuation, cadastral surveying and property registration, and the urban built environment. From the perspective of the colonial city, the history of these formations looks less like the smooth unfolding of singular standards of money, time or space, than a protracted war of position fought out across a century by experts, elites and the masses. This thesis seeks to deepen the social and political history of urbanization in South Asia beyond concepts of colonial technology transfer or nationalist resistance by examining the everyday politics of stock and real estate speculation, public clocks, land and private property, maps and topographical surveys, and buildings and streets in colonial Bombay.

    "abstract": "This dissertation focuses on the pursuits of a particular subset of automobile users: hot rodders, those who modify their standard production automobiles for improved performance. More specifically, this project examines the history of the speed equipment industry - the aftermarket subsector which manufactures high-performance products for hot rodders - from its infancy in the 1910s through the mid 1980s. The thesis begins by examining the role of technological enthusiasm in the early growth of hot rodding, focusing in particular on the ways in which this enthusiasm led a handful of individuals to begin to manufacture high-performance parts in the 1910s, 1920s, and 1930s. After tracing the wartime experiences of these industry pioneers, the project then explores the ways in which, in the midst of America's postwar affluence, the spectacular growth both of the high-performance industry and of hot rodding itself helped spawn the youth-oriented musclecar movement upon which the Big Three would later feed. In its examination of the 1940s and 1950s, the dissertation closely examines the evolution of this industry's production methods in an attempt to understand the manufacturing dynamics of a market-sensitive, flexibly-oriented, late-twentieth-century industrial sector.",

    "abstract": "Evidence from history, archaeology, and the social sciences suggests that making models of the world has anchored our understanding of it since the earliest days. From models of deities, dwellings and weapons to molecules and planetary systems, models have been tools for thinking and imagining, as well as planning and building. Though there are many possible definitions, a digital model is understood here essentially as a miniature virtual world-a distillation that captures the essence of some aspect of the larger physical or imagined world-which provides a vehicle for virtual exploration or manipulation of that world, and a focal point for debates about its nature. This dissertation explores the communities engaged in making 3D digital models used in computer animation-globally dispersed communities linked by their professional tools and practices and their shared use of algorithms to sculpt geometry in the spaces of the machine. My research builds on the work of historians of computing and computer-aided design as well as insights on objects and their meanings by scholars such as Sherry Turkle, Peter Galison and Loraine Daston. To this conversation I contribute a view of digital models as meaningful objects, both tactile and evocative, around which conversations on expertise, craft, nature and representation coalesce. I draw on the work of Merritt Roe Smith on the contributions of government funding to innovation, and David Kaiser's work on the role of representations in circulating professional identities and shaping professional communities. Finally I draw on the work of those who have thought deeply about creativity and digital design tools and practices, including Rudolph Arnheim and Malcolm McCullough. I have also benefitted from Lev Manovich's work on software in the evolving field of digital humanities and software studies. I base my understanding of 3D modeling practices on a series of interviews conducted with a widely-dispersed community of artists, programmers and technical specialists who collaborate, sometimes over great distances, in creating 3D models for the entertainment industry. I argue that the idea of 3D modeling was shaped by the intersections of contrasting styles of abstraction practiced by artists and engineers. The interactions of present-day modelers with their models are part of an emerging discourse with the world, opening new possibilities for human interaction with the world's objects. As an example of the complex, global flow of people, objects and ideas I contrast two animation studios on opposite sides of the world, located in Connecticut and New Zealand. Though each of these is far from Hollywood-traditionally regarded as the heart of the film and animation industries-3D modeling practices, shared software and migrating workers link them to each other and to a global community of 3D thinkers and makers. Digital 3D modeling-sculpting characters, objects and environments, and even 3D printing the objects-emerges as a powerful way of connecting the self to the world.

Based on ethnographic and historical methods, I explore how information and communication technologies, and spatial designs combined with specific organizational visions shape the social organization and culture of work. Analyzing ideas as well as material configurations, design as well as use, and developments in offices as well as those beyond the office, I am particularly concerned with the new forms of life and cultural formations these developments produce. The 1990s saw a development towards more flexible, mobile and virtual ways of officing, such as non-territorial offices and remote work. Analyzing the alternative officing movement in the context of wider economic and cultural changes, I demonstrate the strategic role technology plays for the movement's vision of a less place-based definition of work. Suggesting an alternative intellectual origin for today's office concepts different from Taylorism, I opt for the concept of office landscaping, an influential German office concept developed after WW2 and inspired by cybernetics. Fieldwork in a present day innovative office design firm reveals a deep tension in its office designs between a more flexible and mobile organizational goal, and a more communicative and collaborative one - a tension that is exacerbated by technology. Further exploring the designers' own mobile and non-territorial office, I introduce the notion of placemaking to explain the observed friction in the mobile ways of the office. I also find a reconfigured power dynamic that is no longer based on space ownership, but rather on mobility and ownership of technology, or \"techno-territory.\"",

This dissertation examines the emergence and development of executive coaching in the United States as a new form of professional expertise. Drawing on eighteen months of ethnographic research, the majority of which took place in New York City, this study analyzes the ways in which executive coaching brings together theories of individual psychology and of organizational efficiency in order to increase functionality and productivity at work. Executive coaching is: a) a new form of professional expertise, b) a management tool to increase productivity and efficiency at work, c) a window to changing notions of the self and personhood in America and, finally d) an access point to the corporate world. This study explores these four dimensions of executive coaching. I argue that the emergence of coaching is a product of and a response to a fast changing business environment where continuous improvement is required to adapt to the volatility of changes. Change in the larger context (corporate settings and business environments) is not to be resisted or criticized but to be enabled through the change of the self. This dissertation illustrates and explains the grounds of a shift away from systemic approaches and systemic criticism towards individualistic approaches. Coaching emerges in and becomes an illustration of a neo-liberal economy that emphasizes constant retraining of a self that is versatile, pragmatic and fragmented.",

    "abstract": "This dissertation traces a transformation in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's governance of food markets during the second half of the 20th century. In response to new correlations between diet and risk of disease, anxieties about (over)abundant food supplies, and changing notions of personal versus collective responsibility in an affluent society, the FDA changed how it regulated food labeling. Following WWII, the agency developed a set of standard recipes with fixed common name labels (such as \"peanut butter\" or \"tomato soup\"), or \"standards of identity,\" for all mass-produced foods. However, the appearance of new diet foods and public health concerns undermined this system. Beginning in the 1970s, the FDA shifted its policies. Rather than rely on standardized identities, the agency required companies to provide informative labels such as the ingredients panel, nutrition labels, and various science-based health claims. Agency officials believed that such information would enable consumers to make responsible health decisions through market purchases. Food labeling is explored as a regulatory assemblage that draws together a variety of political, legal, corporate, and technoscientific interests and practices. The five chapters are organized chronologically. The first two describe how a shift in focus among nutrition scientists from concern for the undernourished to a concern with overeating led to the introduction onto the market of engineered foods capitalizing off popular interest in diet and health. A middle chapter describes a series of institutional scandals that generated the political animus to change the FDA's system, and registered a broader \"shock of recognition\" that Americans' views about food and food politics had changed. The final two chapters describe the introduction of \"Nutrition Information\" labeling in the 1970s and the mandatory \"Nutrition Facts\" panel in the 1990s. By looking at the regulation of labels as a kind of public-private infrastructure for information, the turn to compositional labeling can be understood not merely as a shift in representation-from whole foods to foods as nutrients-but more broadly as a retooling of food markets to embed notions about personal responsibility for health into the ways that food was designed, marketed, and consumed.",

    "abstract": "Guglielmo Marconi's trans-Atlantic wireless experiment in 1900 marked the beginning of a communication revolution that transformed the open space above the earth into channels of information flow. This dissertation grapples with the historical conditions that gave rise to such a transformation: the studies of radio-wave propagation and the treatments of radio interferences in early twentieth-century America and Western Europe. The part on propagation examines the debate between the surface diffraction theory and the atmospheric reflection theory for long waves, the development of the ionic refraction theory for short waves, the evidential quests for the existence of the ionosphere, and the studies of the geomagnetic effects on propagation. The part on interferences focuses on the engineering efforts toward the characterization of atmospheric noise and signal-intensity fluctuations, the policies of radio-channel allocation for fighting man-made interference, and the scientific research into electronic tube noise. By the mid-30s, the results from these endeavors had considerably improved the quality of radio communication. Characterizing Radio Channels builds a bridge between the history of science and the history of technology by inspecting an immaterial engineering entity--radio channels--whose control required significant scientific research. In the history of science, it contributes to an integrated study of electrical physics and geophysics. In the history of technology, it enriches radio history, epistemology of engineering knowledge, consumer studies, and the studies of technological policies.

    "text": "Characterizing radio channels : the science and technology of propagation and interference, 1900-1935 Guglielmo Marconi's trans-Atlantic wireless experiment in 1900 marked the beginning of a communication revolution that transformed the open space above the earth into channels of information flow. This dissertation grapples with the historical conditions that gave rise to such a transformation: the studies of radio-wave propagation and the treatments of radio interferences in early twentieth-century America and Western Europe. The part on propagation examines the debate between the surface diffraction theory and the atmospheric reflection theory for long waves, the development of the ionic refraction theory for short waves, the evidential quests for the existence of the ionosphere, and the studies of the geomagnetic effects on propagation. The part on interferences focuses on the engineering efforts toward the characterization of atmospheric noise and signal-intensity fluctuations, the policies of radio-channel allocation for fighting man-made interference, and the scientific research into electronic tube noise. By the mid-30s, the results from these endeavors had considerably improved the quality of radio communication. Characterizing Radio Channels builds a bridge between the history of science and the history of technology by inspecting an immaterial engineering entity--radio channels--whose control required significant scientific research. In the history of science, it contributes to an integrated study of electrical physics and geophysics. In the history of technology, it enriches radio history, epistemology of engineering knowledge, consumer studies, and the studies of technological policies. Combining both fields with the concept of radio channels enables a new understanding of the historical conditions that made the information society"

    "title": "The wired wilderness : electronic surveillance and environmental values in wildlife biology",
    "abstract": "In the second half of the twentieth century, American wildlife biologists incorporated Cold War-era surveillance technologies into their practices in order to render wild animals and their habitats legible and manageable. One of the most important of these was wildlife radio-tracking, in which collars and tags containing miniature transmitters were used to locate individual animals in the field. In addition to producing new ecological insights, radio-tracking served as a site where relationships among scientists, animals, hunters, animal rights activists, environmentalists, and others involved in wildlife conservation could be embodied and contested. While scholars have tended to interpret surveillance technologies in terms of the extension of human control over nature and society, I show how technological, biological, and ecological factors made such control fragmentary and open to reappropriation. Wildlife radio-tracking created vulnerabilities as well as capabilities; it provided opportunities for connection as well as for control. I begin by showing how biologists in Minnesota and Illinois in the early 1960s used radio-tracking to establish intimate, technologically-mediated, situated relationships with game animals such as ruffed grouse, which they hoped would bolster their authority vis-a-vis recreational hunters. I then show how the technique was contested by environmentalists when biologists applied it to iconic \"wilderness wildlife\" such as grizzly bears in Yellowstone National Park in the 1960s and 1970s. One way for biologists to render radio-tracking acceptable in the face of such opposition was to emphasize its continuity with traditional practices, as they did in a radio-tagging study of tigers in Nepal in the 1970s.",

    "abstract": "Through the mode of conceptual history, this dissertation examines some of the forms dissent could take within academic social science in the United States from roughly 1945-1970. The concept in question is \"conflict.\" There are many stories one could tell about this concept and its transformations in postwar American social science, but in this dissertation I focus on one in particular: how certain social scientists sought to frame conflict as a problem of knowledge, by stretching the concept to fit the global proportions of the bipolar world that seemed to have emerged from World War II, and then using that conceptualization to oppose the Cold War. The dissertation first considers a specific moment of conceptual change, when some social scientists sought to redefine \"conflict\" in the immediate aftermath of World War II, so that it would be capacious enough to describe conflict at all levels of analysis, from the intrapersonal to the international. From there, it follows a cadre of social scientists who used that novel conceptualization to build an intellectual movement around a new journal and research center starting in the mid- 1950s. The scholars who participated in that movement, known as \"peace research\" or ''conflict resolution,\" endeavored to construct a \"general theory of conflict,\" which they would then employ to challenge the notion that the Cold War was inevitable. The language of mid-century social science was the idiom in which they expressed their dissent. Although this was to become an international movement, this dissertation focuses on its American incarnation, which came to fruition at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor beginning around 1957. The dissertation then looks closely at how two of the leading theorists of that movement modeled conflict in the early 1960s, and considers the ethical and political impulses that animated their work, demonstrating that it was possible for some intellectuals to inhabit the dual role of academic social scientist and social critic in the early 1960s. It concludes with a brief set of reflections on the United States Institute of Peace, an independent federal institute established in 1984 to embody the dream of \"conflict resolution.\"",

It discusses how the technological objects being created privilege the body as a dynamic and interactive system, in contrast to the description and taxonomic body of traditional anatomy and medicine. It describes the ways that these technologies create new sensory means of knowing bodies. And it discusses the larger cultural values that these technologies reify or challenge. The methodology of this dissertation is ethnography. I consider in-depth one laboratory at a major medical school, as well as other laboratories and researchers in the field of virtual medicine. I study actors in the emerging field of virtual medicine as they work in laboratories, at conferences, and in collaborations with one another. I consider the social formations that are developing with this new discipline. Methods include participant observation of laboratory activities, teaching, surgery, and conferences and extensive, in-depth interviewing of actors in the field.

Specifically this dissertation explores the role of direct-to-consumer drug marketing (DTC) in the consumption and experience of antidepressants, including a cultural shift in the U.S. towards how the consumer negotiates new ethical injunctions to manage his or her own identity through pharmaceuticals. A key focus is how marketers carve out their own ethical niche from which they innovate on ways to persuade consumer audiences with scientific facts that double as public relations. This dissertation gives special attention to how individuals encounter and incorporate the putative neuroscience of DTC advertising of antidepressants to negotiate their personal knowledge of illness, and to manage their identity, everyday practices, and professional pursuits. From these ethnographic encounters I have identified \"illness,\" \"fantasy,\" and \"capital\" as three key themes for my analysis of DTC marketing.

    "abstract": "This dissertation tracks what happens when biology, that is, both life forms and knowledge about them, becomes the object of security. While increasing global traffic has led to a greater degree of movement of people, animals, plants, and microbes, biosecurity measures are concerned with regulating circulation and seek to work against such possibly homogenizing forces by both documenting and maintaining the distinctiveness of life forms in different places. Through ethnographic research in Mexico, I track the social logics, scientific practices, and institutional forms that underwrite biosecurity in three areas: invasive species control, emerging infectious disease research, and the use of transgenic organisms. I examine how conservationists working in Mexican settings - particularly on islands - alternately protect or exterminate the various life forms they encounter; how microbiologists and immunologists studying infectious diseases in Mexico make claims about the relationships between environments, bodies, and viral ecologies; and how ecologists regulate the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and turn them into bureaucratic objects. All these projects entail defining \"native\" life forms and establishing what is unique and valuable about Mexican biology. By bringing together this assortment of interlocutors and research sites I map how biosecurity projects establish the ways that a shared biological substantiality connects the nation and how human and non-human life forms are incorporated into political identities. Through these projects scientists produce knowledge about Mexican biology (including who or what is included or excluded in these populations). As this knowledge in turn informs political efforts to improve human and ecological health, biosecurity projects become ways in which science and the nation in Mexico are coconstituted. I address the production of biosecurity in two canonical places of science, the lab and the field, and I argue for the importance of a third scientific space, the office, a space where scientists engaged with bureaucratic processes and shaped the administration of Mexican ecosystems. Further, I argue that in Mexico biopolitics and biosecurity are no longer only about the regulation of human life, but have been extended beyond the human to encompass animal, plant, and microbial worlds. Mexican biopolitics have become multispecies projects.",

    "title": "Animal madness : a natural history of disorder",
    "abstract": "Beginning in the late 19 th century, changing conceptions of relatedness between people and other animals -- and animals' assumed capacities for, or susceptibilities to, mental or emotional distress-- were influenced by debates over what it meant to be both human and sane in Britain and the United States. Through a historical, partly-ethnographic, investigation of animal insanity in various times and places in the Anglo-American world from the late I 9 th century through the early 21st, I argue that identifying animal madness, insanity, nervous disorders, anxiety disorders, phobias, depression, obsessive compulsivities, suicidal behaviors and more, has not only served as a way of affixing meaning to puzzling animal acts, but has been used to denote borders (or lack thereof) between certain groups of humans and certain groups of animals. As with other divisions, such as those hinging on race, gender, nationality or class, ideas surrounding which humans and which other animals could experience particular forms of insanity have been used to justify certain forms of treatment (or mistreatment), to rationalize needs for confinement or freedom, or to determine what sorts of people and other creatures were deserving of rights and to what degree. I suggest that the history of attempts to identify certain emotional phenomena such as melancholy and suicidal behavior in horses and monkeys, to, more recently, obsessive-compulsivity in parrots and PTSD in military dogs, demonstrates that other animals have acted as mirrors and proxies for disordered Anglo-American minds for more than a century.

    "text": "Animal madness : a natural history of disorder Beginning in the late 19 th century, changing conceptions of relatedness between people and other animals -- and animals' assumed capacities for, or susceptibilities to, mental or emotional distress-- were influenced by debates over what it meant to be both human and sane in Britain and the United States. Through a historical, partly-ethnographic, investigation of animal insanity in various times and places in the Anglo-American world from the late I 9 th century through the early 21st, I argue that identifying animal madness, insanity, nervous disorders, anxiety disorders, phobias, depression, obsessive compulsivities, suicidal behaviors and more, has not only served as a way of affixing meaning to puzzling animal acts, but has been used to denote borders (or lack thereof) between certain groups of humans and certain groups of animals. As with other divisions, such as those hinging on race, gender, nationality or class, ideas surrounding which humans and which other animals could experience particular forms of insanity have been used to justify certain forms of treatment (or mistreatment), to rationalize needs for confinement or freedom, or to determine what sorts of people and other creatures were deserving of rights and to what degree. I suggest that the history of attempts to identify certain emotional phenomena such as melancholy and suicidal behavior in horses and monkeys, to, more recently, obsessive-compulsivity in parrots and PTSD in military dogs, demonstrates that other animals have acted as mirrors and proxies for disordered Anglo-American minds for more than a century. Drawing upon archival sources, published literature in the fields of ethology, psychology, psychiatry, psychopharmacology, and the veterinary sciences, as well as environmental history, history of medicine and animal studies, combined with interviews and participant observation, I argue that attempts to locate insanity, mental illness, dysfunction and \"normalcy\" among nonhumans has had wide-ranging effects on diagnostic and therapeutic practices in humans and other animals alike in the United States and Britain."

It consists of three case studies from the Chilcotin Plateau in the west-central part of present-day British Columbia.

As different groups struggled to control the fate of the region and its resources, they invoked very different understandings of its past, understandings based in part on the material traces that they found there.

The opening chapters of the dissertation examine two experimental institutions - an independent forest ecology research center in Smithers, B.C., and a defunct GIS analysis team based on a nearby Gitxsan reserve - to examine how rural scenes of collaboration complicate the modalities of influence and organizational coherency often attributed to professional scientific networks.

The concluding chapter examine the agencies of archives and simulations produced by two separate long-term forestry modeling groups.

    "abstract": "This dissertation explores how body maps served as a site for theoretical, experimental, and cultural entanglements between \"Chinese medicine\" and \"biomedicine.\" It explores how body atlases produced under varying social and cultural conditions involved similar ontological questions with diverging social and cultural implications. These ontological questions set into motion disparate theories about the body that continue to destabilize contemporary medical practice. I explore the fate of maps that medical practitioners in China and Britain traced on paper and on people. Rather than representing what could be directly observed, these maps made visible what could be felt. Body maps offer a unique approach to transnational histories of science and medicine because they existed as meticulously crafted artifacts of visual perception and material evidence that carried social and political currency. In particular, I follow how Chinese physiologists re-presented meridian paths for acupuncture moxibustion practice and the conceptual friction that these maps introduced once they were compared with sensation maps that British neurologists produced to identify peripheral nerve clusters and distinct areas of pain. Amidst state-building efforts in the early twentieth century, medical practitioners in China reproduced meridian maps to emphasize the technical and systematic virtues of acupuncture moxibustion. Yet, meridian maps presented an ontological problem, as standardizing its paths required fixing locations along courses that shifted in living bodies. This dissertation picks up where political historians leave off, examining transformations in medical theory and tracking how individuals concerned with constructing the legacy of medicine in China eventually came to resurrect abandoned neurophysiological maps produced in late nineteenth century Britain. Through a careful excavation of image and text, I demonstrate how efforts to locate shifting areas on the surface of the body conflicted and cohered with discourses of science. I argue that \"intimate cartographies,\" or maps based on individual encounters of the body, challenged standards of visualizing and describing unseen physiological systems.

    "abstract": "This dissertation examines how Americans have transformed the environment through the construction of new technologies and the roles of technical professionals in bringing about these changes. In the twentieth century, federal engineers, working with local Western boosters and their federal superiors, transformed the West's waterscape. Between 1900 and 1970, engineers of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation--only one of three federal agencies that built dams-constructed over 400. On the Columbia River alone, federal engineers constructed thirteen large dams that turned the nation's fourth largest river into a chain of lakes. Engineers wrought this transformation with multiple purpose dams-a new style of dam building in the twentieth century. This style combined a new way of understanding how dams should be used with new approaches to financing the construction of dams and to designing and siting dam structures. Engineers built dams that developed water resources for multiple uses: navigation, flood control, irrigation, and hydroelectricity production. They financed these dams by allocating the costs among uses and then obtaining funds either through federal grants (for navigation and flood control) or loans (for irrigation and hydroelectricity). Engineers frequently designed these dams as traditional concrete gravity structures and sited them at prime locations on major rivers. This work examines the rise of the multiple purpose style of dam building through the history of Grand Coulee Dam. Located on the Columbia River in Washington State, Grand Coulee Dam is one in a group of large dams planned in the 1920s and built in the 1930s during whose design and construction federal engineers worked out this new style of building. It shows that engineers came to prefer this style because it fulfilled conservationists' hopes for \"comprehensive planning\" of water resources and it eliminated financial problems with federal irrigation activities. Engineers alone did not launch this building program: local constituencies favored development and Franklin Roosevelt's new administration supported relief projects, conservation programs, and government involvement in the electrical industry. Working together, these three groups built a political coalition for multiple purpose dams that successfully underpinned expanded building.",

Three astronauts lost their lives in 1967, and in each Shuttle accident seven astronauts were killed. Following each of these fatal accidents, a significant investigation was conducted and a comprehensive investigation report produced. These investigation reports each served to create public narratives of the reasons for the accidents.

This thesis re-examines the evidence produced to investigate and explain each accident. By analyzing the investigation reports critically, as well as reviewing the accidents themselves, this work considers how engineering cultures and practices at NASA shifted to meet the changing demands of the space program. It argues that the public narratives of the accidents are not completely congruent with the engineering evidence, and that these very selective narratives are influential in shaping future strengths (and weaknesses) at NASA.

    "abstract": "This study examines the assemblage of scientific knowledge, engineering practices, measuring instruments, and civilian and military institutions in the U.S. and Japan that went into the construction of the machine operator as a historically situated category of person in the midtwentieth century. Over the three decades from 1930 to 1960, American psychologists, physiologists, anthropologists, and engineers produced a large body of knowledge, instruments, and techniques with which to understand, select, and train aircraft pilots. The figure of the pilot thus constructed was less of a \"flier\" engaged in speedy movements and adventures than of an \"operator\" with disciplined attention and posture. The conditions that constituted the aircraft operator were multifarious: spatial, virtual, psychological, anthropometrical, political, and cultural. I first examine the Link Trainer, a ground-based flight trainer, and explore how the meaning of \"flying\" shifted with the use of instrument flying technique and the experience of simulated training on the ground. Then I show how psychologists redefined flying from a problem of movement to a problem of attention in their research on pilot selection tests, especially by contrasting the validity of physiological tests and psychomotor tests. Concurrently, physical anthropologists were articulating two different ways of relating the pilot's body to flying; one was the correlation between physique and one's success as a pilot and the other was the dimensional configuration of the body in the space of the cockpit. In postwar Japan, this American notion of the pilot served as the model for Japanese pilots, who embraced American norms and conventions for flying after a long ban on aviation. Even the bodies of Japanese pilots were measured and compared with those of Americans. As the scientists and engineers in postwar America extended wartime knowledge and techniques to study various situations of machine operation, aircraft pilots also came to stand for human individuals more generally, forming the conceptual basis of human factors engineering or ergonomics. Through this expansion and generalization of the pilot, a particular type of human-the one who operates machines through displays and controls-came into being as an object of study and control.",

    "abstract": "This dissertation explores the relationship between types of livestock and place in the context of Great Britain's expanding agro-pastoral empire. Specifically, it examines how the distribution and circulation of breeds of livestock native to the British Isles influenced understandings of kind and location-of the dynamic interaction between heredity, human influence and environmental conditions, and their various fluid effects on ovine and bovine diversity. Drawing on extensive archival work in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia, I trace both the national origins and imperial expansion of British breeds. As Britain industrialized in the early nineteenth century, breeders faced the need to convert the specificity of their animals into fungibility while maintaining the distinctive character of their breeds, seemingly incompatible aims that nonetheless guaranteed the economic viability of their stock. Thus they reoriented local variability towards market standardization, transforming regional types of cattle and sheep into geographically transposable, bulky, and quick-fattening beasts suited for increasingly sophisticated economies and industrialized production. Tension between standardization and specialization shaped the dispersal of breeds throughout the empire as well. Here, stockbreeders served two masters: the unfamiliar climates and topographies of Australia, New Zealand, and North America, which demanded local adaptations, and the British consumer, whose dinner table was the end of the line for the bulk of colonial beef and mutton. As they tried to balance local adaptation and metropolitan taste, breeders experimented with heredity, testing the limits of contemporary understandings of heritability and breed plasticity, and developed of new strains of livestock genetically derived from British breeds, but culturally, economically and environmentally hybrid. In the process, imperialism itself was instantiated in these animals. Bodies of sheep and cattle were remade to suit new lands and later to fill the refrigerated holds of ocean liners. The empire itself was recast as a vast apparatus for feeding Britons. This system, divested of its imperial trappings and disseminated still further, brings meat to tables around the world today.",

    "abstract": "This dissertation argues that Chile's history of computing is tightly interwoven with the history of the Chilean state. It begins by documenting the government use of mechanical tabulating machines during the 1920s and 1930s and concludes with the disbanding of the state computer enterprise known as ECOM in 1991. The dissertation pays particular attention to the period between 1964 and 1973, which was marked by the presidencies of Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei Montalva and Socialist Salvador Allende Gossens. The dissertation addresses three central questions. First, it asks how Chilean economic policies and political events shaped the country's technological history. Second, it asks what we can learn from computers if we treat them as texts for understanding historical processes in Chile, the Latin American region, and the developing world. Finally, it addresses how Chile's political leaders used computing machines in their attempts to control Chile's social, economic, and political development and to forward their plans to modernize the Chilean nation. It argues that computers proved valuable not only in producing the Chile of today but in articulating national goals that changed over time.",

    "abstract": "This study of the changing practices and perceptions of prediction in the late nineteenth century reveals the process by which Americans came to rationalize economic and cultural uncertainty into modern life. Forecasts of all kinds were ubiquitous in the late nineteenth century; as the United States fashioned itself into an urban-industrial power with a national economy and an increasingly corporate and bureaucratic society, prediction became an increasingly significant scientific, economic, and cultural practice. As a postbellum crisis of certainty destabilized ways of thinking about the future-in science, social science, and religion-predictions, whether accurate or not, offered illusions of control over one's future to citizens of a rapidly modernizing America. I argue that the late-century search for predictability found as much uncertainty as it did certainty, that consumers of predictions were at once desirous and dismissive of forecasts that often took on greater cultural than economic value, and that producers and consumers of prediction together rationalized uncertainty and shaped a new cultural acceptance of the predictable unpredictability of modern life. In the first half of the dissertation I analyze the work of U.S. Department of Agriculture statisticians, private cotton estimators, Weather Bureau forecasters, and local \"weather prophets,\" all of whom sought to systematically convert their observations into economically valuable predictions.

Although scientists have been experimenting with tDCS in both healthy and clinical populations for the last fifteen years, in late 2011 a movement arose wherein \"lay\" individuals began constructing their own tDCS devices, or purchasing consumer devices, to stimulate their brains outside of academic or medical settings for self-improvement purposes. Not surprisingly, the lay use of tDCS has not been well received by researchers, who have termed it \"fringe\" or \"unorthodox.\" This work studies the conflict over tDCS: what is tDCS, who gets to use it, and who studies it? What are the multiple social worlds that tDCS inhabits, how is the technology interpreted and utilized in each, and how does each group authorize or discredit the other's use? My dissertation incorporates interviews, observations, an online survey, archival research, and legal analyses to probe aspects of the controversy from different angles. The first chapter introduces tDCS technology and chronicles the rise of the do-it-yourself movement and the subsequent emergence of direct-to-consumer devices. In the second chapter, I present an in-depth qualitative study of the practices of home users of tDCS; the third chapter offers a quantitative look at those who have purchased a consumer tDCS device, based on the results of an online survey. The fourth chapter addresses regulatory issues surrounding consumer tDCS devices, providing a comprehensive analysis of relevant legal doctrines and laws. The fifth chapter covers historical precedents for the home use of electrical stimulation, with a focus on uses of the medical battery between 1870 and 1920 in the United States. In the sixth chapter, I compare the medical battery to tDCS, arguing that the controversy over the home use of tDCS is not novel or even surprising, but rather the latest wave in a series of ongoing attempts by lay individuals to utilize electricity for therapeutic purposes.",

    "abstract": "This dissertation examines the distinctive and critical role that space exploration played in American foreign relations and national image making in the 1960s. Proposed by President John F. Kennedy in 1961, Project Apollo was established, in large part, as a means of demonstrating American power and promoting technocratic values in an international landscape defined by the Cold War, the collapse of colonialism, and the emergence of newly independent nations. While existing scholarship has gestured to this geopolitical context, it has tended to examine activity that takes place on American or lunar soil. This dissertation argues that the geopolitical context was not simply a backdrop but instead the main theater of Project Apollo. By embedding this familiar story back in its global context, this dissertation reinterprets the established narrative of Project Apollo in three significant ways. First, it places greater emphasis on the international stage and the relationship between the US and the world. Second, while the role of the Executive Branch remains essential to this story, this dissertation shifts the focus from engineers and managers, to key actors within the State Department and United States Information Agency, as well as foreign leaders and the world public. Finally, the role of Project Apollo in foreign relations, and public diplomacy in particular, becomes the defining feature of this investigation. By examining how US government elites promoted and disseminated information about space exploration to support American foreign relations interests, this dissertation offers a lens onto attempts to establish national power by fusing perceived values and strengths of science and technology- like rationality and progress- with the image of the nation's political system. These efforts, this dissertation demonstrates, were not only aimed at boosting American prestige, but were also strategic attempts to promote an idea of global unity and progress ushered in by American scientific and technological leadership.",

    "abstract": "This ethnography tracks a diverse set of practices I term \"constructive biologies,\" by which I mean efforts in the post-genomic life sciences to understand how biology works by making new biological things. I examine five fields of constructive biology - synthetic biology, DIY (do-it-yourself) biology, hyperbolic crochet, sonocytology, and molecular gastronomy - investigating how they are enmeshed in sensory engagements that employ craftwork as a means of grasping biology. Synthetic biology is a community of bioengineers who aim to fabricate standardized biological systems using genetic components and manufacturing principles borrowed from engineering. DIY biology is a community of \"biohackers\" who appropriate synthetic biologists' terminologies, standards, and commitment to freely exchanging biomaterials in order to do hobbyist biological engineering in their homes. The Hyperbolic Crochet Coral Reef is a distributed venture of thousands of women who are cooperatively fabricating a series of yarn and plastic coral reefs in order to build a material simulation of oceanic morphologies and evolutionary theories. Sonocytology, a technique in nanotechnology research, uses scanning probe microscopes to \"listen to\" cellular vibrations and \"feel\" the topologies of cells and cellular components. Molecular gastronomy is a movement in which practitioners - physical chemists and biochemists who study food, and chefs who apply their results - use biochemical principles and laboratory apparatuses to further cooking and the culinary arts. In analyzing these fields, I draw on histories of experimental biology, anthropological accounts of artisanship, science studies work on embodiment and tacit knowledge in scientific practice, and sensory ethnography. Based on data gathered from participant-observation and interviewing, I argue for thinking about making new biological things as a form of \"crafting,\" an analytic that illuminates five aspects of contemporary biological manufacture: 1) sensory cultivation, 2) ongoing participation with biological media and forms, 3) the integration of making biological things and practitioners' selfmaking, 4) the embedding of social relations, interests, norms, and modes of exchange in built artifacts, and 5) the combination of making and knowing.

I argue that the anti-trafficking network consolidates expertise through a shared moralizing politics of bureaucracy and carceral sensibility of securitization. This network mobilizes the issue of child protection to expand the reach of technologies of search and prediction, and to afford legitimation to a newly normalized level of digital surveillance. My findings are based on three years of ethnographic fieldwork and interviews with the United Nations and anti-trafficking organizations in Thailand, with a child protection NGO and police in the Netherlands, and with software companies and law enforcement in the United States. I use two case studies to support my argument that the child protection movement has motivated the expansion of digital policing and surveillance: 1) image detection software developed in collaboration between social media and software companies and international law enforcement organizations; and 2) the design and deployment of a 3D moving avatar of a photorealistic girl used in a child sex exploitation sting operation by an NGO working with an advertising firm. I draw from queer feminist phenomenology to introduce 'proximity' as a governing concept for understanding expert sociality and digital surveillance. Child protection operates in a global affective economy of fear, in which the risk of violence is always anticipated and close. The new global policing network keeps exploitation proximate through the humanitarian ideology of emancipation that motivates child protection, and through publicity of technological campaigns, in order to produce public acquiescence to the spectacles of digital surveillance, shaming, and punishment.",

    "abstract": "Natural gas extraction in the United States in the early 21st century has transformed social, physical, legal and biological landscapes. The technique of hydraulic fracturing, which entails the high-pressure injection into subsurface shale formations of synthetic chemical mixtures, has been viewed by the natural gas industry as a practice of great promise. But there is another side to the story. The first half of this dissertation explores an innovative scientific approach to studying the possible deleterious impacts on human health and the environment of the release of chemicals used in gas extraction. Via participant-observation within a small scientific advocacy organization, The Endocrine Disruption Exchange (TEDX), I follow the development of a database of chemicals used in natural gas extraction, a database that seeks to document not only what these chemicals are (many are proprietary), but also what sorts of bodily and ecological effects these substances may have. I analyze ethnographically how TEDX transformed an information vacuum around fracturing and generated fierce regional and national debates about the public health effects of this activity. The second portion of the dissertation expands TEDX's databasing methodology by reporting on a set of online user-generated databasing and mapping tools developed to interconnect communities encountering the corporate forces and chemical processes animating gas development. Shale gas extraction is an intensive technological practice and requires the delicate calibration of corporate, governmental, and legal apparatuses in order to proceed. The industry operates at county, state, and federal levels, and has in many instances been able to organize regulatory environments suited to rapid and lucrative gas extraction. In the midst of such multi-scalar deterritorializing forces, communities may have little legal or technical recourse if they think that they have been subject to chemical and corporate forces that undermine their financial, bodily, and social security. ExtrAct, a research group I co-founded and directed with artist and technologist Chris Csikszentmihalyi, sought to intervene in these processes by developing a suite of online mapping and databasing tools through which \"gas patch\" communities could share information, network, study and respond to industry activity across states. Using ExtrAct as an example this dissertation explores how social sciences and the academy at large can invest in developing research tools, methods, and programs designed for non-corporate ends, perhaps redressing in the process the informational and technical imbalances faced by communities dealing with large-scale multinational industries whose infrastructure and impacts are largely invisible to public scrutiny. The dissertation describes one potential method for such engaged scientific and social scientific research: an iterative, ethnographically informed process that I term \"STS in Practice.\"",

ExtrAct, a research group I co-founded and directed with artist and technologist Chris Csikszentmihalyi, sought to intervene in these processes by developing a suite of online mapping and databasing tools through which \"gas patch\" communities could share information, network, study and respond to industry activity across states. Using ExtrAct as an example this dissertation explores how social sciences and the academy at large can invest in developing research tools, methods, and programs designed for non-corporate ends, perhaps redressing in the process the informational and technical imbalances faced by communities dealing with large-scale multinational industries whose infrastructure and impacts are largely invisible to public scrutiny. The dissertation describes one potential method for such engaged scientific and social scientific research: an iterative, ethnographically informed process that I term \"STS in Practice.\""

    "abstract": "This dissertation presents a history of the community of nuclear arms control experts in the United States during the middle and later years of the Cold War, the age of thermonuclear ballistic missiles. Arms control experts were, in many interesting ways, both insiders and outsiders to the American \"nuclear state.\" The dissertation begins by exploring the formation of strategic arms control in the years leading up to 1960, showing how arms control emerged from the mixing of local communities of disarmament advocates and theorists of nuclear deterrence. Rather than inevitable doctrinal unity, early arms control was highly local and contingent. In particular, the crucial concept of \"stability\" was open to multiple interpretations. In the 1960s, arms control problems motivated groundbreaking scientific research. Elite contract consultants to the government contemplated the use of lasers as weapons against ballistic missiles. As consultants performed calculations and experiments in the context of classified discussions and studies, they founded a new field of physics called nonlinear optics. In the late 1960s, strategic arms control became a public issue during a complex political dispute over missile defense. Arms control experts mediated and fueled this controversy by participating in a surprising range of activity, rallying alongside local residents whose neighborhoods would be impacted by missile defense installations, and criticizing defense policy in Congressional testimony-even as they worked their connections to the White House. In the 1960s and 1970s arms controllers shaped a changing institutional landscape for the support of arms control expertise. They built arms control into a new government agency, and later drew on the resources of philanthropic foundations to create major university arms control centers. By the 1980s, arms control reached peak public visibility amid controversy over the Reagan administration's Strategic Defense Initiative. This dissertation uses the private papers and correspondence of numerous experts, a wide range of arms control publications, and government records to explore the diverse practices of arms control. It engages a wider discussion among historians about the status of Cold War elites, the relationship between experts and the American state, and the character of scientific knowledge during the Cold War.",

    "abstract": "This dissertation concerns the role of place in scientific practice. Ideas of place, I argue, shape and are shaped by science. I specifically look at the community of planetary scientists who, though they cannot step foot on the objects they study, transform planets into places. This is an ethnographic work that draws on 18 months of fieldwork during which time I encountered several different communities of planetary scientists. At MIT, I worked alongside astronomers looking for planets around other stars. These \"exoplanet\" astronomers transformed numerical counts of photons into complex worlds with atmospheres and weather. Data visualizations characterized the work of a community learning to see unseen planets in specific, place-based ways. I also traveled with an astronomer to a Chilean observatory where she studied the night sky hoping to find a \"habitable planet.\" Many other astronomers share this goal and have designed various ways to detect a planet like Earth. The importance of these projects signifies that exoplanet astronomers are more interested in finding planetary kin - planets that are familiar places - than exotic aliens. To determine how the planetary places created by exoplanet astronomers differ from those in our own Solar System, I spent time at the NASA Ames Research Center with a group of computer scientists who create high resolution and three-dimensional maps of Mars. These maps reflect the kind of place Mars is today: it is available to everyone to explore, it is displayed such that you can imagine standing on the surface, and it is presented as geologically dynamic in ways similar to Earth. Even though these maps help give Mars a sense of place, Martian science is still stymied by the inability to send humans to its surface. Instead, planetary scientists travel to terrestrial sites deemed to be \"Mars-like\" to approximate performing geologic fieldwork on Mars. I went to one of these locations to see how, during these outings, Mars and Earth become entwined as scientists forge connections between two planetary places. These diverse scientific activities, I conclude, are transforming our view of the cosmos. Outer space is becoming outer place.",

    "abstract": "\"Negotiating Nature\" explores resource management in action and the intertwined roles of law and science in environmental conflicts in the Upper Klamath River Basin in southern Oregon. I follow disputes over the management of water and endangered species. I develop several themes: first, how these disputes demonstrate the growing connections between scientific and legal authority in environmental matters. This occurs because environmental laws often limit participation in disputes to those who can offer \"scientific data\" in support of their claims. I call this situation \"scientific legality\" and suggest that increasingly, one's ability to make legal claims is closely tied to one's ability to muster scientific authority behind those claims. Second, how the growing importance of scientific expertise in environmental decision-making has affected the ways that groups frame environmental claims. Third, how negotiations over environmental rights, regulations, and policies shape not only management efforts, but also narratives of environmental relationships. In Part One, I discuss the Endangered Species Act of 1973, which legally mandates that only scientific considerations can be taken into account in certain aspects of endangered species management. As a result, the Act has impacted the ways people frame claims about endangered species. I then discuss how the Klamath Tribes of American Indians have responded this situation, and the implications of this for presumed divisions between the environmental knowledge of scientists and native peoples. In Part Two, I examine a 1975 water rights case, United States v. Adair et al. I explore how the court drew on and reproduced prominent narratives of American Indian history, and the ways these narratives bounded the agency of the Klamath in relation to the environment and the colonial process. In Part Three, I examine a dispute in 2001 over endangered species. In this conflict, a dispute over policy quickly became a dispute over the scientific claims that legitimated the policy. Expert disagreement ensued. Although political explanations for expert disagreement were common, I suggest that a more underlying cause was the unavoidable uncertainties of ecological claims.

    "abstract": "This dissertation examines the mutually reinforcing connections between science and law and their construction of pain in British regulation of animal experimentation. It investigates the Home Office's implementation of the Cruelty to Animals Act (1876), the first effort anywhere in the world to impose legal restrictions on vivisection, during the three decades following its enactment. The study ends in 1912 with the findings of a second Royal Commission that evaluated the workings of the Act. The Commission reaffirmed many of the Home Office polices regarding vivisection and their underlying premises. The Act mandated official supervision of scientific experiments that \"calculated to give pain\" to animal subjects. Implementing the Act therefore necessitated the identification and quantification of pain. This requirement created what I term the \"bureaucracy of empathy,\" an attempt to systemize the understanding of animal suffering through administrative mechanisms. Practicing empathy was integral to some bureaucratic tasks, for example, attaching the right certificate to an inoculation experiment. Additionally, various factors including legal settings and scientific knowledge informed and situated this empathy with animals, when, for instance, an inspector drafted a report about mutilated monkeys while visiting a physiology laboratory. My analysis unravels that defining animal pain was often intertwined with the definition of an experiment. Law and science co-constitution of pain and experiments conditioned both the daily work of administering the law and the practices of experimenters. This dynamic led to the adoption of technologies such as anesthesia and pain scoring models, which provided legal-medical means to control pain in research and to ostensibly create a cruelty free experimental fact. A new pain-based ethical order was established, designed by law officers, civil servants, and court judges as much as by physiologists, remaking the relationships between experimenters, state representatives, and laboratory animals.",

    "abstract": "Pocket computers, called \"smartphones,\" have become a part of everyday life over the past decade. Most people now routinely carry around with them millions of times more computing power than generated the Apollo mission to the Moon. They use it to access, process, and share information quickly and cheaply, in furtherance of the things people have long done: buying and selling, socializing, and so on, yet faster and across greater distances-characteristic of what we call \"modernity.\" This has affected the ways in which people are working, and who is working, doing what, today. This thesis reports the results of a field study of one new kind of laborer who has been brought into work consequent to the smartphone: Uber drivers. The author conducted ethnographic fieldwork over one year in Boston, Massachusetts, and the surrounding area using ride-along sampling, participant observation, lengthy interviewing, and systematic coding in order to better understand a software-organized, person-to-person labor market in which the person who does the labor also brings the capital in the form of a vehicle used to provide transportation to other people. The first chapter of the thesis provides a typology of Uber drivers based on semi-random sampling through ride-alongs. The second chapter describes collective action that was undertaken by Uber drivers at Boston's Logan Airport in the form of a strike against the algorithm, which was an effort to induce the software to perceive an (artificial) driver shortage, leading to an increase in the price of fares. The third chapter offers a theory of the structure of Uber as an organization that mobilizes labor by using software to facilitate economic transactions that are triangulated between two users and the firm. The chapter also explains how this structure was particularly apt at mobilizing large numbers of people to carry out \"regulatory breach,\" as they worked as Uber drivers doing the equivalent of taxi or livery work without complying with any of the applicable legal regulations. The final chapter explains how analysis of the field data, in combination with the new theoretical insights of the thesis, drives a conclusion suggested by the thesis title: that Uber has made a digital working class.",

    "abstract": "This dissertation examines the history of shark-human interactions in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. It argues that the mid-twentieth century onward saw a series of conjunctures -technological, cultural, and scientific -that thrust sharks and humans into unprecedented levels of contact. This led to both a rise in preoccupation with sharks, and an emergence of new stakeholder groups that sought produce knowledge about them. The conflicting definitions, attitudes, and responses to sharks presented by these various groups are linked to greater trends in science, culture, and society. In particular, the way humans write and think about sharks and other man-eating predators has deep links to the position we see ourselves occupying in the environment. Further, anxieties about sharks are strongly tied to the complicated cultural relationships that people have with the marine environment, both as a place of wonder and terror. Lastly, sharks also allow us to examine the technologies we use to tame and navigate the ocean, as the shifts that brought humans and sharks into closer proximity were intertwined with new technologies that changed the ways humans interacted with marine spaces. Each chapter presents case studies from the United States and South Africa, juxtaposing the responses by each region. The opening chapter charts the rise of shark attack numbers in the mid-century. It traces the impact of highly publicized shark attacks in the U.S. and South Africa in the 1950s, which resulted in differing approaches to combat the threat of shark attack. Chapter Two explores the intersections between popular depictions of sharks and changing perceptions of shark behavior, centering on the ur-text of shark literature: Jaws. Chapter Three traces the advent of shark tourism, and examines the controversy surrounding white shark cage diving in South Africa. Chapter Four explores the response of Cape Cod communities to an influx of white sharks into the region, drawing parallels with earlier historical examples of predator eradication and conservation. The dissertation thus argues that studying shark-human interactions allows for the interrogation of divisions between myth and science, experts and laypersons, popular culture and scientific knowledge, humans and the environment.",

    "title": "Economy electric : techno-economics, neoliberalism, and electricity in the United States",
    "abstract": "This dissertation is a study of emergent economic forms of life. It investigates recent remakings of economic existence and modes of disseminating these forms of life, and does so with particular reference to the crafting of electricity markets in the United States. It draws on more than a year of fieldwork among experts and users involved in electricity exchange. The experts and users among whom I conducted participant observation include computer programmers who assist companies that trade in electricity markets by collecting information and making trading suggestions, electrical engineers who design new infrastructures such as electricity markets for buying and selling electricity in bulk, psychologists and social scientists who study people's electricity consumption behavior to generate economic technologies to save money to users and providers of electricity, and citizen groups based in West Virginia and rural Illinois that organize against electricity markets' exclusion of consumers from decision-making mechanisms. Bringing questions of economic anthropology to bear upon the emergent literature of the anthropology of infrastructures, I propose that new economic forms of existence often come to being though infrastructure building and maintenance. For the last 20 years, experts of diverse technical backgrounds have been reprogramming the electric grid to allow for enhanced calculative choice and competition - principles at the core of the neoliberal agenda. I demonstrate that people who do not necessarily concern themselves with the formal study of economics often take the lead in creating and propagating wide-ranging economic emergent forms of life, such as neoliberalism, across the social field. To zero in on their work, I develop the concept of \"techno-economics\": an approach that understands commodities, whether they are living nonhumans such as livestock or inorganic processes like electricity, as more than passive receptacles of human design, and locates humans within their efforts to commoditize and marketize unruly objects, like electricity - a commodity that cannot be stored in warehouses or shipped on highways. Anthropological studies of the techno-economic, I suggest, are best equipped to make connections in ethnographic representation between otherwise disparate nodes of social life, like expertise and wires, law and steel, and finally, economics and electricity.",

The experts and users among whom I conducted participant observation include computer programmers who assist companies that trade in electricity markets by collecting information and making trading suggestions, electrical engineers who design new infrastructures such as electricity markets for buying and selling electricity in bulk, psychologists and social scientists who study people's electricity consumption behavior to generate economic technologies to save money to users and providers of electricity, and citizen groups based in West Virginia and rural Illinois that organize against electricity markets' exclusion of consumers from decision-making mechanisms. Bringing questions of economic anthropology to bear upon the emergent literature of the anthropology of infrastructures, I propose that new economic forms of existence often come to being though infrastructure building and maintenance. For the last 20 years, experts of diverse technical backgrounds have been reprogramming the electric grid to allow for enhanced calculative choice and competition - principles at the core of the neoliberal agenda. I demonstrate that people who do not necessarily concern themselves with the formal study of economics often take the lead in creating and propagating wide-ranging economic emergent forms of life, such as neoliberalism, across the social field. To zero in on their work, I develop the concept of \"techno-economics\": an approach that understands commodities, whether they are living nonhumans such as livestock or inorganic processes like electricity, as more than passive receptacles of human design, and locates humans within their efforts to commoditize and marketize unruly objects, like electricity - a commodity that cannot be stored in warehouses or shipped on highways. Anthropological studies of the techno-economic, I suggest, are best equipped to make connections in ethnographic representation between otherwise disparate nodes of social life, like expertise and wires, law and steel, and finally, economics and electricity."

Relationships built through game mechanics rely on one-sided agency and potential that renders lovers and friends as characters who exist to support the player character in achieving the primary goals of the game. Through these findings, I conclude that even warm interactions in games carry negative, even potentially violent and oppressive, representations and that there is thusly a need for design interventions on the mechanical level to mitigate violence in game worlds and the reinforcement of negative real world stereotypes.",

    "abstract": "Keywords: documentary, interactive, live, liveness, ephemerality, interactivity, theater, performance, television, televisuality, database, data, live data, real time Abstract: The field of documentary is undergoing a transformation as it collides with digital technologies. A new arena of Interactive Documentary production is thriving, and critics and scholars are taking note. Within this field, there is less attention to new opportunities and new theoretical challenges for live practices within the documentary sphere. This thesis argues for a fuller conceptualization of Live Documentary practice. First, it questions the current state of assumptions about documentary, as a form related to the 'document,' as a particularly film-leaning form, and as a lasting and historicizing form of discourse.

A new arena of Interactive Documentary production is thriving, and critics and scholars are taking note. Within this field, there is less attention to new opportunities and new theoretical challenges for live practices within the documentary sphere. This thesis argues for a fuller conceptualization of Live Documentary practice. First, it questions the current state of assumptions about documentary, as a form related to the 'document,' as a particularly film-leaning form, and as a lasting and historicizing form of discourse. Next, it examines the historical underpinnings of two forms of live documentary practice and exemplar projects of each: Live Performance Documentary and Live Subject Documentary. The former is situated in the media category of live theater and performance, and the second, the author will argue, is an instantiation of television in its earliest configuration as a device for two-way audio-visual communications and not just unidirectional broadcasting.

    "abstract": "In the early 1950s, C.C. \"Sparkplug\" Sanders began harvesting brine shrimp from Utah's Great Salt Lake. Sanders built up a small business selling their eggs, called \"cysts, to aquarium stores across the country. During the 80s, cysts were found to be an effective food source for aquaculture and a multimillion-dollar commercial harvesting industry quickly emerged. As the cysts rose in value, competition between harvesters grew fierce and annual catches soon began to drop. Environmentalists also became concerned, as the shrimp are an important food source for millions of migratory birds. The harvest was almost entirely unregulated during this period. Unlike other fisheries, where industry members have fought government intervention, many of the harvesters called on the state to increase oversight. Scientists hired by Utah's natural resource agency found that no comprehensive studies had ever been conducted on the lake's ecosystem, complicating initial efforts to manage the harvest. A twenty-year effort by the state, harvesters and other stakeholders to develop a science-based management strategy has recently begun to pay off as cyst populations appear to be stabilizing and the harvesting industry has once again become profitable.",

Over the past 30 years, with the rising middle class in China, the demand for shark fins has surged. To address the increasing demand, a group of fishermen came to realize there was little value in carting massive shark bodies to shore when all they needed were the highly valued fins.

From enhancing legislation to control the shark fin market to building sustainable fisheries to promoting synthetic shark fin soup - efforts to address the issue of shark depletion are seemingly endless.

    "abstract": "The Caribbean spiny lobster fishery is one of the most important industries in the economy of the Bahamas, and in turn it is one of the largest lobster industries in the world. The natural geography of the Bahamas makes its waters into a lobster haven that Bahamian fishermen have successfully exploited over the past few decades. In 2009, in order to safeguard the industry's future and earn a higher margin, the government and the lobster processors together sought sustainability certification for their product. However, they came up short. The international assessors deemed the data on the health of the lobster stocks to be too minimal, and the legal structures to protect the lobster from over-harvesting to be too weak. In response, the government, together with the World Wildlife Fund, set up a program called the Fishery Improvement Project to get the country's lobster industry on the right track. Under the auspices of the Fishery Improvement Project, the government, local and international NGOs, the processors, and the fishermen themselves are contributing to improving the availability of information on the lobster and to crafting new laws to control the industry. Despite successes in improved communication and stock assessments, there are many obstacles to be overcome: differences of opinion, the spread-out nature of the country, and the limited resources available to enforce the laws. Through interviews with fishermen, government officials, processors, and scientists, this thesis tells the story of how the Fishery Improvement Project began, what it has accomplished, and where the lobster and the humans who harvest them might go from here, when the program wraps up and the fishery reenters the sustainability certification process.",

    "abstract": "In 2009, Larry Leverenz, Eric Nauman, and Thomas Talavage at Purdue University formed the Purdue Neurotrauma Group (PNG), and set out to study concussions in high school football. They set up a study that combined helmet sensors with fMRI brain scans and cognitive testing, hoping to figure out what happens when a player gets a concussion on the field. Instead, they uncovered something shocking and wholly unexpected. Players' brains were significantly changing even in the absence of concussions, due to an accumulation of smaller impacts called subconcussive blows. Years of subsequent research have only confirmed their initial results-season after season, they found that about half of the players in their study that didn't sustain concussions exhibited significant brain changes over the course of a season. They don't yet know exactly how these brain changes relate to short or long-term cognitive damage, but when their findings are scaled across the landscape of high school football, the implications are enormous-brain changes may be occurring in some half a million teenaged athletes. However, even as public awareness of concussions and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) reaches new heights, subconcussive blows continue to fly under the radar. For the past seven years, the PNG has run their research on a shoestring budget, and now, at the end of their funding, they are running out of time and options.

As the numbers grow, a cartoon polar bear despairingly watches the iceberg beneath him slowly melt. Small psychological nudges like this have profoundly shaped people's choices in countless fields, from medicine to economics to policy. But can these tiny nudges help us take on the largest problems? Before the Goliath climate change, here stand the pioneers in psychology, economics and energy management, with a behavioral slingshot in hand.",

    "abstract": "Though zoos have come far from their early days of concrete boxes in caring for their residents' physical health, zoo animals' mental health-the feelings and thoughts beneath the furry and scaly exteriors-has only recently become a serious field of research. The fear of anthropomorphism, or the furnishing of non-human entities with human characteristics such as \"happy\" or \"depressed,\" has discouraged scientists for decades from approaching this seemingly unscientific and unknowable topic. But as the concept of welfare becomes increasingly lauded as the main focus of zoos, crucial to zoos' attendance, their respect by society, and their future existence, zoo keepers, curators, and researchers are beginning to seek out new ways to discover and understand their animals' true feelings-broadening 'animal welfare' to include minds as well as bodies. This thesis explores new studies, technologies, and ways of thinking about animal mental welfare among zoo researchers. Specifically, the thesis focuses on researchers at Brookfield Zoo in Chicago, who have developed a unique tool for studying welfare based on the idea that animals have emotions that can and should be ascertained-and that keepers, those who spend long periods of time with the animals, have the ability to tell how their animals are feeling.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the incidence of violence against Chinese doctors has increased dramatically, with the scale, frequency and viciousness of attacks shocking the world. The challenging doctor-patient relationship remains a complicated issue with no single cause. When the tension intensifies, some news media tend to blame the doctors, using misleading narratives to create sensationalism, thereby aggravating the antagonism between the society and medical professionals. Much scholarship has focused on exploring the social, economic, political, legal, and medical aspects of the doctor- patient relationship. In contrast, little research has been done to interrogate the media's role in contributing to the tension. Additionally, although most studies are concerned with proposing suggestions, no study has posed an intervention to combat the twisted depictions of doctors and to abate the worsening doctor-patient tension. To this end, this thesis examines the role of the media to provide an explanatory analysis of its influence on the doctor-patient relationship, and then leverages on the power of narrative to offer an intervention as an aid to the current doctor-patient tension. User feedback has been collected and analyzed to measure the effectiveness of this project. The aim of this intervention is to help promote perspective taking, increase awareness, and foster understanding toward medical professionals in China.",

    "title": "The Parataxonomist Revolution : how a group of rural Costa Ricans discovered 10,000 new species",
    "abstract": "In northwestern Costa Rica, a team of rural workers called parataxonomists has been inventorying butterfly and moth species for 30 years. Just as a paramedic provides a first round of medical care, a parataxonomist does the on-the-ground work of taxonomy-collection, preparation and data gathering-before sending a specimen on to be analyzed. The parataxonomy program, led by biologists Daniel Janzen and Winnie Hallwachs, is part of the unique conservation model of Costa Rica's Area de Conservacidn Guanacaste (ACG). Hiring local people, rather than students or academics, as permanent field researchers upset traditional research structures, but has paid off for science and for local communities. Some 10,000 new species have been identified through these efforts. The parataxonomists benefit from steady employment in areas of little economic opportunity, and in turn serve as a voice for conservation in their communities. But even as the parataxonomy model is praised abroad-and is being adopted in other countries-its future in Costa Rica is tenuous. This thesis looks at the lives of the parataxonomists of the ACG and the impact of their work. It explores the rise and fall of Costa Rica's National Biodiversity Institute (INBio) and the state of parataxonomy as a model for research and conservation.",
