    "text": "Development of simple 3D-printed scaffolds for liver tissue engineering One solution to the increasing need for liver transplants is to grow implantable liver tissue in the lab. A tissue-engineered liver for transplantation will require complex structures to support cell differentiation and integration with surrounding vasculature. Recent developments in 3D-printing (3DP™) technology allow the construction of such geometrically complex scaffolds out of biodegradable polymers. These artificial tissues should maintain healthy, functional hepatocytes in proper contact with supporting cell types in the context of proper flow cues. This project comprises three major efforts. First, the design and development of a 3D-printed scaffold, constructed of a porous biodegradable polymer matrix, for flow bioreactor culture. Second, the development of protocols for the production, preparation, and flow support of these scaffolds. And third, the employment of standard cell culture methodologies to test the ability of these scaffolds to support liver tissue cultures. Initial cell culture experiments showed similar rates of albumin production in the polymer disk scaffolds compared to cells in silicon-chip scaffolds under appropriately scaled flow conditions, indicating that the polymer scaffolds maintain functioning liver tissue. Further, histology sections of liver tissue grown on these polymer scaffolds show organization of cells into structures reminiscent of in vivo liver. The results of this study show that 3D-printed porous polymer scaffolds have great potential for use as biodegradable tissue culture support devices. It is believed that, combined with printing technologies now under development, the technologies developed in this thesis will help facilitate the construction of an implantable tissue engineered liver.

    "text": "Detection and characterization of rat hepatic stellate cells in a 3-dimensional, perfused, liver bioreactor One of the major challenges in liver research today lay in the understanding of the complex relationship between liver structure and function. The highly orchestrated events that take place in the liver to maintain homeostasis require the presence of all liver cell types. In vivo experiments offer only a snapshot of the liver, and usually involve perturbation of normal function through injury or experimental disease. The role of cell-cell interactions in maintaining normal liver function is far less understood than in pathological conditions. This may be because of the lack of methods in monitoring normal function in vivo. Culturing systems may capture pieces of the puzzle, but often capture only two cell types, and involve mediators presented to the cells in concentrations much higher than physiological values. In addition, the liver lobule contains a 3-dimensional metabolic zonation, and liver cell types comprise a heterogeneous population from the portal triad where the blood flows into the sinusoids to the central vein area where the blood flows out of the sinusoids. Liver cell types are dynamic responders to environmental cues from soluble factors to heterotypic cell interactions, to extracellular matrix proteins. Therefore, a system that serves to promote the health of all liver cell types through a 3-dimensional, perfused scaffold, and allows for self-organization of the liver cells in response to the engineered environment, would serve as a useful tool in understanding some of these complex, orchestrated events. In the research presented here, methods were developed to detect and characterize the heterogeneous population that makes up the hepatic stellate cell population inside the liver bioreactor (Griffith et. al).

    "text": "The detection of immortal DNA strand co-segregation as a method of adult stem cell identification The study of stem cells is one of the most fascinating topics in biology. Adult stem cells (ASC), which play the prime role in the maintenance and restoration of tissues, are thought to hold great potential for the advancement of medicine. It has been postulated that adult stem cells are able to retain \"immortal\" DNA template strands over successive generations by non-random chromosome co-segregation, and in so doing, to protect the long-term genomic fidelity of whole tissue compartments. The investigation of this theory may yield insights into areas such as the development of cancer and the process of aging. In addition, it may lead to the discovery of an effective method for the unique identification of adult stem cells, the study of which has thus far suffered from the lack of unique identifiers. Thus, the goal of this research was to develop an assay for the detection of immortal DNA strand co-segregation that could be applied to the detection and analysis of adult stem cells. It is proposed that such an assay may in itself serve as a unique identification method for adult stem cells. In this thesis, the development of such an assay is described. This assay, referred to as the label release assay, has provided further evidence for the existence of immortal strand co-segregation in model cell lines, and will potentially be useful in the study of adult stem cells in tissues.

This polymer has the unique properties of being cell resistant and chemically versatile such that various cell ligands can be coupled to its side chains. These properties allow adhesion through specific cell receptors to be studied without the effect of background adhesion to adsorbed proteins. By taking advantage of the ability to target specific receptors the comb polymer could be used as a powerful sorting tool. Sorting could be accomplished by finding cell type specific adhesion ligands. Several possible such ligands were screened. A ligand containing the tripeptide sequence RGD was found to elicit a strong cell adhesion response. However, this ligand is adherent to many cell types of the liver and would not be suitable for sorting purposes. Other cell type specific ligands tested showed little to no affinity for liver cell adhesion. Additionally, the comb was utilized to study α₅β₁ integrin-specific hepatocyte adhesion and the effect of Epidermal Growth Factor on adhesion. α₅β₁ integrin adhesion was mediated using a novel branched peptide, SynKRGD. This peptide consists of a linear peptide sequence containing RGDSP and the synergy site sequence PHSRN connected by the sequence GGKGGG. By utilizing the amine side group of Lysine a GGC branch was added. The terminal cysteine was used to conjugate SynKRGD to comb polymer surfaces using N-(p-Maleimidophenyl) isocyanate (PMPI) chemistry.

A variety of in vitro culture systems have been developed to address different aspects of liver physiology and architecture in order to recreate the microenvironment. These in vitro co-culture strategies have been limited by their inability to systematically characterize the addition of non-parenchymal cells. In this dissertation, I use gene expression levels quantified by real-time RT-PCR to determine tissue composition. The identified genes demonstrate significant cell-type specificity, magnitude, and stability of expression in vivo and throughout each step of cell isolation process. In the course of this development, we establish protocols to accurately isolate and count an enriched fraction of primary NPC's. Experiments on the perfusion and isolation process prove that there exists an inverse correlation between perfusion flow rate and NPC yield and viability. Further, we have characterized the tissue composition of each step in the cell isolation process and the resulting NPC population to confirm that a significant number of each NPC type is delivered to in vitro co-culture. System output analysis of spheroids co-cultured at physiological ratios and seeded into the milliF bioreactor shows the presence of stellate cells, but the absence of endothelial (EC) and kupffer cells (KC). The same analysis of 2D collagen gel sandwiches shows the presence of all NPC cell types. This indicates that our process is currently limited by the ability of EC's and KC's to incorporate into spheroid aggregates.

This work is to further study the characteristics of the peptides KLD12 and RID12 and to generate new ways to control the properties of them. Peptide structures in solution were studied with circular dichroism and dynamic light scattering, and material properties of the peptide solutions were studied with rheology. Nanofiber structure was studied through atomic force microscopy. Sonication was found to have a minimal effect on KLD12, while pH could alter the length of the fibers formed. The presence of a second type of peptide in solution interacted with nanofibers of another peptide and resulted in a decrease of average fiber length. Peptide solutions transitioned from a viscous solution to a gel as the concentration of peptide increased, both alone and in mixture with another peptide. Understanding the properties of these peptides will help researchers design new biomaterials and improve applications of self-assembling peptides. ",

The field of tissue engineering and organ regeneration has been born out of the high demand for organ transplants. However, one of the critical limitations in regeneration of vital organs is the lack of an intrinsic blood supply. This work expands on the development of microfluidic scaffolds for vascular tissue engineering applications by employing microfabrication techniques. Unlike previous efforts, this work focuses on fabricating this scaffolds from poly(glycerol-sebacate) (PGS), a novel biodegradable elastomer with superior mechanical properties. The transport properties of oxygen and carbon dioxide in PGS were measured through a series of time-lag diffusion experiments. The results of these measurements were used to calculate a characteristic length scale for oxygen diffusion limits in PGS scaffolds. Microfluidic scaffolds were then produced using fabrication techniques specific for PGS. Initial efforts have resulted in solid PGS-based scaffolds with biomimetic fluid flow and capillary channels on the order of 10 microns in width. These scaffolds have also been seeded with endothelial cells and perfused continuously in culture for up to 14 days resulting in partially confluent channels. More complex fabrication techniques were also demonstrated. A novel electrodeposition technique was used in the fabrication of biomimetic microfluidic masters. Thin-walled devices were also synthesized to accommodate the relatively low gas permeability of PGS. ",

A library of approximately 4,800 yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) deletion strains produced by the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project and consisting essentially of all possible mutants having one non-essential gene deleted (and replaced with unique identification tags called \"bar codes\") from the genome are employed in this endeavor. The methods focus on gathering phenotype data in a high-throughput manner and in response to the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). The first method makes use of a new technology called the Living ChipTM, which can hold libraries of compounds or cell cultures in an array of 50-nl channels and which could ideally accommodate all deletion strains on a single array. The second method involves pooling all strains together in a single culture and allowing them to grow competitively to determine their relative fitness based on a specific treatment. ",

These cells come from the pre-implantation embryo, whose native environment is the hypoxic mammalian reproductive tract. Growing stem cells in an environment with higher oxygen levels (i.e. the atmospheric oxygen levels that are normally used to cultivate stem cells) could be bad for the cells, as oxygen is toxic due to its powerful oxidative capacity. In this experiment, J1 murine embryonic stem cells were grown at 0%, 2%, 5%, 10%, and 20% oxygen by volume to assess the effects that lower oxygen levels have on stem cell growth, plating efficiency, and metabolism. Two reaction vessels were built so that the cells could be grown in a controlled environment. Premixed gas cylinders were used to flush the vessels and an optical probe was used to measure the headspace oxygen concentration. Cells were found to grow faster than atmospheric conditions when in a moderately hypoxic environment where the oxygen concentration was between 2% and 10%, and considerably slower than atmospheric conditions as the headspace oxygen concentration approached zero. Maximum cell density decreased, glucose-lactate yield increased, glucose-cell yield decreased, and glutamine-cell yield decreased as headspace oxygen decreased. There were no strong correlations between oxygen concentration and glutamine-ammonia yield or plating efficiency. From the results of this study, it appears that it may be preferable to grow murine embryonic stem cells in a moderately hypoxic environment around 10% oxygen to increase the growth rate while minimizing the maximum cell density and metabolic inefficiency compromises.

In this research, an ES cell line with transfected green fluorescent protein (GFP) co-expressed by an Oct-4 promoter was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) to obtain such profile. As Oct-4 is an ES cell differentiation marker whose expression varies with pluripotency, GFP expression could simply be measured in these cells to determine how pluripotent they are as a population. The differentiation characterization of ES cells was also conducted with different culture conditions of reduced serum and glucose concentrations both in the presence and absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) which prevents spontaneous differentiation, as well as at varied LIF concentrations and seeding densities. In addition, fundamental growth kinetic and metabolic profiles were obtained to get a more complete picture of how ES cells behave under these varied culturing conditions. The doubling time (t[sub]d) of R1 Oct4-GFP cell line was found to be 13 hours in LIF⁺ culture and 8 hours in culture with LIF addition after 7 days of LIF withdrawal, implying that cell proliferation rate is higher for cells receiving a sudden upregulation of genes controlling cell division through LIF addition. Although the upregulation of the genes is rapid, the downregulation of these genes through LIF withdrawal was found to take 6-7 days, while 3-4 days were required to downregulate the pou5f gene (which controls Oct4 expression).

The point stiffness of the TM increased with frequency when radial forces were applied but showed no trend with frequency for longitudinal forces. Displacement of surrounding tissue decreased as distance from the probe increased. Space constants were on the order of tens of micrometers.

Growth rate (R²Adj=0.901), however, varies strongly with agitation and salt concentration, but much more weakly with glycerol concentration.

However, these applications are limited because of the difficulty in isolating and expanding pure populations of adult stem cells (ASCs). A major barrier to ASC expansion in vitro is their property of asymmetric cell kinetics. Our lab has developed a method, Suppression of Asymmetric Cell Kinetics (SACK), to expand ASCs in vitro by shifting their cell kinetics program from asymmetric to symmetric. We have found that guanine nucleotide precursors can be used to convert the kinetics of adult stem cells from asymmetric to symmetric, which promotes their exponential expansion. Previously, we have used the SACK method to derive hepatic and cholangiocyte stem cell strains from adult rat livers in vitro. These cell strains provide an assay to evaluate whether growth factors and cytokines previously implicated in proliferation of progenitor cells act by converting the kinetics of the stem cells in the population from asymmetric to symmetric, and thus identify new SACK agents.

Anti-angiogenics alone have not proven effective in inducing tumor regression in the clinic due to both the cytostatic nature of anti-angiogenic therapy and the potential formation of new regions of hypoxia within the tumor after therapy. The new therapeutic paradigm is for combining both anti-angiogenics and traditional cytotoxic agents for a synergistic effect. The efficacy of cytotoxic agents may be reduced after anti-angiogenic therapy, however, due to limited access to tumor vasculature and hypoxia-induced drug resistance. We propose that loading cytotoxic agents within the tumor prior to blood vessel collapse will enable both greater drug accumulation within the tumor as well as a reduction in the formation of therapy-induced regions of hypoxia. We present here a novel nanodelivery vehicle termed a 'nanocell' for the spatio-temporal recruitment of both anti-angiogenics and cytotoxic agents within the solid tumor to achieve this goal.

Back-focal-plane detection provides a way of measuring the displacement, in two-dimensions, at nanometer or better resolution. The first part of this work will describe the design of a simple and inexpensive position sensing module customized for optical tweezers applications. Single molecule fluorescence is another powerful technique used to obtain microscopic details in biological systems. This technique can detect the arrival of a single molecule into a small volume of space or detect the conformational changes of a single molecule. Combining optical tweezers with single-molecule fluorescence so that one can apply forces on a single molecule while monitoring its effects via single molecule fluorescence provides an even more powerful experimental platform to perform such microscopic studies. Due to the enhanced photobleaching of fluorophores caused by the trapping laser, this combined technology has only been demonstrated under optimized conditions. ",

    "text": "A novel high-throughput in-cell Western assay for the quantitative measurement of signaling dynamics in DNA damage signaling networks : cell decision processes in response to DNA double strand breaks Following exposure to DNA damage, cells initiate a stress response involving multiple protein kinase signaling cascades. The DNA damage response results in one of several possible cell-fate decisions, or cellular responses: induction of cell-cycle arrest, initiation of DNA repair, activation of transcriptional programs, and either apoptosis, necrosis or cell senescence. The mechanisms by which cells make these decisions, and how cell fate depends upon variables such as DNA damage type and dose, and other environmental factors, is unknown. The process by which cells select among alternate fates following such stimuli, or \"cues\" is likely to involve a dynamic, multi-variate integration of signals from each of the kinase signaling components. A major goal of signal transduction research is to understand how information flows through signal transduction pathways downstream of a given cue, such as DNA damage, and how signals are integrated, in order to mediate cellular responses. Mathematical modeling approaches are necessary to advance our understanding of these processes. ",

These metals may have negative biological effects on cells by disrupting homeostatic cellular processes and altering normal signal transduction. One possible mechanism for many of these negative effects may involve overproduction of reactive oxygen species that damage proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. To compound this oxidative damage, there is evidence consistent with the inhibition of repair of damaged DNA by these metals. As a result, there is an increase in mutagenicity and toxicity in the organisms. This thesis reviews the current literature relevant to the biochemistry and biology of arsenic and cadmium. ",

This deformation has been shown to result in significant reductions in both the shear storage and shear loss moduli of the cell, with subsequent recovery towards their initial values. Also, deformation above a threshold stimulus results in neutrophil activation, evidenced by pseudopod projection from the cell. These two events are thought to occur via independent pathways, yet little is known about the mechanosensing signaling involved. Other work has demonstrated that physiological deformation of neutrophils induces a marked increase in the levels of cytosolic calcium, suggesting that this occurrence may trigger the biomechanical response observed in the cell. The aim of this thesis was to elucidate the role of calcium in the neutrophil response to the mechanical deformation experienced during transit through the pulmonary capillaries. ",

The desire is to differentiate among diseased and healthy cells, cell age, and cell type with the minimum amount of sample pretreatment. This project addresses this need by developing microfluidic devices that exploit the adhesion differences between cell states and cell types to rapidly count cells of different types without the need for labels. There are two avenues in which to explore cell adhesion differences with these devices, the first is a net electrostatic change at the surface of the cell wall and the second is the presence of specific cell-membrane adhesion proteins. It is hypothesized that the forced interaction of the cell wall with the microfabricated microcapillary walls would result in a differential velocity based on cell type that could be detected simply using a microscope and video camera or an interferometer. The eventual integration of cell velocity detection would result in a portable all-inclusive lab-on-a-chip system that could be used in the field for detecting the presence of diseases, such as malaria and cancer as well as in a lab setting for drug discovery.

Using RNA interference or peptide inhibitors to downregulate specific connexins we examined the role of gap junctions in intercellular diffusion, calcium excitation, and in mediating the expression of vascular regulators transforming growth factor-[Beta][ (TGF-[beta]), prostacyclin, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). siRNA inhibition of connexin 43 in porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAEC) significantly decreased the diffusion distance of Lucifer yellow dye and cytoplasmic calcium levels after mechanical wounding. Wound healing experiments suggested that stimulatory signals travel through gap junctions containing connexin 43, while inhibitory signal travel through gap junctions containing connexin 37. Connexin 43 and connexin 37 inhibition, alone or in combination, reduced the levels of secreted latent TGF-[beta] in confluent PAEC monolayers after 24 hours of incubation. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) behaved in a similar manner. Inhibition of any one of the three connexins resulted in a marked increase in eNOS concentration. ",

Research currently involves mass screenings of different combinations of vector components without a true understanding of how each component interacts with the target cell. Few tools are currently available for scientists to quantitatively examine these vector-to-cell interactions or determine the rate limiting steps within the gene delivery pathway. Thus, researchers cannot fully optimize the vector design to reach maximal delivery efficiency. This project seeks to address this issue by modifying a density gradient electrophoresis (DGE) device originally developed on Mel Juso cells to segregate primary rat hepatocyte lysate into nuclear, early endosomal, late endosomal/lysosomal, and cytoplasmic fractions. We found that according to the Horseradish Peroxidase assay, late endosomes and lysosomes consistently localize to fractions 11-13 and early endosomes in fractions 18 to 21. There was minimal labeling in fractions 14 through 17 demonstrating that separation of the organelles was achieved. With this higher resolution fractionation, movement through the endosomal pathway can be studied in greater detail. ",

Recombinant protein subunits and peptides are relatively safe alternatives to live attenuated pathogens. However, these antigens are poorly immunogenic when administered alone in solution form and thus require the use of an adjuvant. To this end, we have developed a hydrogel-based nanoparticulate system to encapsulate protein antigen and to co-deliver it with DNA/RNA-based adjuvants to dendritic cells, the key antigen presenting cells in primary immune responses. Using CpG oligonucleotides or siRNA as adjuvants, we observed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for interleukin 12 and interferon-[alpha], respectively, that DCs were activated by CpG oligonucleotide- and siRNA-functionalized nanoparticles [approx.]10-fold more potently than by soluble CpG or siRNA ligands.

Studies with IGF-1: Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1) is a potent anabolic factor capable of endocrine and paracrine/autocrine signaling. Previous studies have demonstrated that mechanical compression can regulate the action of IGF-1 on chondrocyte biosynthesis in intact tissue; when applied simultaneously, these stimuli act by distinct cell activation pathways. Our objectives were to elucidate the extent and kinetics of the chondrocyte transcriptional response to combined IGF-1 and static compression in cartilage explants. Discussion: Clustering analysis revealed five distinct groups. TIMP-3 and ADAMTS-5, MMP-l and IGF-2, and IGF-1 and Collagen II, were all robustly co-expressed under all conditions tested. In comparing gene expression levels to previously measured aggrecan biosynthesis levels, aggrecan synthesis is shown to be transcriptionally regulated by IGF- 1, whereas inhibition of aggrecan synthesis by compression is not transcriptionally regulated.

Highly oxygen-demanding hepatocytes are commonly maintained under oxygen-deficient culture conditions, limited by culture medium thickness as well scaffold thickness. Thus, the cells are forced into anaerobic metabolic states that degenerate liver specific functions. Furthermore, cells separated from their extracellular matrix and disconnected from the synergistic interactions between other hepatic cells types further exacerbate hepatocellular function. This study aims to improve hepatospecific activity, especially CYP3A2 - a biomarker that is notoriously known to quickly lose expression in primary cultures, by creating a platform based on collagen sandwich cultures. The modified sandwich cultures are substituted with self-assembling peptide, RAD16-I, combined with integrin-binding sequence RGD or laminin receptor binding sequence YIGSR functional peptide motifs to create a cell-instructive peptide scaffold. To facilitate oxygen and nutrient diffusion and exchange, plasma modification technology is employed to control peptide layer dimension.

In order to prevent neuronal degeneration and potentially repair or regenerate the damaged motor output circuitry, it will be necessary to understand the molecular and genetic factors that control, direct, and enhance differentiation, axonal projection and connectivity. While techniques are available to separate specific populations of neurons once they are fully-differentiated, current methods make it nearly impossible to monitor or control the development of a neural precursor in standard open culture.

Human RefSeq exons obtained from the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser were analyzed for tissue-specific skipping. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were aligned to exons and their tissue of origin and histology were identified. ACEs were also identified as a subset of the skipped exons.

The different datasets were analyzed for both general features such as exon and intron length, splice site strength, base composition, conservation, modularity, and susceptibility to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay caused by skipping.

In order to observe the synergistic interactions of the eight different muscles in the tongue, MRI techniques were used to determine the three-dimensional fiber architecture, measure the mechanical function of the tongue during swallow, and relate the two quantitatively to identify fiber contraction. Diffusion Tensor Imaging was applied to the in vivo tongue of five subjects at rest to image the tongue myoarchitecture. The data revealed the complex relationships between extrinsic and intrinsic fibers. Phase Contrast MRI was applied to ten subjects to assess the complex array of mechanical events occurring during the propulsive phase of swallowing. Physiological strain rate data was acquired in 4 and 6 time point series during approximately 3 ml water bolus swallows. Data acquisition was gated to pressure from the tip of the tongue against the hard palate, indicating the beginning of the irreversible late accommodation. This method demonstrated that the propulsive phase of swallowing is associated with a precisely organized series of compressive and expansive strain rate events. Individual subject data sets from both of these methods were then related. The alignment between local fiber direction and the co-located strain rate tensor was quantified by the dot product between the two vectors.

In the case of influenza, activated T cells migrate from the mediastinal (draining) lymph nodes to the lung where they perform their cytolytic function. After pathogen clearance, memory CD8+ T cells are generated, giving rise to long-term protection from reinfection. However, these cells are no longer detectable in the lung parenchyma six months post-infection, and cell-mediated immunity, and protection is lost. Knock-out studies in mice show that interleukin 15 (IL-15) is essential for memory CD8+ T cell proliferation. Fibroblasts, macrophages, dendritic cells and epithelial cells express IL-15 and its receptor isoform [alpha] (IL-15R[alpha]). Histological studies suggest that memory CD8+ T cells preferentially reside in peribronchiolar and perivascular areas, the stroma, of the lung. We hypothesize that memory CD8+ T cells preferentially reside in regions where molecules necessary for their maintenance, for example, IL-15/R secreting cells, are located.

The strength of integrin-ECM bonds has been noted to increase in response to the application of force. However, the strengthening of cadherin-cadherin bonds in response to force has not been studied. Here, we use magnetic trapping to probe adhesion strengthening at cadherin adherens junctions, using cadherin-coated magnetic beads to simulate neighboring cells and apply force at adherens junctions. 43% of beads exposed to a high force (2.1 nN) detached, compared to 31% of those exposed to a low-to-high force ramp followed by high force. This indicates that adherens junctions are strengthened by force application.

Cells treated with actin-inhibitor cytochalasin D showed no difference in bead detachment from constant high force and from ramped followed by high force, indicating that the actin cytoskeleton is crucial in the adhesion strengthening response. Beads attached to cells expressing GFP-VASP, which behave like VASP-overexpressing cells, detached in 24% of trials when exposed to constant high force, compared to 39% of trials in response to ramped force.

By recognition of specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), TLR-4 can in tandem initiate a pair of downstream signaling pathways to regulate cytokine/chemokine release, endotoxin tolerance and apoptosis, which have been suggested to directly or indirectly participate in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses. However, little is known about their detailed signal-response relationships. In this thesis, we sought to identify these potential signal-response relationships in RAW264.7 cells through systematic analysis. We first measured LPS stimulated dynamic signaling profiles over a range of an inhibitor of p38 MAPK, SB202190 concentrations for a distribution of kinases centrally involved in TLR-4 signaling network. We then applied quantitative analytical approaches to determine the most important signals or signal combinations contributing to induction of either IL-6 and TNF-ao secretion or apoptosis and construct their corresponding predictive mathematical models. Particularly, we found that the partial least squares regression (PLSR) models built using the ratio of phosphorylated Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) predicted LPS plus SB202190-induced apoptosis accurately even following perturbation with pharmacological inhibitors of JNK and ERK. Thus, by combining experimental and computational approaches, this thesis has proposed two new potential targets, JNK and ERK, for development of drug therapies against bacterial infection. ",

Therefore, novel animal models represent valuable research tools in understanding T2D. To develop a novel mouse model of T2D, I characterized an outbred mouse discovered at MIT that displayed clinical signs of diabetes. Prevalence of glucosuria in the Swiss Webster colony reached 60% (n=70) in males 8 weeks to 6 months of age. Despite severe obesity in some females, no females were diabetic. Pathologic findings in affected males included cachexia, dilated gastrointestinal tracts with poor muscular tone, pancreatic islet degeneration and atrophy with compensatory metaplasia and/or neogenesis, bacterial pyelonephritis, membranous glomerulopathy, and late-onset hepatic tumors with macrosteatosis, microsteatosis and hydropic change in aged males. Serum insulin correlated with blood glucose in a nonlinear pattern suggestive of islet exhaustion. Circulating leptin levels showed a weak inverse correlation with glucose. Diabetic males were bred with obese colony females to produce 20 male and 20 female offspring. Prevalence of diabetes in male offspring was 80% (16/20) with a median age of onset of 18 weeks. In contrast, no diabetic females were identified, despite being significantly more obese than males. Male predominance is likewise a feature of T2D in humans. ",

    "text": "Design and in vitro development of resorbable urologic drug delivery device Implantable, controlled release drug delivery devices offer several advantages over systemic oral administration routes and immediate drug release treatments including direct therapy to target organ, more continuous maintenance of plasma and tissue drug levels and the potential for reduced side effects or toxicity. Urology has emerged as a unique field in which minimally invasive implantation techniques are available and such devices could provide improved beneficial therapies over conventional treatments. Urological indications for which localized drug therapy is already being advocated and investigated are highly suitable for treatment with implantable controlled release devices. This thesis describes the in vitro performance evaluation of an implantable, bio-resorbable device that can provide localized drug therapy of ciprofloxacin (CIP) to the seminal vesicle and nearby prostate gland for treatment of chronic prostatitis (CP). The device functions as an elementary osmotic pump (EOP) to release CIP for a period of 2-3 weeks after implantation in the seminal vesicle (SV) through transrectal needle injection or cystoscopic methods. The device is composed of an elastomeric, resorbable polymer cast in a tubular geometry with solid drug powder packed into its core and a micromachined release orifice drilled through its wall. Drug release experiments were performed to determine the effective release rate from a single orifice and the range of orifice size in which osmotic-controlled zero-order release was the dominant mechanism of drug delivery from the device. Device stability and function in an alkaline environment of similar pH to that of the SVs and infected prostate gland was also assessed in vitro. The device was found to function well in both de-ionized water and NaOH pH-8 solution with a sustained zero-order release rate of 2.47 ± 0.29 jtg/hr when fabricated with an orifice of diameter 100-150pm.

    "text": "Multi-scale analysis of cardiac myoarchitecture The distribution and generation of force within the myocardium during normal contractility is dictated by the tissue's underlying 3D myoarchitecture. The presence of disordered myoarchitecture may in turn constitute the pathological basis of impaired cardiac mechanics in numerous clinical conditions, such as the remodeling heart following myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathies. To investigate the multi-scale nature of architectural disarray in the setting of myocardial disease, a dual imaging approach consisting of diffusion spectrum magnetic resonance imaging (DSI) and high-speed multislice two-photon microscopy (TPM) was used. DSI is a technique that derives fiber orientation from directionality of proton diffusion, whereas TPM derives cellular alignment from an autocorrelation of 3D resolved images of cells and subcellular structure. Mesoscale tract representations of myofiber orientation are generated from similarly aligned diffusion or autocorrelation vectors. These methods were applied to study induced myocardial infarction in the rat and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated with deletion of the gene for myosin binding protein C (cMyBP-C) in the mouse. Normal cardiac muscle fiber alignment within the ventricular wall was characterized by a series of helical tracts transitioning from a lefthanded orientation in the subepicardium to circumferential in the mid-myocardium to righthanded in the subendocardium. Infarcted hearts displayed a fiber void in the infarct zone and an extension of both subepicardial and subendocardial fibers beyond the border zone. It's hypothesized that the growth of fibers contributes to the remodeling process and provides tensile strength to the myocardium during contraction. ",

    "text": "Symmetric signaling by an asymmetric 1 erythropoietin : 2 erythropoietin receptor complex One erythropoietin molecule binds asymmetrically to two identical receptor monomers via erythropoietin site 1 and site 2, although it is unclear how asymmetry affects receptor activation and signaling. Here we report the computational design and experimental validation of two mutant erythropoietin receptors: one that binds only to erythropoietin site 1 but not site 2, and one that binds only to site 2 but not site 1. Expression of either mutant receptor alone in Ba/F3 cells cannot elicit a signal in response to erythropoietin, but when co-expressed, there is a proliferative response and activation of the JAK2 Stat5 signaling pathway. A truncated erythropoietin receptor with only one cytosolic tyrosine (Y343), on only one receptor monomer is sufficient for signaling in response to erythropoietin, regardless of the monomer on which it is located. The same results apply to having only one conserved juxtamembrane hydrophobic L253 or W258 residue, essential for JAK2 activation, in the full-length receptor dimer. We conclude that despite asymmetry in the ligand-receptor dimer interaction, both sides are competent for signaling, and we suggest that the receptors signal equally. ",

    "text": "Implementing lean methodologies within a maintenance organization The primary goal of the project was to make the machine maintenance process more efficient. In order to do this, we conducted a 3-day Value Stream Mapping workshop, during which we generated a map of the present value stream. We identified shortcomings and inefficiencies within this value stream, and then mapped out a future state Value Stream, creating a 90-day action plan to move towards that desired future state. This action plan relied heavily upon measuring and improving key performance indicators, which allowed us to make objective measures of our progress. A second internship objective was to reduce the number of clean room re-sanitizations. Currently, clean rooms undergo a costly and time-consuming re-sanitization whenever an air handler is shut down for a brief period of time. It is likely that some of these cleanings are unnecessary, and eliminating extraneous cleanings could reduce maintenance costs significantly. In order to reduce unnecessary clean room re-sanitizations, we designed and conducted a study to measure environmental standards during an air handler shutdown. Genzyme's Validation and Quality Control Departments approved this experimental plan prior to execution. We shut down an air handler that supplied a clean room, and monitored the air for viable and non-viable particles for several hours. Viable particulate levels did not exceed action limits during a four-hour shutdown, and non-viable particulates dropped to pre-experiment levels as soon as we re-started the air handler. Based on these results, we conclude that air-handler shutdowns should not require room re-sanitization. ",

    "text": "Cell and nanomaterial-based approaches for diagnosis and chemotherapy of metastatic cancer cells Metastasis is a multistep process during which tumor cells separate from a primary tumor, penetrate the bloodstream, evade host defenses, and colonize distant organs. This final and fatal step in tumor development is the cause of more than 90% of cancer related deaths. Therapies and diagnostics can be targeted to metastasis at three points in its progression: the primary tumor, the secondary tumor, and circulating tumor cells (CTCs). While much work has focused on primary tumors, less effort has concentrated on targeted isolation, detection and therapy of deeply penetrated metastases and CTCs. Here, I discuss cell and nanomaterial-based approaches for detecting and ablating these malignant populations. The number of CTCs in the blood directly correlates with disease progression; however, the lack of definitive markers has limited their isolation and characterization. I have demonstrated the potential use of platelets as a cell-based marker for isolation and detection of CTCs. Using phage display technology, it was possible to identify candidate peptides specific to mesenchymal-like tumor cells that may mimic the motile and aggressive CTC population. In order to detect and ablate metastases and CTCs, M13 bacteriophage was engineered into a platform for simultaneous tumor targeting, imaging, and therapy. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and doxorubicin, a chemotherapeutic agent, were loaded on phage for fluorescent near-infrared imaging and cytotoxicity of metastatic lesions, respectively. The near-infrared optical properties of SWNTs in the \"second window\" make them promising candidates for imaging nascent and deeply seeded tumors. This approach provides an 'all-in-one' platform for targeted fluorescence imaging and efficient drug delivery and may allow for real-time monitoring of tumor response to drug regimens. ",

    "text": "Development and application of tools for glycan characterization Glycans are essential components of all living things because they function as key elements of cellular membranes and extracellular spaces by mediating cell-cell communication, transduction pathways, and cellular development, function, and survival. Because glycans are secondary gene products that depend on the availability of sub-cellular enzymes for synthesis, research on their structure, synthesis, and biological significance has lagged behind that of DNA and proteins due to both a lack of appreciation of their importance and the slow pace at which tools are being developed to study them. In this thesis, three projects focus on the development, application, and exploration of tools for glycan characterization. The first project resulted in the successful optimization of an analytical method to isolate and characterize O-linked glycans, on which relatively few research projects focus because of the limited availability of tools to isolate them and the need for specific analytical equipment to properly characterize them. Using this optimized method, the O-linked glycans of bovine mucin and fetuin were successfully profiled, and the analysis of the former provided the motivation for a second project focused on the significance of goblet cells and mucins in influenza infection. This project explored the potential benefits of a glycoprotein direct binding assay as a way to obtain quantitative information about lectin and influenza hemagglutinin specificities. Using mucins adsorbed to a polystyrene plate, it was possible to obtain quantitative binding constants for two commonly used lectins. The last project focused on the isolation and characterization of the cell surface N-linked glycans from chicken erythrocytes, turkey erythrocytes, and human tracheal epithelial (HTE) cells. Analysis of these cell types is warranted due to their importance as model systems to study influenza infection. The results of this project provide a context for future questions about the relevance of the erythrocyte model system for studying influenza binding specificities. All of these projects reiterate the importance of the study of glycobiology by showing how both the development and application of tools to study glycans can provide in new and interesting information about pathological processes related to human health and disease.

    "text": "The growth and stress response characterization of Synechococcus WH8109 cyanobacteria Oceanic cyanobacteria are amongst the most populous species on the planet and have been found in every ocean around the world. These photosynthetic organisms play a major role in the global carbon cycle. They have adapted to a number of different temperature, light, and nutrient niches. However, as important primary producers in the oceans, these organisms play a vital role which may be threatened by global climate change and pollution. As research on cyanobacterial species progresses, these organisms have been found to show promise as potential sources of biofuel, renewable energy, and agents for bioremediation. In order to utilize these organisms for future engineering applications and basic scientific research, it is important to be able to grow the organism in a stable and reproducible manner. This research characterizes the growth of Synechococcus WH8109 in the laboratory. In the laboratory, cell culture densities of greater than 109 cells/mL with a doubling time of approximately 24 hours were achieved when grown at 28'C with a 24 hour light cycle in sea water and artificial salt water media. Not only did cyanobacteria evolve long before their distant enteric cousins, but they harness nearly all of their energy through photosynthesis. The photosystem is constantly subjected to photo-oxidative damage and degradation. Interesting insight may be gained by studying this complex repair process in the bacterial counterpart to plants, prior to applying these concepts to higher order plant species. Chaperones have been implicated in this repair process. In order to better characterize the stress response of WH8109, I have also isolated the Synechococcus homologue of GroEL using anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography and sucrose gradient centrifugation. The expression levels of this chaperone were analyzed under normal and stress conditions and they have been shown to respond to heat shock and infection. ",

    "text": "Process Improvement in Biotech : Dealing with High Complexity Processes Across numerous conventional manufacturing sites, process improvement initiatives have been shown to increase production capabilities while decreasing costs - all without a required system- wide overhaul of the manufacturing site. For the biotech industry, this presents an interesting challenge. Through its upbringings as a highly interdisciplinary field, manufacturing unique biologics poses new and complex barriers to a process improvement initiative. However, though the challenge is daunting, process improvement in this field will in fact increase the reward two-fold. First, as with conventional manufacturing sites, costs and lead times will decrease while potentially increasing profits. Second, the ability to better produce more life improving drugs, and at a more affordable price to patients is in fact a reward unto itself - one that is at the forefront of Genzyme's culture. The turnaround process, where the manufacturing of biologics is halted in order to maintain a key manufacturing process, is a critical point in the production of biologics. The ability to reduce the time and variability of this process will directly and significantly increase Genzyme's manufacturing capacity. Currently, this turnaround process takes approximately 8±1 days, and it is hoped that it will be possible to attain a new turnaround time of 6±1 days through a number of process improvement methodologies such as lean manufacturing. The effects of implementation of a number of lean tools such as standardized workflow, visual management and an automation of the pressure-hold test were studied here. Our observations reveal that by introducing lean methodology the communication and coordination around the complex turnaround process improved, which led to a more manageable and repeatable process. By automating the pressure-hold test it will be possible to significantly reduce the test time and free up resources to perform additional turnaround activities. Even with these preliminary results, it is clear that the path to process improvement at Genzyme is possible, though not without its inherent difficulties. This work provides a critical framework for a number of techniques used, and serves as a case study in understanding the underlying rewards and difficulties with process improvement in the biotech industry.

Key to the understanding of the fundamental principles and designs by which molecular motor function has been the kinesin family. Missing, however, is a clear understanding of the series of events that take place at the atomistic level when kinesin walks on a microtubule and generates force. Recent MD simulations have identified the force-generating mechanism in kinesin, the cover-neck bundle, and strongly suggest that the formation of the CNB by the N-terminal cover strand and the C-terminal neck linker of the motor head are responsible for force generation. In this thesis we present tools developed in the Lang Laboratory to further elucidate the stepping motion and force generation mechanism of kinesin using Drosophila kinesin as a model system. We demonstrate the function of a force clamp specifically designed for the laboratory and show traces of WT kinesin walking under constant load. We also purified and tested kinesin mutants running under a force load. We present two assays specifically designed to study the interaction between kinesin and the last 10-18 C-terminal residues of a-p tubulin, the E-hook. We were unable to observe kinesin - e-hook interactions, such as those suggested by the formation of tethers, when the e-hook was bound to the surface. In the case of e-hook in solution, our results indicate that 2G kinesin was still functional and its stall force approximately 3 pN just as for the case when no e-hook is present. We also propose ways that the work in this thesis can be expanded. The force clamp can be easily adapted to study novel kinesin mutants under constant load in 2D. In addition, the force clamp can be used to probe the kinesin - e-hook interactions by looking at kinesin walking over microtubules with cleaved e-hooks. The e-hook assays presented in this thesis can also be expanded to include higher concentrations of e-hook or be performed using labeled e-hook to assess single molecule interactions and concentrations.

    "text": "A new mouse model to probe the role of aflatoxin B₁ in liver carcinogenesis One and a half million new cancer cases are reported each year in the United States. Despite this overwhelming burden of disease, current preventative treatments and early detection techniques are inadequate. With cancers, as with many aggressive diseases, time is of the essence; earlier detection begets better patient prognoses. While contemporary technology offers physicians the ability to battle cancers via stage-one detection, few reliable biomarkers have been developed to assist in detection of upstream tumorigenesis or interpretation of early genomic assault. The objective of the work described here is to identify early biomarkers specific to tumorigenesis, which correlate with initial genomic assault and subsequent mutation in the gpt-delta (B6C3F1) mouse model. The test compound used in this work is aflatoxin B₁, a known human carcinogen produced by fungal spoilage of food materials. Aflatoxin B₁ was one of the carcinogens used in the \"training set\" of compounds that defined the B6C3F1 animal model. My work had three goals with regard to upgrading this model as a tool for contemporary toxicology. In the first part of the thesis, a kinetic profile was generated of AFB 1-DNA adduct formation and removal. In the second part of the work, adduct levels and specific DNA damage patterns of males and females were compared (males are generally more sensitive than females to this and other toxins). Third, nursing mother mice were treated with two chemo-preventive agents in an attempt to determine if chemoprevention of the dam would lead to protection of her children. This thesis documents generation of a 48-hour time-course assessing adductburden in four-day-old B6C3F1 neonates. These burdens are measured in adducts per mega-base of genomic DNA (based on a single 6mg/kg dose of AFB₁). As previous studies show that 6mg/kg at this age results in near 100% liver tumorigenesis, this timecourse provides significant intuition for the onset and persistence of DNA damage. The results showed that AFB₁-N7-Guanine adduct formation maximized at two hours post dosing and then decreased rapidly; its FAPY derivative proved to be much more stable with time. A slight excess adduct burden was observed in males from 2-48 hours post dosing. Systematic differences in gene expression were observed in nursing female mother mice that were either treated or not with R,S-sulforaphane or D3T (3H-1,2- dithiole-3-thione). While minimal gene expression changes were observed in pups nursed by a 2mg R,S-sulforaphane treated dam, those nursing from a 5mg R,S-sulforaphane treated mother experienced much greater effects. At 300 umol/kg doses of D3T to the mother, no statistically significant gene expression profile alterations were observed in the pups. The work described here did not identify conditions in which a chemopreventive pattern of gene expression in the mother could be transferred efficiently to her offspring. ",

    "text": "A modeling framework and toolset for simulation and characterization of the cochlea within the auditory system Purpose: This research develops a modeling approach and an implementation toolset to simulate reticular lamina displacement in response to excitation at the ear canal and to characterize the cochlear system in the frequency domain. Scope The study develops existing physical models covering the outer, middle, and inner ears. The range of models are passive linear, active linear, and active nonlinear. These models are formulated as differential algebraic equations, and solved for impulse and tone excitations to determine responses. The solutions are mapped into tuning characteristics as a function of position within the cochlear partition. Objectives The central objective of simulation is to determine the characteristic frequency (CF)-space map, equivalent rectangular bandwidth (ERB), and sharpness of tuning (QERB) of the cochlea. The focus of this research is on getting accurate characteristics, with high time and space resolution. The study compares the simulation results to empirical measurements and to predictions of a model that utilizes filter theory and coherent reflection theory. Method We develop lumped and distributed physical models based on mechanical, acoustic, and electrical phenomena. The models are structured in the form of differential-algebraic equations (DAE), discretized in the space domain. This is in contrast to existing methods that solve a set of algebraic equations discretized in both space and time. The DAEs are solved using numerical differentiation formulas (NDFs) to compute the displacement of the reticular lamina and intermediate variables such as displacement of stapes in response to impulse and tone excitations at the ear canal. The inputs and outputs of the cochlear partition are utilized in determining its resonances and tuning characteristics. Transfer functions of the cochlear system with impulse excitation are calculated for passive and active linear models to determine resonance and tuning of the cochlear partition. Output characteristics are utilized for linear systems with tone excitation and for nonlinear models with stimuli of various amplitudes. Stability of the system is determined using generalized eigenvalues and the individual subsystems are stabilized based on their poles and zeros. Results The passive system has CF map ranging from 20 kHz at the base to 10 Hz at the apex of the cochlear partition, and has the strongest resonant frequency corresponding to that of the middle ear. The ERB is on the order of the CF, and the QERB is on the order of 1. The group delay decreases with CF which is in contradiction with findings from Stimulus Frequency Otoacoustic Emissions (SFOAE) experiments. The tuning characteristics of the middle ear correspond well to experimental observations. The stability of the system varies greatly with the choice of parameters, and number of space sections used for both the passive and active implementations. Implication Estimates of cochlear partition tuning based on solution of differential algebraic equations have better time and space resolution compared to existing methods that solve discretized set of equations. Domination of the resonance frequency of the reticular lamina by that of the middle ear rather than the resonant frequency of the cochlea at that position for the passive model is in contradiction with Bekesys measurements on human cadavers. Conclusion The methodology used in the thesis demonstrate the benefits of developing models and formulating the problem as differential-algebraic equations and solving it using the NDFs. Such an approach facilitates computation of responses and transfer functions simultaneously, studying stability of the system, and has good accuracy (controlled directly by error tolerance) and resolution.

Methods : Cartilage explants from calves were treated with (i)IL-1 (10 ng/ml), (ii)TNF[alpha] (100 ng/ml), (iii)Injurious compression (50% strain at 100%/sec) and IL-1[beta] (10 ng/ml) or (iv)Injurious compression (50% strain at 100%/sec) and TNF-[alpha](10 ng/ml), cultured for 5 days post treatment, and the pooled media collected, labeled with one of four iTRAQ labels and subjected to nano-2D-LC/MS/MS on a quadrupole time of flight instrument. Peptides were identified and quantified using Protein PilotTM, and MATLAB scripts used to obtain protein ratios. These results were analyzed using different statistical techniques. Data from two iTRAQ experiments were combined to generate data for all possible injury and cytokine treatment conditions, and proteins on which injury and cytokines acted synergistically identified. PLSR analysis was performed using Unscrambler®X software with the combined data set to determine which proteins are most relevant to some observed phenotypes. The phenotypes chosen were sGAG released to media in 5 days post treatment, proline and sulfate incorporation rates on day 6 post treatment, and nitrite accumulation in media in 5 days post treatment Results and Discussion: TNF-[alpha]+injury and IL-[beta] +injury treatment conditions show a very high correlation with each other. Most cytosolic, ER lumen and nuclear protein levels are highly elevated with both cytokine+injury conditions, while ECM proteins are either highly down regulated or marginally elevated. Many collagen telopeptides are down regulated, possibly indicating reduced anabolism. However, attempts at repair exist, as shown by increased levels of TGF-[beta] and activin A, and reduced levels of LTBP1. Also, biglycan and lumican, SLRPs known to be involved in early development are significantly increased, possibly indicating repair attempts. Other SLRPs such as PRELP and chondroadherin are also highly elevated, with one or both injury+cytokine treatments. While MMPs are mildly down regulated or remain the same, ADAMTS1 increases with TNF-a+injury, indicating increased catabolism. Among ECM structural proteins, COMP shows high down regulation with TNF-[alpha]+injury, possibly due to reduced synthesis. Proenkephalin, a signaling molecule possibly involved in tissue/repair and apoptosis, AIMPI, a multifunctional proapoptotic, inflammatory and pro-repair cytokine and Annexin A5, a protein indicating mineralization and apoptosis are all highly elevated with cytokine+injury indicating heightened apoptosis and/or repair. When results of two 4-plex iTRAQ experiments are combined to obtain data for all possible combinations of injury and cytokine, we again find a very high correlation between TNF-a+injury and IL-1 +injury (-95%), slightly higher than the correlation between TNF-[alpha] alone and IL-[beta] alone (-90%), and much higher than the correlation of either cytokine+injury condition with cytokine alone (-70%) or injury alone (-75%).

Left unrepaired, DNA damage can lead to premature aging, neurodegeneration and cancer. Humans have thus evolved intricate and widespread mechanisms to repair and manage this damage. These mechanisms-called the DNA damage response-often involve cell cycle arrest. Cell cycle arrest gives the cells precious extra time to utilize its diverse set of repair pathways. Among these is the homologous recombination pathway, which repairs DNA double-strand breaks. When the damage is deemed irreparable, a cell can choose to die: this allows for the maintenance of genomic integrity of the organism. Humans share 99.9% of the same genetic information. The remaining 0.1% is responsible for all genetic variations between individuals. This includes differences in disease susceptibility. In this study, we examined the inter-individual differences in the DNA damage response. To do so, we used a panel of twenty-four B lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from twenty-four healthy individuals of diverse ancestries. This panel had already been shown to display a broad range of sensitivity to several DNA damaging agents. We focused our attention on the alkylating agents temozolomide and methylnitronitrosoguanidine (MNNG). While MNNG has been extensively studied as a model DNA damaging drug, temozolomide is used in the clinic today to treat astrocytoma and glioblastomas. The two drugs are often referred to as functional analogues. We wanted to see if the cell lines' relative sensitivities to both drugs would be similar, which would support the analogy made between the drugs, or different, which would refute it. Furthermore, we measured the amounts of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) induced by temozolomide treatment to determine if the sensitivity measured by growth inhibition post-treatment was correlated with the amount of temozolomide-induced SCEs. For the cell lines tested, we found that the MNNG-induced sensitivity was similar to that induced by temozolomide. We also found a cell line in which temozolomide induced a large growth inhibition, all the while inducing no detectable SCEs. ",

This scheme utilizes recent findings on the mechanism of cisplatin, the drug found to cure in excess of 93% of all testicular cancer cases. Cisplatin forms DNA adducts that are toxic. The toxicity of these adducts is enhanced by the recruitment of proteins that bind to the adducts and impede adduct repair. This thesis was an attempt to duplicate this \"repair shielding\" mechanism with another cytotoxin. Specifically, this toxin will be programmed to kill breast cancer cells. Breast cancer cells often overexpress the estrogen receptor protein. By synthesizing a drug that not only binds and damages the DNA but also binds the abundant proteins in the cells, thereby blocking the damaged site from DNA repair proteins, a selective treatment of cancer cells can be achieved. In this study, the human estrogen receptor (hER) and the ligand binding domain of the hER genes were cloned into baculovirus expression vectors, establishing a system where a large quantity of the proteins can be expressed. The proteins expressed in insect cells were purified in one step, using the FLAG-epitope, yielding homogeneous proteins. The proteins were tested for binding to p-estradiol and were confirmed to be functional in ligand binding. They were also tested for their ability to bind the novel drugs synthesized to bind both the protein and the DNA. It was found that the ligand binding domain of the hER was capable of binding the drugs adducted to the DNA. In an effort to elucidate the mechanism of the protein-drug-DNA complex formation, an association experiment was carried out, which showed that the drug more readily bound to the protein than to DNA. However, a significant amount of the drug-protein complex still bound the DNA, if the ratio of the protein to the drug did not exceed 1.5. ",

The necessity for newer, more effective treatments for tuberculosis is growing, as the bacteria evolve resistance to traditional treatments. In an effort to develop more effective and perhaps more abbreviated courses of treatment, a plan was developed to investigate a pathway involved in cell wall biosynthesis as a promising target: the dTDP-L-rhamnose pathway. This pathway plays an essential role in linking the peptidoglycan and arabinogalactan portions of the mycolic acid-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex, a significant part of the mycobacterial cell wall. The mounting level of biochemical understanding of this pathway and its importance in bacterial cell wall biosynthesis indicates that it is not only a relevant target but also an accessible one. Of the four enzymes crucial to this biosynthetic pathway, one was chosen as the primary focus: dTDP-D-glucose-4,6- dehydratase (RmlB). There are 3 steps in the reaction mechanism of RmlB: oxidation of the C4 position of dTDP-D-glucose to form a 4-keto structure, dehydration of the C6 position via the elimination of water and a subsequent reduction to result in a 6-deoxy product. Crystal structures of this particular enzyme, dTDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase (RmlB), complexed with single substrates or substrate analogs have provided a foundation for these studies, enabling the rational design of a small library of potential inhibitors. Twelve mechanism-based inhibitors of RmlB are proposed. These compounds reflect the current understanding of the mechanism and mimic the sugar portion of the sugar-nucleotide substrate at various steps throughout the reaction mechanism. Each of the proposed inhibitors is designed to inhibit one of the specific steps of the mechanism. While the intention of this project is to synthesize each compound in this library from commercially available starting materials in 15 steps or less, the primary goal of this particular dissertation is to synthesize 3 of the 12 proposed inhibitors from the commercially available starting material 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol. The long term goal of this work is to produce these compounds in significant amounts in order to test their efficacy in an animal model of mycobacterial infection. ",

These commercially available prostheses are intrinsically controlled. Users cannot intuitively change ankle controller's behavior to perform movements that are not part of the repetitive walking gait cycle. For example, when transition from level ground walking to descending stairs, user cannot intuitively initiate or control the amount of ankle angle deflexion for a more normative stair descent gait pattern. This paper presents a hybrid controller that adds myoelectric control functionality to an existing intrinsic controller. The system employs input from both mechanical sensors on the ankle as well as myoelectric signals from gastrocnemius muscle of the user. This control scheme lets the user to modulate the gain of command ankle torque upon push off during level ground walking and stair ascent. It also allows the user to interrupt level ground walking control cycle and initiate ankle plantar flexion during stair descent. As a preliminary study, ankle characteristics such as ankle angle and torque were measured and compared to biological ankle characteristics. Results show that the proposed hybrid controller can maintain existing controller's biomimetic characteristics. In addition, it can also recognize to a qualitative extent the intended command torque for ankle push off and user's desire to switch between control modalities for different terrains. The study shows that it is possible and desirable to use neural signals as control signals for prosthetic leg controllers.

The causes of preterm birth are unknown, resulting in ineffective treatment, but it is correlated with ascension of vaginal bacteria through the cervix, which is normally protected by a dense mucus plug during pregnancy. This mucus plug, consisting of a tight meshwork of glycoproteins called mucins, should prevent pathogens from accessing the sterile uterine environment. Cervical mucus from women at high risk and low risk for preterm birth was collected and compared. The aim of this study was to discover differences that will lead to clues about why preterm birth occurs, and ultimately what can be done about it in terms of prevention and intervention. Using rheological techniques and a translocation assay, we found that cervical mucus from women at high risk is more translucent and more elastic under both elongational and shear stress, than cervical mucus in normal pregnancies. These properties more closely resemble mucus during ovulation, when spermatozoa can most easily penetrate the barrier, than mucus in normal pregnancy. Furthermore, high risk mucus is more permeable to beads of comparable size to viruses, suggesting the barrier is weakened and foreign particles may harmfully traverse it to cause intrauterine infection. The techniques in this paper have not been previously used to study cervical mucus in the context of preterm labor, but their results may have important implications. If these mucus properties in women indeed permit increased bacterial infection through the cervix, then they can be used to stratify patients, allowing for more personalized prenatal care to lower the rate of preterm birth.

    "text": "Developing osteoarthritis treatments through cartilage tissue engineering and molecular imaging Tissue engineering can be applied to develop therapeutic techniques for osteoarthritis, a degenerative disease caused by the progressive deterioration of cartilage in joints. An inherent goal in developing cartilage-replacement treatments is ensuring that tissue-engineered constructs possess the same properties as native cartilage tissue. Biochemical assays and imaging techniques can be used to study some of the main components of cartilage and assess the value of potential therapies. Agarose and self-assembling peptides have been used to make hydrogels for in vitro culture of bovine bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) which can differentiate into chondrocytes, undergo chondrogenesis, and produce cartilage tissue. So far, differences in cell morphology that characterize chondrogenesis had been observed in peptide hydrogels like KLD and RAD but not in the 2.0% agarose hydrogels typically used for culture. A tissue engineering study was conducted to determine if a suitable environment for cell proliferation and differentiation could be obtained using different agarose compositions. BMSCs were cultured in 0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.0% agarose hydrogels for 21 days following TGF-p1 supplementation. Results indicate that the 0.5% agarose hydrogels are clearly inferior scaffolds when compared to the 1.0% and 2.0% agarose hydrogels, which are generally comparable. Since agarose gels appear to be suboptimal in promoting chondrogenesis, self-assembling peptides should be used in future studies. In addition to the biochemical assays traditionally used in cartilage tissue engineering studies, atomic force microscopy (AFM) can be used to image aggrecan, one of the main components of cartilage. Imaging studies were carried out using fetal bovine epiphyseal aggrecan to optimize previous extraction and sample preparation procedures, as well as an AFM imaging protocol, for samples containing aggrecan. Experiments were conducted with 10, 25, and 50 ptg/mL aggrecan solutions to find the minimum concentration needed to create aggrecan monolayers on APTES-mica that would yield acceptable AFM images (25 [mu]g/mL). AFM instrument and software parameters were optimized to find the working range of the integral and proportional gains (0.2 - 0.4 and 0.6 - 0.8, respectively) and to increase the resolution, showing fields at the 800 nm level. Finally, an image processing protocol relevant to these molecules was established. ",

    "text": "Behavioral and genetic characteristics of intestinal cell lineages in health and disease The intestinal crypt is a highly dynamic system, as the entire epithelium is constantly turned over and renewed by the proliferative stem cells located at the bottom of the crypt. While this system is crucial for nutrient absorption, any derangements in the proliferative cells can quickly lead to cancer. In this thesis, we sought to better understand the behavioral and genetic characteristics of the different cell types along the intestinal crypt, in a mouse model. We first attempted to quantify the migration velocities and proliferative rates at a single-cell level using 5-ethynol-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) pulse-chase labeling. While we observed marked differences in the proliferation rates between the absorptive and secretory lineages (the former is faster), our experimental setup was unable to resolve any possible differences in migratory behaviors. We then turned our attention to quantifying the spatial expression patterns of selected transcripts in the intestinal crypt, both in wildtype and in an inducible APC-loss cancer model. We were able to show that the transcript expression profiles of key differentiation and proliferation markers (Creb313, Gob5, Ki-67, cMyc), as well as the ephrin signaling (EphB2 and EphrinBl) were significantly altered in the early stages (7 days) of adenoma formation. A more detailed analysis also separated this derangement in terms of extrinsic factors (e.g. altered cell composition along the crypt) and intrinsic factors (e.g. inherent change of cellular expression profile after APC loss). What is particularly interesting is that even differentiated cells in adenomas can exhibit such derangements. Our hypothesis to explain this observation is that these differentiated cells actually come from transformed stem cells. To test this hypothesis, we needed to verify that these cells indeed have excision at the Apc locus. After several approaches involving both single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the results were ultimately inconclusive. However, we propose several additional approaches that this hypothesis can be verified, and if verified, some biologically significant questions that can be addressed regarding the early dynamics of stem cells in intestinal cancer development.

Direct nerve Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) induces muscles to contract by electrically stimulating nerves, which shows promise for clinical applications in restoring muscle function in SC. However, Functional Electrical Stimulation is limited by the lack of graded response in muscle contraction and by high fatigability due to the reversal of recruitment order of motor units. Previous work showed that ion-selective membranes can be used to modulate Ca 2 ions in situ, decreasing the current threshold for nerve stimulation and eliciting a more graded muscle contraction response. This work developed polyimide-based cuff ion-selective electrodes to enable the future application of this technique in vivo. The developed electrodes were flexible, elastic and conductive. In vitro tests of the electrodes by stimulation of frog sciatic nerve reproduced the decrease in stimulation current threshold, which had been observed in planar glass-based electrodes, in the flexible polyimide-based electrodes. Additionally, cuffing the stimulated nerves with ion-selective electrodes was more effective at decreasing current threshold than planar stimulation. This work also analyzed data on twitch width, contraction time and relaxation time to infer effects of ion-selective electrodes on recruitment order. Stimulation with the ion-selective electrodes had higher twitch width, contraction time and relaxation time than traditional electrical stimulation at all force levels. The difference was particularly high at low force levels, indicating an effect of Calcium ion depletion on recruitment order. ",

Although cisplatin has proved efficacious in the treatment of various solid tumors, melanoma seems particularly resistant to this chemotherapeutic drug. Reports show that melanoma patients whose tumors express nitric oxide (NO) synthase and/or nitrotyrosine are often faced with poor prognosis. Moreover, it has been shown that NO produced by melanoma cells sustains lower sensitivity to cisplatin toxicity in vitro. Because inflammatory products such as NO and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are associated with the genesis and evolution of cancer, we hypothesized that these oxidative species may regulate key components of the response of melanoma to cisplatin. Using a system for controlled delivery of NO to simulate the NO levels believed to occur during inflammation, we showed that human melanoma (A375) cells pre-exposed to submicromolar NO concentrations were protected from a subsequent challenge with cisplatin. This protection was strongly associated with increased activity of the MAP-kinase cascade leading to activation of ERK1/2, as well as with downstream modulation of the apoptotic factors Bax and Bcl-2, and the transcription factors p53 and MiTF. Although NO favored increased expression and phosphorylation of p53, it also increased the expression of the p53 inhibitor MDM2, which may have counteracted p53-induced apoptosis upon cisplatin treatment. Also, likely via ERK1/2 activation, NO favored phosphorylation of MiTF, which is associated with survival signals. Furthermore, NO displayed the remarkable ability to overcome the effect of U0126, a MEK inhibitor, and promoted continuous phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (and hence cell survival), in contrast to cells not exposed to NO. Results also demonstrated that cisplatin-induced apoptosis was substantially decreased by the antioxidant precursor N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Unlike exogenous NO, cisplatin-induced ROS were linked to lower activation of ERK1/2, which was reversed by NAC. During the treatment with cisplatin, NAC led to lower levels of p53, which may have partially contributed to increased cell survival. However, in contrast to NO, NAC did not significantly alter the effects of cisplatin upon MiTF and apoptotic proteins studied. Altogether, our findings illustrate the complexity of the regulation of signaling components by oxidative species of distinct natures. ",

Insulin resistance is defined as the inability of cells and tissues to respond properly to ordinary amounts of insulin and is a precursor to many metabolic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Obesity, brought on in large part by caloric excess from high fat diet feeding, is a major contributor to insulin resistance. The recent drastic increase in the prevalence of obesity makes it imperative that steps are taken to more effectively treat and cure obesity-linked diseases such as diabetes. To identify optimal therapeutic targets, it is crucial to first gain a mechanistic understanding of obesity-induced insulin resistance, and understand how specific changes in the signaling network affect insulin sensitivity. Previous work has demonstrated that levels of SirT3, a mitochondrial protein deacetylase, are diet dependent. Additionally, SirT3 expression levels have been shown to mediate insulin and glucose tolerance in animals in a diet-dependent manner. Perturbations in SirT3 levels also alter the levels of phosphorylation on several canonical insulin signaling proteins. In my research, I further investigated the link between SirT3, diet and insulin resistance from a signaling network perspective. Using mouse liver as a model system, I analyzed liver tissue from mice fed a normal diet (insulin sensitive) or mice fed a high fat diet, thus inducing insulin resistance. Quantification of phenotypic and network events in response to insulin and utilization of computational techniques revealed activated pathways and nodes mediating insulin response, some of which had not been previously associated with the canonical insulin signaling network. I extended the study to analyze the role SirT3 plays in diet-mediated insulin sensitivity by perturbing the level of SirT3 in mice on both normal chow and high fat diets. The results of this research are useful for designing more efficacious therapies to treat insulin resistance-induced diseases. ",

These studies relate to the evolutionary process of normal tissue cells in an individual's organ from a normal stage to an initiated pre-neoplastic stage, and finally promoted to a neoplastic stage, resulting in tumorigenesis. The most significant impact of this type of research is to gain insight into the complex process of cancer development in humans. In the case of skin cancer, epidemiological and molecular data clearly indicate that sunlight is a carcinogen, the primary cause of skin cancer, in which forms of point mutation are associated with ultraviolet radiation. Furthermore, sunlight is attributed both as a tumor initiator and a tumor promoter by favoring the clonal expansion of p53 mutated cells. By utilizing studies of the multiple genetic hit model of oncomutation and inference that preneoplasia appears to be a clonal continuation of juvenile growth in adult tissues from which one stem cell creates an embryonic organ with lethal consequences, this thesis is devoted to the analysis of the process of skin cancer development and distribution of mutant cells in human skin, as well as the calculation of and inferences based on Gostjeva and Thilly's hypothesis on mutational clone frequency is restricted to the fetal-juvenile period.

We performed a comparative global gene expression study using data from morphologically identical stage-matched sorted populations of human and mouse erythroid precursors from early to late erythroblasts. Induction and repression of major transcriptional regulators of erythropoiesis, as well as major erythroid-important proteins, are largely conserved between the species. In contrast, at a global level we identified a significant extent of divergence between the species, both at comparable stages and in the transitions between stages, especially for the 500 most highly expressed genes during development. This suggests that the response of multiple developmentally regulated genes to key erythroid transcriptional regulators represents an important modification that has occurred in the course of erythroid evolution. In developing a systematic framework to understand and study conservation and divergence between human and mouse erythropoiesis, we show how mouse models can fail to mimic specific human diseases and provide predictions for translating findings from mouse models to potential therapies for human disease.

There is no approved vaccine to prevent this disease, and resistance to available antimalarial drugs is becoming widespread. Identification of parasite genes essential to survival and virulence could facilitate the development of novel therapeutics and vaccines. However, these efforts have been impeded by difficulties in manipulating the parasite's genome and functionally perturbing gene expression in a controlled way. Our lab has developed inducible systems to control P. falciparum gene expression, and has achieved successful editing of the P. falciparum genome using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. We have integrated these capabilities into a modular and scalable framework that can be used to efficiently edit, regulate and delete any target parasite gene after a single genome editing operation. This approach will accelerate studies of parasite gene function, and help prioritize potential drug and vaccine targets. A key requirement in this framework is the efficient assembly of donor vectors for modifying target loci and installing the necessary regulatory parts. This necessitates cloning several large, [A+T]-rich P.falciparum genomic regions that can be quite tedious and rate limiting. In this document, we show a new cloning strategy using linear vectors that facilitates rapid and accurate assembly of vectors capable of transforming P. falciparum. We present evidence of successful chromosomal modification of several genes via spontaneous single crossover, as well as zinc finger nuclease- and Cas9- mediated genome editing strategies using our assembled donor vectors. We also show that these modifications enable controllable expression of several previously uncharacterized genes to elicit phenotypes that we are investigating in further mechanistic detail. Importantly, these transgenic parasites can now be rapidly generated to allow identification of novel essential parasite genes in as little as a month. ",

These metakaryotic stem cells, after acquiring necessary genetic, and possibly other events, are also the stem cells of precancerous, cancerous and metastatic lesions of carcinogenesis. Furthermore, our lab has discovered that metakaryotic stem cells, both in fetal development and tumor growth, use a peculiar mode of DNA synthesis and segregation that involves inter alia expression of large amounts of RNA polymerase beta during DNA synthesis. It was hypothesized that an inhibitor of DNA polymerase beta would be toxic to metakaryotic stem cells at concentrations lower than necessary to kill eukaryotic non stem cells. The polymerase beta small-molecule inhibitor chosen for this study was pamoic acid, a napthoic acid derivative. With it we determined the relative sensitivity of metakaryotes and eukaryotic cells in the human colorectal cancer cell culture, HT- 29mes, that expresses characteristics expected of colorectal cancer metastases. We conclude that, at 300 [mu]M and above pamoic acid does not selectively kill metakaryotes in cell culture below that concentration which kills eukaryotes. Rather, pamoic acid acts in a similar fashion as X-rays: eukaryotic non-stem cells are killed at lower doses than those that kill metakaryotic stem cells. Treatment of pamoic acid with these concentrations causes concomitant declines in colony-formation potential for both metakaryotes and eukaryotes alike. At lower overall survival levels, surviving colonies appear to have arisen from metakaryotic cells, not eukaryotic cells as evidenced by the presence of visible metakaryotic cells in most colonies and the ability of such colonies to support continuous growth upon passaging. We conclude with the possibility that this specific polymerase beta inhibitor is not an effective metakaryocide in culture, insofar as they are not selectively toxic for these stem cells in the HT-29mes colorectal cancer cell line.

    "text": "Use Of synthetic solid scaffolds to mechanically support a chondrocyte-seeded peptide hydrogel for articular cartilage repair Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) is a subtype of OA associated with cartilage defects caused by traumatic joint injury. Because articular cartilage has a limited innate healing response, due to its avascular, aneural, and alymphatic nature, these defects lead to chronic degenerative joint disease if left untreated. Current treatments to repair articular cartilage generally result in fibrocartilage that is mechanically and biochemically inferior to native hyaline tissue. This has motivated the development of tissue engineering strategies for cartilage defect repair. Hydrogel approaches have shown promising results in their ability to induce chondrogenesis, proliferation, and cartilage-like matrix production, but are often very soft at early time points and at risk of damage from joint articulation. Solid scaffolds solve this mechanical problem, but often sacrifice bioactivity and integration with native tissue. In order to avoid the drawbacks of each of these approaches, we proposed a composite scaffold approach using a synthetic solid scaffold, made of bioabsorbable polyglycolic acid:trimethylene carbonate (PGA:TMC) or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), loaded with a chondrocyte-seeded self-assembling peptide hydrogel, [KLDL]₃. We hypothesized that these composite scaffolds would benefit from the mechanical protection of the solid scaffolds as well as the pro-chondrogenic and proliferative effects of the KLD hydrogel, allowing chondrocytes to produce cartilage-like extracellular matrix in a protected mechanical environment. To test the potential of these composite scaffolds for use in cartilage repair, we measured cell distribution, viability, matrix production and accumulation, and static and dynamic mechanical properties. We found that cells could be evenly distributed through at least one of the solid scaffolds tested, with all showing proliferation and maintenance of viability over four-week culture. Per-cell matrix production was an order of magnitude higher than in KLD hydrogels alone. Mechanical properties of composite scaffolds appeared to be dominated by the solid scaffolds, showing that they offered mechanical protection to the soft hydrogel within. Use in a cartilage defect model showed potential for integration with native tissue given optimization of gel-casting methods. Overall, our results show that these composite scaffolds are a viable tissue engineering strategy for articular cartilage repair. ",

In order to improve these treatments and engineer novel therapies, it is crucial that we increase our understanding of how these antibiotics interact with cellular metabolism. Evidence is increasingly building that the efficacy of antibiotics relies critically on downstream metabolic effects, in addition to inhibition of primary targets. Here we present a novel computational pipeline to expedite investigation of these effects: we combine computational modelling of metabolic networks with data from experimental screens on antibiotic susceptibility to identify metabolic vulnerabilities that can enhance antibiotic efficacy. This approach utilizes genome-scale metabolic models of bacterial metabolism to simulate the reaction-level response of cellular metabolism to a metabolite counter screen. The simulated results are then integrated with experimentally determined antibiotic sensitivity measurements using machine learning. Following integration, a mechanistic understanding of the phenotype-level antibiotic sensitivity results can be extracted. These mechanisms further support the role of metabolism in the mechanism of action of antibiotic lethality. Consistent with current understanding, application of the pipeline to M. tuberculosis identified cysteine metabolism, ATP synthase, and the citric acid cycle as key pathways in determining antibiotic efficacy. Additionally, roles for metabolism of aromatic amino acids and biosynthesis of polyprenoids were identified as pathways meriting further investigation. ",

    "text": "Computational modeling and simulation for projectile impact and indentation of biological tissues and polymers Understanding the elastic and viscoelastic responses of biological soft tissues and engineered polymer simulants is of great interest to predicting and preventing penetrative injuries. Detailed understanding of the mechanical processes at work could aid in the development and evaluation of protective strategies such as armor and helmets, and repair strategies including robotic surgery or needle-based drug delivery. However, due to the mechanical complexity of so-called \"soft tissues,\" including nonlinear viscoelastic behavior, surface adhesion, material failures and shock effects, the experimental characterization of various soft tissues is challenging and individual mechanical processes are often impossible to decouple without computational models and simulations. This thesis presents two finite element models designed to provide both replicate the results of indentation and impact experiments on synthetic polymers, aimed to decouple competing mechanical characteristics of contact based deformation. The first of these models describes the indentation on polydimethylsiloxane bilayer composites, with the aim of describing the relative effects of a adhesion and viscoelastic properties on the measured deformation response. That model expands on this objective via the analysis of the effects of surface adhesion commonly associated with highly compliant polymers and tissues. The second model attempts to replicate impact of a high velocity projectile on a relatively stiff material, polyurethane urea, and on a comparatively compliant polymer, gelatin hydrogel. These models provide means to simulate, predict and characterize material response, validated by comparison with available experiments. Such validated models can be used to simulate and design new materials as tissue simulants or as protective media that predictably dissipate concentrated mechanical impact. ",

A tissue-engineered liver for transplantation will require complex structures to support cell differentiation and integration with surrounding vasculature. Recent developments in 3D-printing (3DP™) technology allow the construction of such geometrically complex scaffolds out of biodegradable polymers. These artificial tissues should maintain healthy, functional hepatocytes in proper contact with supporting cell types in the context of proper flow cues. This project comprises three major efforts. First, the design and development of a 3D-printed scaffold, constructed of a porous biodegradable polymer matrix, for flow bioreactor culture. Second, the development of protocols for the production, preparation, and flow support of these scaffolds. And third, the employment of standard cell culture methodologies to test the ability of these scaffolds to support liver tissue cultures. Initial cell culture experiments showed similar rates of albumin production in the polymer disk scaffolds compared to cells in silicon-chip scaffolds under appropriately scaled flow conditions, indicating that the polymer scaffolds maintain functioning liver tissue. Further, histology sections of liver tissue grown on these polymer scaffolds show organization of cells into structures reminiscent of in vivo liver. The results of this study show that 3D-printed porous polymer scaffolds have great potential for use as biodegradable tissue culture support devices. It is believed that, combined with printing technologies now under development, the technologies developed in this thesis will help facilitate the construction of an implantable tissue engineered liver.

    "text": "Detection and characterization of rat hepatic stellate cells in a 3-dimensional, perfused, liver bioreactor One of the major challenges in liver research today lay in the understanding of the complex relationship between liver structure and function. The highly orchestrated events that take place in the liver to maintain homeostasis require the presence of all liver cell types. In vivo experiments offer only a snapshot of the liver, and usually involve perturbation of normal function through injury or experimental disease. The role of cell-cell interactions in maintaining normal liver function is far less understood than in pathological conditions. This may be because of the lack of methods in monitoring normal function in vivo. Culturing systems may capture pieces of the puzzle, but often capture only two cell types, and involve mediators presented to the cells in concentrations much higher than physiological values. In addition, the liver lobule contains a 3-dimensional metabolic zonation, and liver cell types comprise a heterogeneous population from the portal triad where the blood flows into the sinusoids to the central vein area where the blood flows out of the sinusoids. Liver cell types are dynamic responders to environmental cues from soluble factors to heterotypic cell interactions, to extracellular matrix proteins. Therefore, a system that serves to promote the health of all liver cell types through a 3-dimensional, perfused scaffold, and allows for self-organization of the liver cells in response to the engineered environment, would serve as a useful tool in understanding some of these complex, orchestrated events. In the research presented here, methods were developed to detect and characterize the heterogeneous population that makes up the hepatic stellate cell population inside the liver bioreactor (Griffith et. al).

Adult stem cells (ASC), which play the prime role in the maintenance and restoration of tissues, are thought to hold great potential for the advancement of medicine. It has been postulated that adult stem cells are able to retain \"immortal\" DNA template strands over successive generations by non-random chromosome co-segregation, and in so doing, to protect the long-term genomic fidelity of whole tissue compartments. The investigation of this theory may yield insights into areas such as the development of cancer and the process of aging. In addition, it may lead to the discovery of an effective method for the unique identification of adult stem cells, the study of which has thus far suffered from the lack of unique identifiers. Thus, the goal of this research was to develop an assay for the detection of immortal DNA strand co-segregation that could be applied to the detection and analysis of adult stem cells. It is proposed that such an assay may in itself serve as a unique identification method for adult stem cells. In this thesis, the development of such an assay is described. This assay, referred to as the label release assay, has provided further evidence for the existence of immortal strand co-segregation in model cell lines, and will potentially be useful in the study of adult stem cells in tissues.

This polymer has the unique properties of being cell resistant and chemically versatile such that various cell ligands can be coupled to its side chains. These properties allow adhesion through specific cell receptors to be studied without the effect of background adhesion to adsorbed proteins. By taking advantage of the ability to target specific receptors the comb polymer could be used as a powerful sorting tool. Sorting could be accomplished by finding cell type specific adhesion ligands. Several possible such ligands were screened. A ligand containing the tripeptide sequence RGD was found to elicit a strong cell adhesion response. However, this ligand is adherent to many cell types of the liver and would not be suitable for sorting purposes. Other cell type specific ligands tested showed little to no affinity for liver cell adhesion. Additionally, the comb was utilized to study α₅β₁ integrin-specific hepatocyte adhesion and the effect of Epidermal Growth Factor on adhesion. α₅β₁ integrin adhesion was mediated using a novel branched peptide, SynKRGD. This peptide consists of a linear peptide sequence containing RGDSP and the synergy site sequence PHSRN connected by the sequence GGKGGG. By utilizing the amine side group of Lysine a GGC branch was added. The terminal cysteine was used to conjugate SynKRGD to comb polymer surfaces using N-(p-Maleimidophenyl) isocyanate (PMPI) chemistry.

A variety of in vitro culture systems have been developed to address different aspects of liver physiology and architecture in order to recreate the microenvironment. These in vitro co-culture strategies have been limited by their inability to systematically characterize the addition of non-parenchymal cells. In this dissertation, I use gene expression levels quantified by real-time RT-PCR to determine tissue composition. The identified genes demonstrate significant cell-type specificity, magnitude, and stability of expression in vivo and throughout each step of cell isolation process. In the course of this development, we establish protocols to accurately isolate and count an enriched fraction of primary NPC's. Experiments on the perfusion and isolation process prove that there exists an inverse correlation between perfusion flow rate and NPC yield and viability. Further, we have characterized the tissue composition of each step in the cell isolation process and the resulting NPC population to confirm that a significant number of each NPC type is delivered to in vitro co-culture. System output analysis of spheroids co-cultured at physiological ratios and seeded into the milliF bioreactor shows the presence of stellate cells, but the absence of endothelial (EC) and kupffer cells (KC). The same analysis of 2D collagen gel sandwiches shows the presence of all NPC cell types.

Peptide structures in solution were studied with circular dichroism and dynamic light scattering, and material properties of the peptide solutions were studied with rheology. Nanofiber structure was studied through atomic force microscopy. Sonication was found to have a minimal effect on KLD12, while pH could alter the length of the fibers formed. The presence of a second type of peptide in solution interacted with nanofibers of another peptide and resulted in a decrease of average fiber length. Peptide solutions transitioned from a viscous solution to a gel as the concentration of peptide increased, both alone and in mixture with another peptide.

The field of tissue engineering and organ regeneration has been born out of the high demand for organ transplants. However, one of the critical limitations in regeneration of vital organs is the lack of an intrinsic blood supply. This work expands on the development of microfluidic scaffolds for vascular tissue engineering applications by employing microfabrication techniques. Unlike previous efforts, this work focuses on fabricating this scaffolds from poly(glycerol-sebacate) (PGS), a novel biodegradable elastomer with superior mechanical properties. The transport properties of oxygen and carbon dioxide in PGS were measured through a series of time-lag diffusion experiments. The results of these measurements were used to calculate a characteristic length scale for oxygen diffusion limits in PGS scaffolds. Microfluidic scaffolds were then produced using fabrication techniques specific for PGS. Initial efforts have resulted in solid PGS-based scaffolds with biomimetic fluid flow and capillary channels on the order of 10 microns in width. These scaffolds have also been seeded with endothelial cells and perfused continuously in culture for up to 14 days resulting in partially confluent channels. More complex fabrication techniques were also demonstrated. A novel electrodeposition technique was used in the fabrication of biomimetic microfluidic masters. Thin-walled devices were also synthesized to accommodate the relatively low gas permeability of PGS. ",

These cells come from the pre-implantation embryo, whose native environment is the hypoxic mammalian reproductive tract. Growing stem cells in an environment with higher oxygen levels (i.e. the atmospheric oxygen levels that are normally used to cultivate stem cells) could be bad for the cells, as oxygen is toxic due to its powerful oxidative capacity. In this experiment, J1 murine embryonic stem cells were grown at 0%, 2%, 5%, 10%, and 20% oxygen by volume to assess the effects that lower oxygen levels have on stem cell growth, plating efficiency, and metabolism. Two reaction vessels were built so that the cells could be grown in a controlled environment. Premixed gas cylinders were used to flush the vessels and an optical probe was used to measure the headspace oxygen concentration. Cells were found to grow faster than atmospheric conditions when in a moderately hypoxic environment where the oxygen concentration was between 2% and 10%, and considerably slower than atmospheric conditions as the headspace oxygen concentration approached zero. Maximum cell density decreased, glucose-lactate yield increased, glucose-cell yield decreased, and glutamine-cell yield decreased as headspace oxygen decreased. There were no strong correlations between oxygen concentration and glutamine-ammonia yield or plating efficiency. From the results of this study, it appears that it may be preferable to grow murine embryonic stem cells in a moderately hypoxic environment around 10% oxygen to increase the growth rate while minimizing the maximum cell density and metabolic inefficiency compromises.

In this research, an ES cell line with transfected green fluorescent protein (GFP) co-expressed by an Oct-4 promoter was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) to obtain such profile. As Oct-4 is an ES cell differentiation marker whose expression varies with pluripotency, GFP expression could simply be measured in these cells to determine how pluripotent they are as a population. The differentiation characterization of ES cells was also conducted with different culture conditions of reduced serum and glucose concentrations both in the presence and absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) which prevents spontaneous differentiation, as well as at varied LIF concentrations and seeding densities.

However, these applications are limited because of the difficulty in isolating and expanding pure populations of adult stem cells (ASCs). A major barrier to ASC expansion in vitro is their property of asymmetric cell kinetics. Our lab has developed a method, Suppression of Asymmetric Cell Kinetics (SACK), to expand ASCs in vitro by shifting their cell kinetics program from asymmetric to symmetric. We have found that guanine nucleotide precursors can be used to convert the kinetics of adult stem cells from asymmetric to symmetric, which promotes their exponential expansion. Previously, we have used the SACK method to derive hepatic and cholangiocyte stem cell strains from adult rat livers in vitro. These cell strains provide an assay to evaluate whether growth factors and cytokines previously implicated in proliferation of progenitor cells act by converting the kinetics of the stem cells in the population from asymmetric to symmetric, and thus identify new SACK agents.

Recently the incidence of IBD has been rising in Japan, Europe and North America.' Colorectal cancer is a very serious complication of IBD, and a patient's risk increases with increasing extent and duration of disease.2 There is no cure for CD, and the only cure for UC is removal of the entire colon and rectum. It is thought that cancer risk is based on chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal mucosa. There have been many studies, which have supported this idea and have made progress toward understanding the link between chronic inflammation and cancer. In both UC and CD, it is known that there are increased levels of EA, cG, and eC, which are potentially miscoding lesions, in the DNA of affected tissues.3 Also, 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase (Aag in mice), an initiator of the Base Excision Repair pathway, shows adaptively increasing activity in response to increased inflammation in UC colon epithelium.4 This thesis demonstrates the importance of Aag in protecting against the effects of chronic inflammation.

    "text": "A novel nanodelivery system for combination tumor therapy Anti-angiogenic therapy offers many benefits over traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy including fewer toxic side effects and the reduced development of drug resistance. Anti-angiogenics alone have not proven effective in inducing tumor regression in the clinic due to both the cytostatic nature of anti-angiogenic therapy and the potential formation of new regions of hypoxia within the tumor after therapy. The new therapeutic paradigm is for combining both anti-angiogenics and traditional cytotoxic agents for a synergistic effect. The efficacy of cytotoxic agents may be reduced after anti-angiogenic therapy, however, due to limited access to tumor vasculature and hypoxia-induced drug resistance. We propose that loading cytotoxic agents within the tumor prior to blood vessel collapse will enable both greater drug accumulation within the tumor as well as a reduction in the formation of therapy-induced regions of hypoxia. We present here a novel nanodelivery vehicle termed a 'nanocell' for the spatio-temporal recruitment of both anti-angiogenics and cytotoxic agents within the solid tumor to achieve this goal. Nanocells consist of a polymeric nanocore encapsulating the cytostatic agent doxorubicin surrounded by a lipid vesicle containing the anti-angiogenic agent combretastatin A4. ",

With the appropriate chemistry, such a bead can be attached to a single molecule as a handle, permitting the application of force on the single molecule. Measuring the force applied in real-time is dependent on detecting the bead's displacement from the trapping laser beam axis. Back-focal-plane detection provides a way of measuring the displacement, in two-dimensions, at nanometer or better resolution. The first part of this work will describe the design of a simple and inexpensive position sensing module customized for optical tweezers applications. Single molecule fluorescence is another powerful technique used to obtain microscopic details in biological systems. This technique can detect the arrival of a single molecule into a small volume of space or detect the conformational changes of a single molecule. Combining optical tweezers with single-molecule fluorescence so that one can apply forces on a single molecule while monitoring its effects via single molecule fluorescence provides an even more powerful experimental platform to perform such microscopic studies. Due to the enhanced photobleaching of fluorophores caused by the trapping laser, this combined technology has only been demonstrated under optimized conditions. ",

The DNA damage response results in one of several possible cell-fate decisions, or cellular responses: induction of cell-cycle arrest, initiation of DNA repair, activation of transcriptional programs, and either apoptosis, necrosis or cell senescence. The mechanisms by which cells make these decisions, and how cell fate depends upon variables such as DNA damage type and dose, and other environmental factors, is unknown. The process by which cells select among alternate fates following such stimuli, or \"cues\" is likely to involve a dynamic, multi-variate integration of signals from each of the kinase signaling components. A major goal of signal transduction research is to understand how information flows through signal transduction pathways downstream of a given cue, such as DNA damage, and how signals are integrated, in order to mediate cellular responses. Mathematical modeling approaches are necessary to advance our understanding of these processes. ",

This deformation has been shown to result in significant reductions in both the shear storage and shear loss moduli of the cell, with subsequent recovery towards their initial values. Also, deformation above a threshold stimulus results in neutrophil activation, evidenced by pseudopod projection from the cell. These two events are thought to occur via independent pathways, yet little is known about the mechanosensing signaling involved. Other work has demonstrated that physiological deformation of neutrophils induces a marked increase in the levels of cytosolic calcium, suggesting that this occurrence may trigger the biomechanical response observed in the cell.

The desire is to differentiate among diseased and healthy cells, cell age, and cell type with the minimum amount of sample pretreatment. This project addresses this need by developing microfluidic devices that exploit the adhesion differences between cell states and cell types to rapidly count cells of different types without the need for labels. There are two avenues in which to explore cell adhesion differences with these devices, the first is a net electrostatic change at the surface of the cell wall and the second is the presence of specific cell-membrane adhesion proteins. It is hypothesized that the forced interaction of the cell wall with the microfabricated microcapillary walls would result in a differential velocity based on cell type that could be detected simply using a microscope and video camera or an interferometer. The eventual integration of cell velocity detection would result in a portable all-inclusive lab-on-a-chip system that could be used in the field for detecting the presence of diseases, such as malaria and cancer as well as in a lab setting for drug discovery.

Wound healing experiments suggested that stimulatory signals travel through gap junctions containing connexin 43, while inhibitory signal travel through gap junctions containing connexin 37. Connexin 43 and connexin 37 inhibition, alone or in combination, reduced the levels of secreted latent TGF-[beta] in confluent PAEC monolayers after 24 hours of incubation. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) behaved in a similar manner. Inhibition of any one of the three connexins resulted in a marked increase in eNOS concentration. ",

Research currently involves mass screenings of different combinations of vector components without a true understanding of how each component interacts with the target cell. Few tools are currently available for scientists to quantitatively examine these vector-to-cell interactions or determine the rate limiting steps within the gene delivery pathway. Thus, researchers cannot fully optimize the vector design to reach maximal delivery efficiency. This project seeks to address this issue by modifying a density gradient electrophoresis (DGE) device originally developed on Mel Juso cells to segregate primary rat hepatocyte lysate into nuclear, early endosomal, late endosomal/lysosomal, and cytoplasmic fractions. We found that according to the Horseradish Peroxidase assay, late endosomes and lysosomes consistently localize to fractions 11-13 and early endosomes in fractions 18 to 21. There was minimal labeling in fractions 14 through 17 demonstrating that separation of the organelles was achieved. With this higher resolution fractionation, movement through the endosomal pathway can be studied in greater detail. ",

Recombinant protein subunits and peptides are relatively safe alternatives to live attenuated pathogens.

Studies with IGF-1: Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1) is a potent anabolic factor capable of endocrine and paracrine/autocrine signaling. Previous studies have demonstrated that mechanical compression can regulate the action of IGF-1 on chondrocyte biosynthesis in intact tissue; when applied simultaneously, these stimuli act by distinct cell activation pathways. Our objectives were to elucidate the extent and kinetics of the chondrocyte transcriptional response to combined IGF-1 and static compression in cartilage explants. Discussion: Clustering analysis revealed five distinct groups. TIMP-3 and ADAMTS-5, MMP-l and IGF-2, and IGF-1 and Collagen II, were all robustly co-expressed under all conditions tested. In comparing gene expression levels to previously measured aggrecan biosynthesis levels, aggrecan synthesis is shown to be transcriptionally regulated by IGF- 1, whereas inhibition of aggrecan synthesis by compression is not transcriptionally regulated.

Highly oxygen-demanding hepatocytes are commonly maintained under oxygen-deficient culture conditions, limited by culture medium thickness as well scaffold thickness. Thus, the cells are forced into anaerobic metabolic states that degenerate liver specific functions. Furthermore, cells separated from their extracellular matrix and disconnected from the synergistic interactions between other hepatic cells types further exacerbate hepatocellular function. This study aims to improve hepatospecific activity, especially CYP3A2 - a biomarker that is notoriously known to quickly lose expression in primary cultures, by creating a platform based on collagen sandwich cultures. The modified sandwich cultures are substituted with self-assembling peptide, RAD16-I, combined with integrin-binding sequence RGD or laminin receptor binding sequence YIGSR functional peptide motifs to create a cell-instructive peptide scaffold. To facilitate oxygen and nutrient diffusion and exchange, plasma modification technology is employed to control peptide layer dimension.

Human RefSeq exons obtained from the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser were analyzed for tissue-specific skipping. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were aligned to exons and their tissue of origin and histology were identified. ACEs were also identified as a subset of the skipped exons. About 18% of the exons were identified as tissue-specifically skipped in one of sixteen different tissues at four stringency levels. The different datasets were analyzed for both general features such as exon and intron length, splice site strength, base composition, conservation, modularity, and susceptibility to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay caused by skipping.

Diffusion Tensor Imaging was applied to the in vivo tongue of five subjects at rest to image the tongue myoarchitecture. The data revealed the complex relationships between extrinsic and intrinsic fibers.

Physiological strain rate data was acquired in 4 and 6 time point series during approximately 3 ml water bolus swallows. Data acquisition was gated to pressure from the tip of the tongue against the hard palate, indicating the beginning of the irreversible late accommodation.

After pathogen clearance, memory CD8+ T cells are generated, giving rise to long-term protection from reinfection. However, these cells are no longer detectable in the lung parenchyma six months post-infection, and cell-mediated immunity, and protection is lost. Knock-out studies in mice show that interleukin 15 (IL-15) is essential for memory CD8+ T cell proliferation. Fibroblasts, macrophages, dendritic cells and epithelial cells express IL-15 and its receptor isoform [alpha] (IL-15R[alpha]). Histological studies suggest that memory CD8+ T cells preferentially reside in peribronchiolar and perivascular areas, the stroma, of the lung.

The strength of integrin-ECM bonds has been noted to increase in response to the application of force. However, the strengthening of cadherin-cadherin bonds in response to force has not been studied. Here, we use magnetic trapping to probe adhesion strengthening at cadherin adherens junctions, using cadherin-coated magnetic beads to simulate neighboring cells and apply force at adherens junctions. 43% of beads exposed to a high force (2.1 nN) detached, compared to 31% of those exposed to a low-to-high force ramp followed by high force.

This background incorporates bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration along with inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor, interferon y, interleukin-1 a, interleukin-113, and interleukin-6) previously shown to increase in LPS-administrated rats. Our study began with an investigation of toxicities that are induced by combinations of five cytokines and LPS in HepG2 and C3A human hepatoma cell lines and in primary rat hepatocytes.

However, little is known about their detailed signal-response relationships. In this thesis, we sought to identify these potential signal-response relationships in RAW264.7 cells through systematic analysis. We first measured LPS stimulated dynamic signaling profiles over a range of an inhibitor of p38 MAPK, SB202190 concentrations for a distribution of kinases centrally involved in TLR-4 signaling network. We then applied quantitative analytical approaches to determine the most important signals or signal combinations contributing to induction of either IL-6 and TNF-ao secretion or apoptosis and construct their corresponding predictive mathematical models. Particularly, we found that the partial least squares regression (PLSR) models built using the ratio of phosphorylated Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) predicted LPS plus SB202190-induced apoptosis accurately even following perturbation with pharmacological inhibitors of JNK and ERK. Thus, by combining experimental and computational approaches, this thesis has proposed two new potential targets, JNK and ERK, for development of drug therapies against bacterial infection. ",

    "text": "The characterization of obesity and noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus in Swiss Webster mice associated with late-onset hepatocellular carcinoma Despite increased awareness of the obesity epidemic and a higher incidence of the metabolic syndrome in humans, the incidence of obesity and its comorbidities-most notably, type II diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD)-continues to increase. Although numerous animal models are available to study the molecular pathways, genetics and therapeutic/prevention strategies for T2D, no model completely recapitulates T2D or it's comorbidities in humans. Therefore, novel animal models represent valuable research tools in understanding T2D. To develop a novel mouse model of T2D, I characterized an outbred mouse discovered at MIT that displayed clinical signs of diabetes. Prevalence of glucosuria in the Swiss Webster colony reached 60% (n=70) in males 8 weeks to 6 months of age. Despite severe obesity in some females, no females were diabetic. Pathologic findings in affected males included cachexia, dilated gastrointestinal tracts with poor muscular tone, pancreatic islet degeneration and atrophy with compensatory metaplasia and/or neogenesis, bacterial pyelonephritis, membranous glomerulopathy, and late-onset hepatic tumors with macrosteatosis, microsteatosis and hydropic change in aged males. Serum insulin correlated with blood glucose in a nonlinear pattern suggestive of islet exhaustion. Circulating leptin levels showed a weak inverse correlation with glucose. Diabetic males were bred with obese colony females to produce 20 male and 20 female offspring. Prevalence of diabetes in male offspring was 80% (16/20) with a median age of onset of 18 weeks. In contrast, no diabetic females were identified, despite being significantly more obese than males. Male predominance is likewise a feature of T2D in humans. ",

Urology has emerged as a unique field in which minimally invasive implantation techniques are available and such devices could provide improved beneficial therapies over conventional treatments. Urological indications for which localized drug therapy is already being advocated and investigated are highly suitable for treatment with implantable controlled release devices. This thesis describes the in vitro performance evaluation of an implantable, bio-resorbable device that can provide localized drug therapy of ciprofloxacin (CIP) to the seminal vesicle and nearby prostate gland for treatment of chronic prostatitis (CP). The device functions as an elementary osmotic pump (EOP) to release CIP for a period of 2-3 weeks after implantation in the seminal vesicle (SV) through transrectal needle injection or cystoscopic methods. The device is composed of an elastomeric, resorbable polymer cast in a tubular geometry with solid drug powder packed into its core and a micromachined release orifice drilled through its wall. Drug release experiments were performed to determine the effective release rate from a single orifice and the range of orifice size in which osmotic-controlled zero-order release was the dominant mechanism of drug delivery from the device. Device stability and function in an alkaline environment of similar pH to that of the SVs and infected prostate gland was also assessed in vitro. The device was found to function well in both de-ionized water and NaOH pH-8 solution with a sustained zero-order release rate of 2.47 ± 0.29 jtg/hr when fabricated with an orifice of diameter 100-150pm.

    "text": "Multi-scale analysis of cardiac myoarchitecture The distribution and generation of force within the myocardium during normal contractility is dictated by the tissue's underlying 3D myoarchitecture. The presence of disordered myoarchitecture may in turn constitute the pathological basis of impaired cardiac mechanics in numerous clinical conditions, such as the remodeling heart following myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathies. To investigate the multi-scale nature of architectural disarray in the setting of myocardial disease, a dual imaging approach consisting of diffusion spectrum magnetic resonance imaging (DSI) and high-speed multislice two-photon microscopy (TPM) was used. DSI is a technique that derives fiber orientation from directionality of proton diffusion, whereas TPM derives cellular alignment from an autocorrelation of 3D resolved images of cells and subcellular structure. Mesoscale tract representations of myofiber orientation are generated from similarly aligned diffusion or autocorrelation vectors. These methods were applied to study induced myocardial infarction in the rat and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated with deletion of the gene for myosin binding protein C (cMyBP-C) in the mouse. Normal cardiac muscle fiber alignment within the ventricular wall was characterized by a series of helical tracts transitioning from a lefthanded orientation in the subepicardium to circumferential in the mid-myocardium to righthanded in the subendocardium. Infarcted hearts displayed a fiber void in the infarct zone and an extension of both subepicardial and subendocardial fibers beyond the border zone. It's hypothesized that the growth of fibers contributes to the remodeling process and provides tensile strength to the myocardium during contraction. ",

Here we report the computational design and experimental validation of two mutant erythropoietin receptors: one that binds only to erythropoietin site 1 but not site 2, and one that binds only to site 2 but not site 1. Expression of either mutant receptor alone in Ba/F3 cells cannot elicit a signal in response to erythropoietin, but when co-expressed, there is a proliferative response and activation of the JAK2 Stat5 signaling pathway. A truncated erythropoietin receptor with only one cytosolic tyrosine (Y343), on only one receptor monomer is sufficient for signaling in response to erythropoietin, regardless of the monomer on which it is located. The same results apply to having only one conserved juxtamembrane hydrophobic L253 or W258 residue, essential for JAK2 activation, in the full-length receptor dimer. We conclude that despite asymmetry in the ligand-receptor dimer interaction, both sides are competent for signaling, and we suggest that the receptors signal equally. ",

In order to do this, we conducted a 3-day Value Stream Mapping workshop, during which we generated a map of the present value stream. We identified shortcomings and inefficiencies within this value stream, and then mapped out a future state Value Stream, creating a 90-day action plan to move towards that desired future state. This action plan relied heavily upon measuring and improving key performance indicators, which allowed us to make objective measures of our progress. A second internship objective was to reduce the number of clean room re-sanitizations. Currently, clean rooms undergo a costly and time-consuming re-sanitization whenever an air handler is shut down for a brief period of time. It is likely that some of these cleanings are unnecessary, and eliminating extraneous cleanings could reduce maintenance costs significantly. In order to reduce unnecessary clean room re-sanitizations, we designed and conducted a study to measure environmental standards during an air handler shutdown. Genzyme's Validation and Quality Control Departments approved this experimental plan prior to execution. We shut down an air handler that supplied a clean room, and monitored the air for viable and non-viable particles for several hours. Viable particulate levels did not exceed action limits during a four-hour shutdown, and non-viable particulates dropped to pre-experiment levels as soon as we re-started the air handler. Based on these results, we conclude that air-handler shutdowns should not require room re-sanitization. ",

    "text": "Cell and nanomaterial-based approaches for diagnosis and chemotherapy of metastatic cancer cells Metastasis is a multistep process during which tumor cells separate from a primary tumor, penetrate the bloodstream, evade host defenses, and colonize distant organs. This final and fatal step in tumor development is the cause of more than 90% of cancer related deaths. Therapies and diagnostics can be targeted to metastasis at three points in its progression: the primary tumor, the secondary tumor, and circulating tumor cells (CTCs). While much work has focused on primary tumors, less effort has concentrated on targeted isolation, detection and therapy of deeply penetrated metastases and CTCs. Here, I discuss cell and nanomaterial-based approaches for detecting and ablating these malignant populations. The number of CTCs in the blood directly correlates with disease progression; however, the lack of definitive markers has limited their isolation and characterization. I have demonstrated the potential use of platelets as a cell-based marker for isolation and detection of CTCs. Using phage display technology, it was possible to identify candidate peptides specific to mesenchymal-like tumor cells that may mimic the motile and aggressive CTC population. In order to detect and ablate metastases and CTCs, M13 bacteriophage was engineered into a platform for simultaneous tumor targeting, imaging, and therapy. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and doxorubicin, a chemotherapeutic agent, were loaded on phage for fluorescent near-infrared imaging and cytotoxicity of metastatic lesions, respectively. The near-infrared optical properties of SWNTs in the \"second window\" make them promising candidates for imaging nascent and deeply seeded tumors. This approach provides an 'all-in-one' platform for targeted fluorescence imaging and efficient drug delivery and may allow for real-time monitoring of tumor response to drug regimens. ",

    "text": "Development and application of tools for glycan characterization Glycans are essential components of all living things because they function as key elements of cellular membranes and extracellular spaces by mediating cell-cell communication, transduction pathways, and cellular development, function, and survival. Because glycans are secondary gene products that depend on the availability of sub-cellular enzymes for synthesis, research on their structure, synthesis, and biological significance has lagged behind that of DNA and proteins due to both a lack of appreciation of their importance and the slow pace at which tools are being developed to study them. In this thesis, three projects focus on the development, application, and exploration of tools for glycan characterization. The first project resulted in the successful optimization of an analytical method to isolate and characterize O-linked glycans, on which relatively few research projects focus because of the limited availability of tools to isolate them and the need for specific analytical equipment to properly characterize them. Using this optimized method, the O-linked glycans of bovine mucin and fetuin were successfully profiled, and the analysis of the former provided the motivation for a second project focused on the significance of goblet cells and mucins in influenza infection. This project explored the potential benefits of a glycoprotein direct binding assay as a way to obtain quantitative information about lectin and influenza hemagglutinin specificities. Using mucins adsorbed to a polystyrene plate, it was possible to obtain quantitative binding constants for two commonly used lectins. The last project focused on the isolation and characterization of the cell surface N-linked glycans from chicken erythrocytes, turkey erythrocytes, and human tracheal epithelial (HTE) cells. Analysis of these cell types is warranted due to their importance as model systems to study influenza infection. The results of this project provide a context for future questions about the relevance of the erythrocyte model system for studying influenza binding specificities. All of these projects reiterate the importance of the study of glycobiology by showing how both the development and application of tools to study glycans can provide in new and interesting information about pathological processes related to human health and disease.

These photosynthetic organisms play a major role in the global carbon cycle. They have adapted to a number of different temperature, light, and nutrient niches. However, as important primary producers in the oceans, these organisms play a vital role which may be threatened by global climate change and pollution. As research on cyanobacterial species progresses, these organisms have been found to show promise as potential sources of biofuel, renewable energy, and agents for bioremediation. In order to utilize these organisms for future engineering applications and basic scientific research, it is important to be able to grow the organism in a stable and reproducible manner. This research characterizes the growth of Synechococcus WH8109 in the laboratory. In the laboratory, cell culture densities of greater than 109 cells/mL with a doubling time of approximately 24 hours were achieved when grown at 28'C with a 24 hour light cycle in sea water and artificial salt water media. Not only did cyanobacteria evolve long before their distant enteric cousins, but they harness nearly all of their energy through photosynthesis. The photosystem is constantly subjected to photo-oxidative damage and degradation. Interesting insight may be gained by studying this complex repair process in the bacterial counterpart to plants, prior to applying these concepts to higher order plant species. Chaperones have been implicated in this repair process. In order to better characterize the stress response of WH8109, I have also isolated the Synechococcus homologue of GroEL using anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography and sucrose gradient centrifugation. The expression levels of this chaperone were analyzed under normal and stress conditions and they have been shown to respond to heat shock and infection. ",

    "text": "Process Improvement in Biotech : Dealing with High Complexity Processes Across numerous conventional manufacturing sites, process improvement initiatives have been shown to increase production capabilities while decreasing costs - all without a required system- wide overhaul of the manufacturing site. For the biotech industry, this presents an interesting challenge. Through its upbringings as a highly interdisciplinary field, manufacturing unique biologics poses new and complex barriers to a process improvement initiative. However, though the challenge is daunting, process improvement in this field will in fact increase the reward two-fold. First, as with conventional manufacturing sites, costs and lead times will decrease while potentially increasing profits. Second, the ability to better produce more life improving drugs, and at a more affordable price to patients is in fact a reward unto itself - one that is at the forefront of Genzyme's culture. The turnaround process, where the manufacturing of biologics is halted in order to maintain a key manufacturing process, is a critical point in the production of biologics. The ability to reduce the time and variability of this process will directly and significantly increase Genzyme's manufacturing capacity. Currently, this turnaround process takes approximately 8±1 days, and it is hoped that it will be possible to attain a new turnaround time of 6±1 days through a number of process improvement methodologies such as lean manufacturing. The effects of implementation of a number of lean tools such as standardized workflow, visual management and an automation of the pressure-hold test were studied here. Our observations reveal that by introducing lean methodology the communication and coordination around the complex turnaround process improved, which led to a more manageable and repeatable process. By automating the pressure-hold test it will be possible to significantly reduce the test time and free up resources to perform additional turnaround activities. Even with these preliminary results, it is clear that the path to process improvement at Genzyme is possible, though not without its inherent difficulties. This work provides a critical framework for a number of techniques used, and serves as a case study in understanding the underlying rewards and difficulties with process improvement in the biotech industry.

Key to the understanding of the fundamental principles and designs by which molecular motor function has been the kinesin family. Missing, however, is a clear understanding of the series of events that take place at the atomistic level when kinesin walks on a microtubule and generates force. Recent MD simulations have identified the force-generating mechanism in kinesin, the cover-neck bundle, and strongly suggest that the formation of the CNB by the N-terminal cover strand and the C-terminal neck linker of the motor head are responsible for force generation. In this thesis we present tools developed in the Lang Laboratory to further elucidate the stepping motion and force generation mechanism of kinesin using Drosophila kinesin as a model system. We demonstrate the function of a force clamp specifically designed for the laboratory and show traces of WT kinesin walking under constant load. We also purified and tested kinesin mutants running under a force load. We present two assays specifically designed to study the interaction between kinesin and the last 10-18 C-terminal residues of a-p tubulin, the E-hook. We were unable to observe kinesin - e-hook interactions, such as those suggested by the formation of tethers, when the e-hook was bound to the surface. In the case of e-hook in solution, our results indicate that 2G kinesin was still functional and its stall force approximately 3 pN just as for the case when no e-hook is present. We also propose ways that the work in this thesis can be expanded. The force clamp can be easily adapted to study novel kinesin mutants under constant load in 2D. In addition, the force clamp can be used to probe the kinesin - e-hook interactions by looking at kinesin walking over microtubules with cleaved e-hooks. The e-hook assays presented in this thesis can also be expanded to include higher concentrations of e-hook or be performed using labeled e-hook to assess single molecule interactions and concentrations.

    "text": "A new mouse model to probe the role of aflatoxin B₁ in liver carcinogenesis One and a half million new cancer cases are reported each year in the United States. Despite this overwhelming burden of disease, current preventative treatments and early detection techniques are inadequate. With cancers, as with many aggressive diseases, time is of the essence; earlier detection begets better patient prognoses. While contemporary technology offers physicians the ability to battle cancers via stage-one detection, few reliable biomarkers have been developed to assist in detection of upstream tumorigenesis or interpretation of early genomic assault. The objective of the work described here is to identify early biomarkers specific to tumorigenesis, which correlate with initial genomic assault and subsequent mutation in the gpt-delta (B6C3F1) mouse model. The test compound used in this work is aflatoxin B₁, a known human carcinogen produced by fungal spoilage of food materials. Aflatoxin B₁ was one of the carcinogens used in the \"training set\" of compounds that defined the B6C3F1 animal model. My work had three goals with regard to upgrading this model as a tool for contemporary toxicology. In the first part of the thesis, a kinetic profile was generated of AFB 1-DNA adduct formation and removal. In the second part of the work, adduct levels and specific DNA damage patterns of males and females were compared (males are generally more sensitive than females to this and other toxins). Third, nursing mother mice were treated with two chemo-preventive agents in an attempt to determine if chemoprevention of the dam would lead to protection of her children. This thesis documents generation of a 48-hour time-course assessing adductburden in four-day-old B6C3F1 neonates. These burdens are measured in adducts per mega-base of genomic DNA (based on a single 6mg/kg dose of AFB₁). As previous studies show that 6mg/kg at this age results in near 100% liver tumorigenesis, this timecourse provides significant intuition for the onset and persistence of DNA damage. The results showed that AFB₁-N7-Guanine adduct formation maximized at two hours post dosing and then decreased rapidly; its FAPY derivative proved to be much more stable with time. A slight excess adduct burden was observed in males from 2-48 hours post dosing. Systematic differences in gene expression were observed in nursing female mother mice that were either treated or not with R,S-sulforaphane or D3T (3H-1,2- dithiole-3-thione). While minimal gene expression changes were observed in pups nursed by a 2mg R,S-sulforaphane treated dam, those nursing from a 5mg R,S-sulforaphane treated mother experienced much greater effects. At 300 umol/kg doses of D3T to the mother, no statistically significant gene expression profile alterations were observed in the pups. The work described here did not identify conditions in which a chemopreventive pattern of gene expression in the mother could be transferred efficiently to her offspring. ",

    "text": "A modeling framework and toolset for simulation and characterization of the cochlea within the auditory system Purpose: This research develops a modeling approach and an implementation toolset to simulate reticular lamina displacement in response to excitation at the ear canal and to characterize the cochlear system in the frequency domain. Scope The study develops existing physical models covering the outer, middle, and inner ears. The range of models are passive linear, active linear, and active nonlinear. These models are formulated as differential algebraic equations, and solved for impulse and tone excitations to determine responses. The solutions are mapped into tuning characteristics as a function of position within the cochlear partition. Objectives The central objective of simulation is to determine the characteristic frequency (CF)-space map, equivalent rectangular bandwidth (ERB), and sharpness of tuning (QERB) of the cochlea. The focus of this research is on getting accurate characteristics, with high time and space resolution. The study compares the simulation results to empirical measurements and to predictions of a model that utilizes filter theory and coherent reflection theory. Method We develop lumped and distributed physical models based on mechanical, acoustic, and electrical phenomena. The models are structured in the form of differential-algebraic equations (DAE), discretized in the space domain. This is in contrast to existing methods that solve a set of algebraic equations discretized in both space and time. The DAEs are solved using numerical differentiation formulas (NDFs) to compute the displacement of the reticular lamina and intermediate variables such as displacement of stapes in response to impulse and tone excitations at the ear canal. The inputs and outputs of the cochlear partition are utilized in determining its resonances and tuning characteristics. Transfer functions of the cochlear system with impulse excitation are calculated for passive and active linear models to determine resonance and tuning of the cochlear partition. Output characteristics are utilized for linear systems with tone excitation and for nonlinear models with stimuli of various amplitudes. Stability of the system is determined using generalized eigenvalues and the individual subsystems are stabilized based on their poles and zeros. Results The passive system has CF map ranging from 20 kHz at the base to 10 Hz at the apex of the cochlear partition, and has the strongest resonant frequency corresponding to that of the middle ear. The ERB is on the order of the CF, and the QERB is on the order of 1. The group delay decreases with CF which is in contradiction with findings from Stimulus Frequency Otoacoustic Emissions (SFOAE) experiments. The tuning characteristics of the middle ear correspond well to experimental observations. The stability of the system varies greatly with the choice of parameters, and number of space sections used for both the passive and active implementations. Implication Estimates of cochlear partition tuning based on solution of differential algebraic equations have better time and space resolution compared to existing methods that solve discretized set of equations. Domination of the resonance frequency of the reticular lamina by that of the middle ear rather than the resonant frequency of the cochlea at that position for the passive model is in contradiction with Bekesys measurements on human cadavers. Conclusion The methodology used in the thesis demonstrate the benefits of developing models and formulating the problem as differential-algebraic equations and solving it using the NDFs. Such an approach facilitates computation of responses and transfer functions simultaneously, studying stability of the system, and has good accuracy (controlled directly by error tolerance) and resolution.

Methods : Cartilage explants from calves were treated with (i)IL-1 (10 ng/ml), (ii)TNF[alpha] (100 ng/ml), (iii)Injurious compression (50% strain at 100%/sec) and IL-1[beta] (10 ng/ml) or (iv)Injurious compression (50% strain at 100%/sec) and TNF-[alpha](10 ng/ml), cultured for 5 days post treatment, and the pooled media collected, labeled with one of four iTRAQ labels and subjected to nano-2D-LC/MS/MS on a quadrupole time of flight instrument. Peptides were identified and quantified using Protein PilotTM, and MATLAB scripts used to obtain protein ratios. These results were analyzed using different statistical techniques. Data from two iTRAQ experiments were combined to generate data for all possible injury and cytokine treatment conditions, and proteins on which injury and cytokines acted synergistically identified. PLSR analysis was performed using Unscrambler®X software with the combined data set to determine which proteins are most relevant to some observed phenotypes. The phenotypes chosen were sGAG released to media in 5 days post treatment, proline and sulfate incorporation rates on day 6 post treatment, and nitrite accumulation in media in 5 days post treatment Results and Discussion: TNF-[alpha]+injury and IL-[beta] +injury treatment conditions show a very high correlation with each other. Most cytosolic, ER lumen and nuclear protein levels are highly elevated with both cytokine+injury conditions, while ECM proteins are either highly down regulated or marginally elevated. Many collagen telopeptides are down regulated, possibly indicating reduced anabolism. However, attempts at repair exist, as shown by increased levels of TGF-[beta] and activin A, and reduced levels of LTBP1. Also, biglycan and lumican, SLRPs known to be involved in early development are significantly increased, possibly indicating repair attempts. Other SLRPs such as PRELP and chondroadherin are also highly elevated, with one or both injury+cytokine treatments. While MMPs are mildly down regulated or remain the same, ADAMTS1 increases with TNF-a+injury, indicating increased catabolism. Among ECM structural proteins, COMP shows high down regulation with TNF-[alpha]+injury, possibly due to reduced synthesis. Proenkephalin, a signaling molecule possibly involved in tissue/repair and apoptosis, AIMPI, a multifunctional proapoptotic, inflammatory and pro-repair cytokine and Annexin A5, a protein indicating mineralization and apoptosis are all highly elevated with cytokine+injury indicating heightened apoptosis and/or repair. When results of two 4-plex iTRAQ experiments are combined to obtain data for all possible combinations of injury and cytokine, we again find a very high correlation between TNF-a+injury and IL-1 +injury (-95%), slightly higher than the correlation between TNF-[alpha] alone and IL-[beta] alone (-90%), and much higher than the correlation of either cytokine+injury condition with cytokine alone (-70%) or injury alone (-75%).

SWNT have potential as biosensors because of extraordinary sensitivity, lack of photobleaching, and optical activity in a near-infrared window. A SWNT sensor could provide label-free measurements of antibody concentration in a continuous fashion, which may aid selection of production strains. Protein A itself, dextran, poly vinyl alcohol, DNA sequences, and chitosan were used as polymers for wrapping SWNT. Nonspecific binding to solution-phase constructs was found to be a major problem with these approaches. Chitosan hydrogels encapsulating SWNT also show nonspecific responses. ",

    "text": "A study of inter-individual differences in the DNA damage response Agents that damage our DNA are omnipresent in our environment and inside our cells themselves. Left unrepaired, DNA damage can lead to premature aging, neurodegeneration and cancer. Humans have thus evolved intricate and widespread mechanisms to repair and manage this damage. These mechanisms-called the DNA damage response-often involve cell cycle arrest. Cell cycle arrest gives the cells precious extra time to utilize its diverse set of repair pathways. Among these is the homologous recombination pathway, which repairs DNA double-strand breaks. When the damage is deemed irreparable, a cell can choose to die: this allows for the maintenance of genomic integrity of the organism. Humans share 99.9% of the same genetic information. The remaining 0.1% is responsible for all genetic variations between individuals. This includes differences in disease susceptibility. In this study, we examined the inter-individual differences in the DNA damage response. To do so, we used a panel of twenty-four B lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from twenty-four healthy individuals of diverse ancestries. This panel had already been shown to display a broad range of sensitivity to several DNA damaging agents. We focused our attention on the alkylating agents temozolomide and methylnitronitrosoguanidine (MNNG). While MNNG has been extensively studied as a model DNA damaging drug, temozolomide is used in the clinic today to treat astrocytoma and glioblastomas. The two drugs are often referred to as functional analogues. We wanted to see if the cell lines' relative sensitivities to both drugs would be similar, which would support the analogy made between the drugs, or different, which would refute it. Furthermore, we measured the amounts of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) induced by temozolomide treatment to determine if the sensitivity measured by growth inhibition post-treatment was correlated with the amount of temozolomide-induced SCEs. For the cell lines tested, we found that the MNNG-induced sensitivity was similar to that induced by temozolomide. We also found a cell line in which temozolomide induced a large growth inhibition, all the while inducing no detectable SCEs. ",

    "text": "Molecular mechanism of interactions between estrogen receptor and estrogen receptor selective genotoxins Although one million new breast cancer cases arise each year worldwide, therapies to treat the disease are limited. Conventional treatments including the chemotherapeutic agent, Tamoxifen, have had only limited success, often showing uncomfortable side effects. Our group has proposed a new scheme for a rational drug design. This scheme utilizes recent findings on the mechanism of cisplatin, the drug found to cure in excess of 93% of all testicular cancer cases. Cisplatin forms DNA adducts that are toxic. The toxicity of these adducts is enhanced by the recruitment of proteins that bind to the adducts and impede adduct repair. This thesis was an attempt to duplicate this \"repair shielding\" mechanism with another cytotoxin. Specifically, this toxin will be programmed to kill breast cancer cells. Breast cancer cells often overexpress the estrogen receptor protein. By synthesizing a drug that not only binds and damages the DNA but also binds the abundant proteins in the cells, thereby blocking the damaged site from DNA repair proteins, a selective treatment of cancer cells can be achieved. In this study, the human estrogen receptor (hER) and the ligand binding domain of the hER genes were cloned into baculovirus expression vectors, establishing a system where a large quantity of the proteins can be expressed. The proteins expressed in insect cells were purified in one step, using the FLAG-epitope, yielding homogeneous proteins. The proteins were tested for binding to p-estradiol and were confirmed to be functional in ligand binding. They were also tested for their ability to bind the novel drugs synthesized to bind both the protein and the DNA. It was found that the ligand binding domain of the hER was capable of binding the drugs adducted to the DNA. In an effort to elucidate the mechanism of the protein-drug-DNA complex formation, an association experiment was carried out, which showed that the drug more readily bound to the protein than to DNA. However, a significant amount of the drug-protein complex still bound the DNA, if the ratio of the protein to the drug did not exceed 1.5. ",

The necessity for newer, more effective treatments for tuberculosis is growing, as the bacteria evolve resistance to traditional treatments. In an effort to develop more effective and perhaps more abbreviated courses of treatment, a plan was developed to investigate a pathway involved in cell wall biosynthesis as a promising target: the dTDP-L-rhamnose pathway. This pathway plays an essential role in linking the peptidoglycan and arabinogalactan portions of the mycolic acid-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex, a significant part of the mycobacterial cell wall. The mounting level of biochemical understanding of this pathway and its importance in bacterial cell wall biosynthesis indicates that it is not only a relevant target but also an accessible one. Of the four enzymes crucial to this biosynthetic pathway, one was chosen as the primary focus: dTDP-D-glucose-4,6- dehydratase (RmlB). There are 3 steps in the reaction mechanism of RmlB: oxidation of the C4 position of dTDP-D-glucose to form a 4-keto structure, dehydration of the C6 position via the elimination of water and a subsequent reduction to result in a 6-deoxy product. Crystal structures of this particular enzyme, dTDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase (RmlB), complexed with single substrates or substrate analogs have provided a foundation for these studies, enabling the rational design of a small library of potential inhibitors. Twelve mechanism-based inhibitors of RmlB are proposed. These compounds reflect the current understanding of the mechanism and mimic the sugar portion of the sugar-nucleotide substrate at various steps throughout the reaction mechanism. Each of the proposed inhibitors is designed to inhibit one of the specific steps of the mechanism. While the intention of this project is to synthesize each compound in this library from commercially available starting materials in 15 steps or less, the primary goal of this particular dissertation is to synthesize 3 of the 12 proposed inhibitors from the commercially available starting material 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol. The long term goal of this work is to produce these compounds in significant amounts in order to test their efficacy in an animal model of mycobacterial infection. ",

These commercially available prostheses are intrinsically controlled. Users cannot intuitively change ankle controller's behavior to perform movements that are not part of the repetitive walking gait cycle. For example, when transition from level ground walking to descending stairs, user cannot intuitively initiate or control the amount of ankle angle deflexion for a more normative stair descent gait pattern. This paper presents a hybrid controller that adds myoelectric control functionality to an existing intrinsic controller. The system employs input from both mechanical sensors on the ankle as well as myoelectric signals from gastrocnemius muscle of the user. This control scheme lets the user to modulate the gain of command ankle torque upon push off during level ground walking and stair ascent. It also allows the user to interrupt level ground walking control cycle and initiate ankle plantar flexion during stair descent. As a preliminary study, ankle characteristics such as ankle angle and torque were measured and compared to biological ankle characteristics. Results show that the proposed hybrid controller can maintain existing controller's biomimetic characteristics. In addition, it can also recognize to a qualitative extent the intended command torque for ankle push off and user's desire to switch between control modalities for different terrains. The study shows that it is possible and desirable to use neural signals as control signals for prosthetic leg controllers.

The causes of preterm birth are unknown, resulting in ineffective treatment, but it is correlated with ascension of vaginal bacteria through the cervix, which is normally protected by a dense mucus plug during pregnancy. This mucus plug, consisting of a tight meshwork of glycoproteins called mucins, should prevent pathogens from accessing the sterile uterine environment. Cervical mucus from women at high risk and low risk for preterm birth was collected and compared. The aim of this study was to discover differences that will lead to clues about why preterm birth occurs, and ultimately what can be done about it in terms of prevention and intervention. Using rheological techniques and a translocation assay, we found that cervical mucus from women at high risk is more translucent and more elastic under both elongational and shear stress, than cervical mucus in normal pregnancies. These properties more closely resemble mucus during ovulation, when spermatozoa can most easily penetrate the barrier, than mucus in normal pregnancy. Furthermore, high risk mucus is more permeable to beads of comparable size to viruses, suggesting the barrier is weakened and foreign particles may harmfully traverse it to cause intrauterine infection. The techniques in this paper have not been previously used to study cervical mucus in the context of preterm labor, but their results may have important implications. If these mucus properties in women indeed permit increased bacterial infection through the cervix, then they can be used to stratify patients, allowing for more personalized prenatal care to lower the rate of preterm birth.

An inherent goal in developing cartilage-replacement treatments is ensuring that tissue-engineered constructs possess the same properties as native cartilage tissue. Biochemical assays and imaging techniques can be used to study some of the main components of cartilage and assess the value of potential therapies. Agarose and self-assembling peptides have been used to make hydrogels for in vitro culture of bovine bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) which can differentiate into chondrocytes, undergo chondrogenesis, and produce cartilage tissue. So far, differences in cell morphology that characterize chondrogenesis had been observed in peptide hydrogels like KLD and RAD but not in the 2.0% agarose hydrogels typically used for culture. A tissue engineering study was conducted to determine if a suitable environment for cell proliferation and differentiation could be obtained using different agarose compositions. BMSCs were cultured in 0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.0% agarose hydrogels for 21 days following TGF-p1 supplementation. Results indicate that the 0.5% agarose hydrogels are clearly inferior scaffolds when compared to the 1.0% and 2.0% agarose hydrogels, which are generally comparable. Since agarose gels appear to be suboptimal in promoting chondrogenesis, self-assembling peptides should be used in future studies. In addition to the biochemical assays traditionally used in cartilage tissue engineering studies, atomic force microscopy (AFM) can be used to image aggrecan, one of the main components of cartilage. Imaging studies were carried out using fetal bovine epiphyseal aggrecan to optimize previous extraction and sample preparation procedures, as well as an AFM imaging protocol, for samples containing aggrecan. Experiments were conducted with 10, 25, and 50 ptg/mL aggrecan solutions to find the minimum concentration needed to create aggrecan monolayers on APTES-mica that would yield acceptable AFM images (25 [mu]g/mL). AFM instrument and software parameters were optimized to find the working range of the integral and proportional gains (0.2 - 0.4 and 0.6 - 0.8, respectively) and to increase the resolution, showing fields at the 800 nm level. Finally, an image processing protocol relevant to these molecules was established. ",

    "text": "Behavioral and genetic characteristics of intestinal cell lineages in health and disease The intestinal crypt is a highly dynamic system, as the entire epithelium is constantly turned over and renewed by the proliferative stem cells located at the bottom of the crypt. While this system is crucial for nutrient absorption, any derangements in the proliferative cells can quickly lead to cancer. In this thesis, we sought to better understand the behavioral and genetic characteristics of the different cell types along the intestinal crypt, in a mouse model. We first attempted to quantify the migration velocities and proliferative rates at a single-cell level using 5-ethynol-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) pulse-chase labeling. While we observed marked differences in the proliferation rates between the absorptive and secretory lineages (the former is faster), our experimental setup was unable to resolve any possible differences in migratory behaviors. We then turned our attention to quantifying the spatial expression patterns of selected transcripts in the intestinal crypt, both in wildtype and in an inducible APC-loss cancer model. We were able to show that the transcript expression profiles of key differentiation and proliferation markers (Creb313, Gob5, Ki-67, cMyc), as well as the ephrin signaling (EphB2 and EphrinBl) were significantly altered in the early stages (7 days) of adenoma formation. A more detailed analysis also separated this derangement in terms of extrinsic factors (e.g. altered cell composition along the crypt) and intrinsic factors (e.g. inherent change of cellular expression profile after APC loss). What is particularly interesting is that even differentiated cells in adenomas can exhibit such derangements. Our hypothesis to explain this observation is that these differentiated cells actually come from transformed stem cells. To test this hypothesis, we needed to verify that these cells indeed have excision at the Apc locus. After several approaches involving both single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the results were ultimately inconclusive. However, we propose several additional approaches that this hypothesis can be verified, and if verified, some biologically significant questions that can be addressed regarding the early dynamics of stem cells in intestinal cancer development.

Direct nerve Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) induces muscles to contract by electrically stimulating nerves, which shows promise for clinical applications in restoring muscle function in SC. However, Functional Electrical Stimulation is limited by the lack of graded response in muscle contraction and by high fatigability due to the reversal of recruitment order of motor units. Previous work showed that ion-selective membranes can be used to modulate Ca 2 ions in situ, decreasing the current threshold for nerve stimulation and eliciting a more graded muscle contraction response. This work developed polyimide-based cuff ion-selective electrodes to enable the future application of this technique in vivo. The developed electrodes were flexible, elastic and conductive. In vitro tests of the electrodes by stimulation of frog sciatic nerve reproduced the decrease in stimulation current threshold, which had been observed in planar glass-based electrodes, in the flexible polyimide-based electrodes. Additionally, cuffing the stimulated nerves with ion-selective electrodes was more effective at decreasing current threshold than planar stimulation. This work also analyzed data on twitch width, contraction time and relaxation time to infer effects of ion-selective electrodes on recruitment order. Stimulation with the ion-selective electrodes had higher twitch width, contraction time and relaxation time than traditional electrical stimulation at all force levels. The difference was particularly high at low force levels, indicating an effect of Calcium ion depletion on recruitment order. ",

Although cisplatin has proved efficacious in the treatment of various solid tumors, melanoma seems particularly resistant to this chemotherapeutic drug. Reports show that melanoma patients whose tumors express nitric oxide (NO) synthase and/or nitrotyrosine are often faced with poor prognosis. Moreover, it has been shown that NO produced by melanoma cells sustains lower sensitivity to cisplatin toxicity in vitro. Because inflammatory products such as NO and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are associated with the genesis and evolution of cancer, we hypothesized that these oxidative species may regulate key components of the response of melanoma to cisplatin. Using a system for controlled delivery of NO to simulate the NO levels believed to occur during inflammation, we showed that human melanoma (A375) cells pre-exposed to submicromolar NO concentrations were protected from a subsequent challenge with cisplatin. This protection was strongly associated with increased activity of the MAP-kinase cascade leading to activation of ERK1/2, as well as with downstream modulation of the apoptotic factors Bax and Bcl-2, and the transcription factors p53 and MiTF. Although NO favored increased expression and phosphorylation of p53, it also increased the expression of the p53 inhibitor MDM2, which may have counteracted p53-induced apoptosis upon cisplatin treatment. Also, likely via ERK1/2 activation, NO favored phosphorylation of MiTF, which is associated with survival signals. Furthermore, NO displayed the remarkable ability to overcome the effect of U0126, a MEK inhibitor, and promoted continuous phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (and hence cell survival), in contrast to cells not exposed to NO. Results also demonstrated that cisplatin-induced apoptosis was substantially decreased by the antioxidant precursor N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Unlike exogenous NO, cisplatin-induced ROS were linked to lower activation of ERK1/2, which was reversed by NAC. During the treatment with cisplatin, NAC led to lower levels of p53, which may have partially contributed to increased cell survival. However, in contrast to NO, NAC did not significantly alter the effects of cisplatin upon MiTF and apoptotic proteins studied. Altogether, our findings illustrate the complexity of the regulation of signaling components by oxidative species of distinct natures. ",

Insulin resistance is defined as the inability of cells and tissues to respond properly to ordinary amounts of insulin and is a precursor to many metabolic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Obesity, brought on in large part by caloric excess from high fat diet feeding, is a major contributor to insulin resistance. The recent drastic increase in the prevalence of obesity makes it imperative that steps are taken to more effectively treat and cure obesity-linked diseases such as diabetes. To identify optimal therapeutic targets, it is crucial to first gain a mechanistic understanding of obesity-induced insulin resistance, and understand how specific changes in the signaling network affect insulin sensitivity. Previous work has demonstrated that levels of SirT3, a mitochondrial protein deacetylase, are diet dependent. Additionally, SirT3 expression levels have been shown to mediate insulin and glucose tolerance in animals in a diet-dependent manner. Perturbations in SirT3 levels also alter the levels of phosphorylation on several canonical insulin signaling proteins. In my research, I further investigated the link between SirT3, diet and insulin resistance from a signaling network perspective. Using mouse liver as a model system, I analyzed liver tissue from mice fed a normal diet (insulin sensitive) or mice fed a high fat diet, thus inducing insulin resistance. Quantification of phenotypic and network events in response to insulin and utilization of computational techniques revealed activated pathways and nodes mediating insulin response, some of which had not been previously associated with the canonical insulin signaling network. I extended the study to analyze the role SirT3 plays in diet-mediated insulin sensitivity by perturbing the level of SirT3 in mice on both normal chow and high fat diets. The results of this research are useful for designing more efficacious therapies to treat insulin resistance-induced diseases. ",

Furthermore, sunlight is attributed both as a tumor initiator and a tumor promoter by favoring the clonal expansion of p53 mutated cells. By utilizing studies of the multiple genetic hit model of oncomutation and inference that preneoplasia appears to be a clonal continuation of juvenile growth in adult tissues from which one stem cell creates an embryonic organ with lethal consequences, this thesis is devoted to the analysis of the process of skin cancer development and distribution of mutant cells in human skin, as well as the calculation of and inferences based on Gostjeva and Thilly's hypothesis on mutational clone frequency is restricted to the fetal-juvenile period.

We performed a comparative global gene expression study using data from morphologically identical stage-matched sorted populations of human and mouse erythroid precursors from early to late erythroblasts. Induction and repression of major transcriptional regulators of erythropoiesis, as well as major erythroid-important proteins, are largely conserved between the species. In contrast, at a global level we identified a significant extent of divergence between the species, both at comparable stages and in the transitions between stages, especially for the 500 most highly expressed genes during development. This suggests that the response of multiple developmentally regulated genes to key erythroid transcriptional regulators represents an important modification that has occurred in the course of erythroid evolution. In developing a systematic framework to understand and study conservation and divergence between human and mouse erythropoiesis, we show how mouse models can fail to mimic specific human diseases and provide predictions for translating findings from mouse models to potential therapies for human disease.

There is no approved vaccine to prevent this disease, and resistance to available antimalarial drugs is becoming widespread. Identification of parasite genes essential to survival and virulence could facilitate the development of novel therapeutics and vaccines. However, these efforts have been impeded by difficulties in manipulating the parasite's genome and functionally perturbing gene expression in a controlled way. Our lab has developed inducible systems to control P. falciparum gene expression, and has achieved successful editing of the P. falciparum genome using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. We have integrated these capabilities into a modular and scalable framework that can be used to efficiently edit, regulate and delete any target parasite gene after a single genome editing operation. This approach will accelerate studies of parasite gene function, and help prioritize potential drug and vaccine targets. A key requirement in this framework is the efficient assembly of donor vectors for modifying target loci and installing the necessary regulatory parts. This necessitates cloning several large, [A+T]-rich P.falciparum genomic regions that can be quite tedious and rate limiting. In this document, we show a new cloning strategy using linear vectors that facilitates rapid and accurate assembly of vectors capable of transforming P. falciparum. We present evidence of successful chromosomal modification of several genes via spontaneous single crossover, as well as zinc finger nuclease- and Cas9- mediated genome editing strategies using our assembled donor vectors. We also show that these modifications enable controllable expression of several previously uncharacterized genes to elicit phenotypes that we are investigating in further mechanistic detail. Importantly, these transgenic parasites can now be rapidly generated to allow identification of novel essential parasite genes in as little as a month. ",

These metakaryotic stem cells, after acquiring necessary genetic, and possibly other events, are also the stem cells of precancerous, cancerous and metastatic lesions of carcinogenesis. Furthermore, our lab has discovered that metakaryotic stem cells, both in fetal development and tumor growth, use a peculiar mode of DNA synthesis and segregation that involves inter alia expression of large amounts of RNA polymerase beta during DNA synthesis. It was hypothesized that an inhibitor of DNA polymerase beta would be toxic to metakaryotic stem cells at concentrations lower than necessary to kill eukaryotic non stem cells. The polymerase beta small-molecule inhibitor chosen for this study was pamoic acid, a napthoic acid derivative. With it we determined the relative sensitivity of metakaryotes and eukaryotic cells in the human colorectal cancer cell culture, HT- 29mes, that expresses characteristics expected of colorectal cancer metastases. We conclude that, at 300 [mu]M and above pamoic acid does not selectively kill metakaryotes in cell culture below that concentration which kills eukaryotes. Rather, pamoic acid acts in a similar fashion as X-rays: eukaryotic non-stem cells are killed at lower doses than those that kill metakaryotic stem cells. Treatment of pamoic acid with these concentrations causes concomitant declines in colony-formation potential for both metakaryotes and eukaryotes alike. At lower overall survival levels, surviving colonies appear to have arisen from metakaryotic cells, not eukaryotic cells as evidenced by the presence of visible metakaryotic cells in most colonies and the ability of such colonies to support continuous growth upon passaging. We conclude with the possibility that this specific polymerase beta inhibitor is not an effective metakaryocide in culture, insofar as they are not selectively toxic for these stem cells in the HT-29mes colorectal cancer cell line.

This thesis describes a streamlined workflow for analyzing transcriptomic data. This streamlined workflow not only reduced the barrier to conducting the analysis but also reduced the analysis cycle time. With the use of this workflow, a number of historical Amgen microarray datasets were mined to identify gene expression signatures indicative of productivity. The result of this mining identified key biological pathways specific to a highly productive Amgen cell line. This work suggests that these pathways are critical to heightened levels of protein production. Using this information to engineer future cell lines could enable Amgen to improve cellular protein production by over 30%, impacting costs associated with drug substance manufacturing. More broadly, this example of streamlining and standardizing transcriptomic data provides a framework for how Amgen Process Development can leverage biological data to improve CHO systems understanding and achieve operational impacts.

    "text": "Use Of synthetic solid scaffolds to mechanically support a chondrocyte-seeded peptide hydrogel for articular cartilage repair Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) is a subtype of OA associated with cartilage defects caused by traumatic joint injury. Because articular cartilage has a limited innate healing response, due to its avascular, aneural, and alymphatic nature, these defects lead to chronic degenerative joint disease if left untreated. Current treatments to repair articular cartilage generally result in fibrocartilage that is mechanically and biochemically inferior to native hyaline tissue. This has motivated the development of tissue engineering strategies for cartilage defect repair. Hydrogel approaches have shown promising results in their ability to induce chondrogenesis, proliferation, and cartilage-like matrix production, but are often very soft at early time points and at risk of damage from joint articulation. Solid scaffolds solve this mechanical problem, but often sacrifice bioactivity and integration with native tissue. In order to avoid the drawbacks of each of these approaches, we proposed a composite scaffold approach using a synthetic solid scaffold, made of bioabsorbable polyglycolic acid:trimethylene carbonate (PGA:TMC) or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), loaded with a chondrocyte-seeded self-assembling peptide hydrogel, [KLDL]₃. We hypothesized that these composite scaffolds would benefit from the mechanical protection of the solid scaffolds as well as the pro-chondrogenic and proliferative effects of the KLD hydrogel, allowing chondrocytes to produce cartilage-like extracellular matrix in a protected mechanical environment. To test the potential of these composite scaffolds for use in cartilage repair, we measured cell distribution, viability, matrix production and accumulation, and static and dynamic mechanical properties. We found that cells could be evenly distributed through at least one of the solid scaffolds tested, with all showing proliferation and maintenance of viability over four-week culture. Per-cell matrix production was an order of magnitude higher than in KLD hydrogels alone. Mechanical properties of composite scaffolds appeared to be dominated by the solid scaffolds, showing that they offered mechanical protection to the soft hydrogel within. Use in a cartilage defect model showed potential for integration with native tissue given optimization of gel-casting methods. Overall, our results show that these composite scaffolds are a viable tissue engineering strategy for articular cartilage repair. ",

In order to improve these treatments and engineer novel therapies, it is crucial that we increase our understanding of how these antibiotics interact with cellular metabolism. Evidence is increasingly building that the efficacy of antibiotics relies critically on downstream metabolic effects, in addition to inhibition of primary targets. Here we present a novel computational pipeline to expedite investigation of these effects: we combine computational modelling of metabolic networks with data from experimental screens on antibiotic susceptibility to identify metabolic vulnerabilities that can enhance antibiotic efficacy. This approach utilizes genome-scale metabolic models of bacterial metabolism to simulate the reaction-level response of cellular metabolism to a metabolite counter screen. The simulated results are then integrated with experimentally determined antibiotic sensitivity measurements using machine learning. Following integration, a mechanistic understanding of the phenotype-level antibiotic sensitivity results can be extracted. These mechanisms further support the role of metabolism in the mechanism of action of antibiotic lethality. Consistent with current understanding, application of the pipeline to M. tuberculosis identified cysteine metabolism, ATP synthase, and the citric acid cycle as key pathways in determining antibiotic efficacy. Additionally, roles for metabolism of aromatic amino acids and biosynthesis of polyprenoids were identified as pathways meriting further investigation. ",

Detailed understanding of the mechanical processes at work could aid in the development and evaluation of protective strategies such as armor and helmets, and repair strategies including robotic surgery or needle-based drug delivery. However, due to the mechanical complexity of so-called \"soft tissues,\" including nonlinear viscoelastic behavior, surface adhesion, material failures and shock effects, the experimental characterization of various soft tissues is challenging and individual mechanical processes are often impossible to decouple without computational models and simulations. This thesis presents two finite element models designed to provide both replicate the results of indentation and impact experiments on synthetic polymers, aimed to decouple competing mechanical characteristics of contact based deformation. The first of these models describes the indentation on polydimethylsiloxane bilayer composites, with the aim of describing the relative effects of a adhesion and viscoelastic properties on the measured deformation response. That model expands on this objective via the analysis of the effects of surface adhesion commonly associated with highly compliant polymers and tissues. The second model attempts to replicate impact of a high velocity projectile on a relatively stiff material, polyurethane urea, and on a comparatively compliant polymer, gelatin hydrogel. These models provide means to simulate, predict and characterize material response, validated by comparison with available experiments. Such validated models can be used to simulate and design new materials as tissue simulants or as protective media that predictably dissipate concentrated mechanical impact. ",

As a first step in the development of tools to study HLGAG structure, biochemical studies were completed on the heparinases, a family of three HLGAG-degrading enzymes from Flavobacterium heparinum.

Current research has focused on developing such vehicles using end gene expression as the benchmark. While transgene protein production is the overall objective of successful gene delivery, such qualitative treatment of gene delivery, especially for non-viral vectors, may result in unoptimized vectors and potential rate limiting steps unidentified. Quantitative analysis of the gene delivery pathway is essential for the characterization, comparison, and design of vectors. The complex nature of the mechanisms for gene delivery, particularly at the cellular level, contains multiple potentially rate limiting steps to successful gene expression. Through quantitative methodologies, vector efficacy can be related to molecular characteristics and specific processes within the gene delivery pathway. These potentially rate limiting steps include, but are not limited to, cell surface association, subcellular trafficking, endosomal escape, nuclear translocation, vector unpackaging, and gene expression. Design of synthetic gene delivery vectors seeks to develop molecular systems mimicking virus-like infection behavior, including cell membrane attachment and rapid internalization followed by endosomal escape, nuclear localization, and finally gene expression. To explore such opportunities for vector optimization and design, a model human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line by sets of transfection agents complexed with a plasmid.

Current understanding of tissue differentiation mechanisms is based on studies of protein and RNAs that asymmetrically segregate between daughter cells during embryogenesis. Whether or not other types of biomolecules segregate asymmetrically has not been widely studied. In 1975, John Cairns proposed that ASCs preferentially segregate the oldest parental template DNA strands to themselves and pass on newly replicated DNA strands to their differentiating progeny in order to protect the stem cell from inheriting DNA replication mutations. This laboratory has shown non-random chromosome segregation in murine fetal fibroblasts that model asymmetric self-renewal like ASCs. In these cells, chromosomes that contain the oldest DNA strands co-segregate to the cycling daughter stem-like cells, while chromosomes with more recently replicated DNA segregate to the non-stem cell daughters. Previously, cytological methods were reported to elucidate non-random segregation in these cells. This dissertation research provides additional confirmation of the mechanism using physicochemical methods. Specifically, buoyant density-shift experiments in equilibrium CsCl density gradients were used to detect co-segregated \"immortal DNA strands\" based on incorporation of the thymidine base analogue bromodeoxyuridine. In addition, DNA from cells undergoing non-random mitotic chromosome segregation was analyzed for unique DNA base modifications and global structural modifications (by HPLC and melting temperature analyses).

Intracellular mechanosensors are thought to be activated by conformational changes induced by local cellular deformations. Since these mechanosensors have been speculated to be located in several cellular domains including the cell membrane, the cytoskeleton, and the nucleus, it is necessary to achieve a detailed understanding of subcellular mechanics. In this work, we present novel methods to independently quantify cytoskeletal displacements, mechanical coupling between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix, and nuclear mechanics based on high resolution tracking of cellular structures and receptor bound magnetic beads in response to applied strain or microscopic forces. These methods were applied to study the effects of several human disease associated mutations on subcellular mechanics and to examine the interaction between known protein function and specific changes in cellular mechanical properties and mechanotransduction pathways. Initial experiments were targeted to the role of membrane adhesion receptors. Experiments with cells expressing a mutant form of the integrin-associated molecule tetraspanin CD151 revealed that CD151 plays a key role in selectively strengthening α6βl integrin-mediated adhesion to laminin-1.

Studying hepatotoxicity in vitro is a challenging task because hepatocytes, the metabolically active cells of the liver, are very difficult to maintain in culture. After just 24 hours, the cells detach from the plate and die, and even if they survive they usually do not express the metabolic functions which they have in vivo. It has been observed by others that culturing hepatocytes between two layers of collagen type I maintains in vivo-like morphology and also many drug metabolizing enzymes for weeks. In spite of the research examining drug metabolism in collagen sandwiches, there are very few studies evaluating this system for investigating hepatotoxicity. We cultured primary rat hepatocytes in the collagen sandwich configuration and our goal was to optimize this system for long-term studies and to examine toxicity of a variety of hepatotoxins. By measuring secretions of urea and albumin, and P4501A activity, we determined the optimal cell density to be 50,000 cells/cm2. We also evaluated the need for epidermal growth factor (EGF) in our cultures, by comparing urea and albumin secretions in cultures grown with and without EGF. The cultures without EGF had significantly less secretion of both urea and albumin just two days after plating. Therefore, we decided to include EGF in the medium.

Epidemiological studies have shown a correlation between exposure to AFBI and incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Mutations in p53 are observed in over 50% of the HCC samples studied, and a unique mutational hotspot occurs at the third position of codon 249 in this gene, yielding almost exclusively GC to TA transversions. It is of interest to evaluate the mutagenic properties of specific chemical structures of AFBI adducts in order to determine which of these may be responsible for the mutations that may play a role in the formation of HCC.

Some of these observations are brought to the attention of public health officials in the hope that an environmental cause within these communities may be discovered and subsequently eliminated. However, what appears to be a cluster of cancer cases locally may be a chance occurrence when viewed from the perspective of the entire state or region. The primary aim of this work was to obtain and analyze a data set of sufficient magnitude to provide a means to discover if distributions of cancer mortality rates among communities within a particular state, for any of the most common forms of cancer, were compatible with chance. To this end cancer mortality data for six of the largest states in the United States (California, Florida, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas) were collected, converted into mortality rates and analyzed to discover if the variations among communities could be accounted for by chance alone. These data comprised one third of all recorded deaths in the period of approximately 1969 to 1998. The 21 most common forms of adult and 6 most common forms of pediatric cancers were organized to permit analyses within each of the 6 states with regard to age (0-19, 65-84 and >/= 85 years), gender and ethnicity (European American and Non-European American descent). Key to this work was the mode of statistical analysis. For each community an expected mortality rate and its expected distribution was defined by the average mortality rate for all communities within each state and the binomial distribution, respectively. These expected distributions were summed for all communities to define the expected chance distribution of community mortality rates for each state, cancer, gender, age cohort and ethnicity. This produced nearly 800 separate \"chance\" distributions. Each of these was compared to the corresponding observed distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smimov statistical test. This test was designed to discover statistically significant differences between any two distributions. Here it was used to determine which of the nearly 800 observed distributions could not be accounted for by chance alone. Of these comparisons, 16 were found to have observed distributions significantly different from the expected by chance distributions. All 16 had distributions that exhibited greater dispersion than expected by chance, and none had distributions with less dispersion than the chance expectation. ",

The specificity involved in the HSGAG-protein interactions stems from the structural heterogeneity of HSGAGs, which are highly acidic biopolymers associated on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix. It is believed that structural specificity in the HSGAG-protein interactions determines the biological functions mediated by HSGAG-binding proteins such as basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2). A number of models have been proposed to account for the mode of FGF-FGFR interactions and the role of HSGAGs in modulating FGF2 signaling. It was hypothesized that one role played by HSGAGs was to stabilize FGF2 oligomers in a \"side-by-side\" or cis fashion for presentation to fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR). In this thesis research, we systematically examined different proposed modes of FGF2 dimerization and showed that extensive oligomerization of a FGF2 mutant protein could be achieved by oxidatively crosslinking. Heparin, a highly sulfated form of HSGAGs, was demonstrated to increase the extent of oligomerization. Therefore, the results reported here were consistent with the hypothesis that HSGAGs promoted FGF2 oligomerization in a \"side-by-side\" mode.

Recent progress in coupling bacterial GAG-degrading enzymes with sensitive analytical techniques has led to a revolution in understanding the structure-function relationship for an important subset of GAGs, namely heparin/heparan sulfate-like glycosaminoglycans (HSGAGs). The study of chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate (CS/DS), an equally important subset of GAGs, has lagged behind partially due to a lack of enzymatic and analytical tools akin to those developed for HSGAGs.

Taking advantage of the ability of carbohydrates to affect biological outcomes, several companies have already begun developing sugar-based structures as therapeutics for malaria and breast cancer, among others. However, the structural complexity that allows HSGAGs and N-glycans to exhibit such a wide array of activities also makes them more difficult to study than their protein and nucleotide counterparts.

A stable isotopically-labeled [13C2]-PGA is synthesized and used as an internal standard. The method is linear in response over the range of 30 fmol to 300 pmol and precision is verified by analysis of a synthetic, PGA-containing oligodeoxynucleotide.

Only the carboxy-terminal domain of TIMP-2 (T2C) and not the MMP-inhibitory N-terminal domain (T2N), inhibited capillary EC proliferation.

These findings demonstrate that TIMP-2 possesses two distinct types of anti-angiogenic activities which can be uncoupled from each other. The anti-proliferative activity of T2C was further mapped to the 24-amino acid peptide, Loop 6, which proved to be a potent inhibitor of both embryonic and nitogen-stimulated angiogenesis in vivo. Initial studies into the mechanism(s) by which Loop 6 inhibits angiogenesis revealed that the anti-proliferative effects of Loop 6 are due, at least in part, to the inhibition of cell cycle progression and not to the induction of apoptosis. This inhibition was associated with increased levels of cell cycle inhibitor p27. Although Loop 6 did not compete with bFGF for binding to its receptor, ",

Biocompatible scaffolds assist in providing a template for cell distribution and extracellular matrix accumulation in a three-dimensional geometry. In these studies, a self-assembling peptide hydrogel is evaluated as a potential scaffold for cartilage repair using a model bovine cell source. A seeding technique is developed for 3-D encapsulation of chondrocytes in a peptide hydrogel. The chondrocyte-seeded peptide hydrogel was then evaluated cellular activities in vitro under standard culture conditions and also when subjected to dynamic compression. During 4 weeks of culture in vitro, chondrocytes seeded within the peptide hydrogel retained their morphology and developed a cartilage-like ECM rich in proteoglycans and type II collagen, indicative of a stable chondrocyte phenotype. Time dependent accumulation of this ECM was paralleled by increases in material stiffness, indicative of deposition of mechanically-functional neo-tissue. Culture of chondrocyte-seeded peptide hydrogels in ITS-supplemented medium was investigated as an alternative to high serum culture. Low serum (0.2%), ITS-supplemented medium was found to maintain high levels of cell division and extracellular matrix synthesis and accumulation, as seen in high serum culture. Furthermore, low serum, ITS medium induced minimal chondrocyte de-differentiation on the surface of the hydrogel. This is in contrast to high serum culture, where surface de-differentiation and subsequent proliferation led to a 5-10 cell thick layer that stained positive for type I collagen. ",

Given that such genetic changes may promote tumorigenesis, it is critical to identify those genetic and environmental factors that render cells susceptible to homologous recombination. Our goal is to elucidate the mechanisms of DNA damage-induced recombination and to determine the role of DNA repair enzymes in modulating homologous recombination in eukaryotic cells. Alkylating agents are abundant in our environment and are generated endogenously as normal metabolites. In addition to their mutagenic and cytotoxic effects, alkylating agents stimulate homologous recombination in eukaryotic cells. Removal of alkylated bases by DNA glycosylases, such as the Magl 3-methyladenine (3MeA) DNA glycosylase, initiates the base excision repair (BER) pathway. To investigate the molecular basis for methylation-induced homologous recombination in S. cerevisiae, intrachromosomal recombination was measured under conditions where MAGI expression levels were varied. Cells lacking Magl show increased susceptibility to methylation-induced recombination, suggesting that unrepaired 3MeA lesions induce recombination. Overexpression of M4GI also elevates recombination levels, presumably due to the accumulation of recombinogenic BER intermediates. ",

It is now becoming increasingly evident that sequence specific GAG-protein interactions play critical roles in cell growth, development, angiogenesis, cancer, anticoagulation and microbial pathogenesis. Therefore it is important to understand the specificity of glycan-protein interactions and how these specific interactions influence their structure-function relationships. This thesis addresses many challenges in this emerging area of glycomics, by taking an integrated approach that couples biophysical and biochemical methods with a bioinformatics framework to represent and process sequence information content in GAGs. With this motivation the thesis is divided into 4 components 1. Using heparin/heparan sulfate GAGs (HSGAGs) - fibroblast growth factor (FGF) as a model GAG-protein system, the first part focuses on determining the structural basis of FGF oligomerization, sequence specific FGF-HSGAG interactions and FGF-receptor (FGFR) interactions which collectively influence the specificity of HSGAG mediated FGF signaling. 2. The second part focuses on developing enzymatic tools for analysis of GAGs using chondroitinase B, HSGAG 2-0 sulfatase and 3-0 sulfotransferase as model enzymes. For each of these enzymes a theoretical model for the enzyme-substrate structural complex is developed and it is coupled with the site directed mutagenesis and biochemical studies to determine its catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity. 3. To deal with the heterogeneity and high information density of GAG sequences, an informatics based approach to decode GAG sequence information has been developed. ",

Due to a lack of effective tools to study structure-function relationship of these complex molecules, the role(s) of HLGAGs in cancer remains largely indirect and poorly understood. To study the role(s) of HLGAGs in cancer growth, metastasis and angiogenesis, tumor systems were studied using heparinases I and III which have distinct substrate specificities. Studies, focusing on the biochemistry of the heparinase active site, elucidated key interactions important for enzymatic activities, thus enabling the biological studies presented here. In vitro cell culture study with heparinases as tools clearly showed that cell surface HLGAGs are involved in regulating fundamental cellular activities including cell proliferation, invasion and adhesion. Significantly, heparinase I and III demonstrated distinct effect on these cellular activities with heparinase III inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, invasion and adhesion in selected model systems and heparinase I inhibiting these processes. Further in vivo studies in animal tumor models confirmed and expanded the distinct responses to heparinase I and III treatment. HLGAG fragments generated from heparinase treatment were found to be responsible for the effect of heparinase treatment in tumor models. Moreover, cell surface HLGAGs containing cryptic activatory and inhibitory sequence information were identified and characterized. In contrast to heparinase I- generated HLGAG fragments, heparinase III- generated HLGAG fragments were shown here to inhibit both primary tumor growth and secondary lung metastasis. ",

However, designing higher affinity interactions has remained difficult. Both high affinity interactions from nature and the results from directed evolution affinity maturation processes may yield clues about the important structural and energetic contributions to attain these tight associations. In this Thesis, we investigate affinity maturation of antibodies for very high affinity binding. Two single chain antigen-binding fragment (scFv) antibody systems that were engineered to obtain higher affinity interactions through directed evolution were probed using biophysical techniques to illuminate affinity modulation in proteins. First, anti-c-erbB-2 antibodies and their binding partner, the extracellular domain of the glycoprotein tumor antigen c-erbB-2, were examined. Thermodynamic studies were carried out on the originally identified human scFv and three higher affinity mutants. Although the first two steps included either entropic or enthalpic gains to affinity, the third improvement came from both types. This study demonstrates that a single energetic component is not generally responsible for the increased affinity within a given protein-protein affinity maturation pathway. Second, a family of anti-fluorescein antibodies and their binding to the small molecule fluorescein-biotin were explored. The femtomolar affinity matured anti-fluorescein antibody, 4M5.3, was compared to its wildtype high affinity precursor, 4-4-20.

Much work has been done to study the role of inflammation in carcinogenesis. One hypothesis suggests that inflammation causes oxidative stress that induces damage to cellular targets, including DNA. The multistep model of cancer proposes that cancer is a genetic disease in which mutations are required in carcinogenesis. When this theory was championed, research focused on somatic mutations. The focus has broadened to include epigenetic mechanisms in changing gene expression. The association between chronic infection, chronic inflammation and increased cancer risk has been supported by epidemiologic studies. Data link chronic inflammation associated with infectious disease to increased cancer risk. Some examples of such infectious agents include hepatitis B virus, Schistosoma haemotobium, and Helicobacter pylori. One objective of this thesis was to investigate the role of inflammation in self-limiting infection. Additional objectives focus on evaluating a novel model of intestinal and extraintestinal cancer, and using immune regulating cells as treatment for intestinal cancer. For the first objective, a murine mutational analysis model was used to study infection with Citrobacter rodentium, an enteric bacterium that causes self-limiting hyperplasia and inflammation. Increased mutant frequency was observed in association with elevated levels of iNOS 13 days post infection. The second aim, to characterize a novel model of neoplasia, led to the discovery of basosquamous cancer in mice with intestinal tumors.

Using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we directly visualized the nanometer scale structure of aggrecan deposited on a 2-D substrate, including the first high resolution imaging of individual GAG chains along the core protein.

The focus of this work is to modify the polymer's binding capability to cells while not altering the bulk properties. Through the use of both phage display of peptide libraries and yeast surface display of scFv libraries the surface of chlorine-doped polypyrrole (PPyCl) has been modified to facilitate binding of neuronal phenotype cells. The selection of peptides using phage display found a surface specific recognition peptide (T59) that was made bivalent by altering the C-terminus with an integrin binding epitope. The bivalency of the modified T59 peptide was exploited to tether phenochromocytoma (PC12) cells to the surface of PPyCl. Furthermore the tethering of the cells to PPyCl through the peptide does not decrease the cells neuronal function and maintains the bulk conductive polymers characteristics. Using the peptide as a bivalent linker, the addition of other types of cells, drugs, growth factors, and enzymes could be incorporated for various biomedical applications. ",

We found that the presence of fibrillar collagen correlated with hindered diffusion in vivo, and also in vitro, in collagen gels prepared to mimic tumor extracellular matrix. Modification of the tumor collagen matrix directly with purified bacterial collagenase, or indirectly with relaxin treatment, resulted in increased diffusion coefficients of macromolecules within tumors in vivo. In order to quantitate the changes in collagen content and structure induced by relaxin treatment, we adapted and further developed the imaging technique of intravital second harmonic generation microscopy. Using second harmonic generation imaging in combination with a fluorescently labeled gene therapeutic vector, we demonstrated that the spread of these viral vectors within tumors is limited by the fibrillar collagen in the extracellular matrix.

This question has drawn considerable interest since 1972, when it was first discovered that cells have an intrinsic ability to self-destruct through a process called apoptosis. Since then, apoptosis has been shown to play a critical role in both normal physiology and disease. In addition, many of the basic molecular mechanisms that control apoptosis have been revealed. Yet despite the known list of interactions and regulators, it remains difficult to inspect the network of apoptosis-related proteins and predict how cells will behave. The challenge is even greater when one considers interactions with other networks that are anti-apoptotic, such as growth-factor networks. In this thesis, we develop an approach to measure, analyze, and predict how complex intracellular signaling networks transduce extracellular stimuli into cellular fates. This approach entails three interrelated aims: 1) to develop high-throughput, quantitative techniques that measure key nodes in the intracellular network; 2) to characterize the quantitative changes in network state and cell behavior by exposing cells to diverse fate-changing stimuli; and 3) to use data-driven modeling approaches that analyze large signaling-response datasets to suggest new biological hypotheses.

Alterations in the biosynthesis of this molecule over time could impact the ability of the tissue to perform its necessary functions. Several factors have been shown to alter the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate in cartilage; among them are age, disease, depth of tissue, and mechanical compression. Specifically, mechanical compression has been shown to have a significant effect on the sulfation pattern and chain length and number in cartilage explant studies. The mechanisms that govern these alterations, however, have not been determined.

The effects of mechanical compression on the transcription rates of enzymes associated with the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate have not been previously studied. To perform this study in a bovine model, portions of the bovine genome had to be sequenced, PCR primers designed, and bulk expression levels determined.

Subsequently, methods to isolate HSGAGs from the cell surface were optimized and the ability of HSGAGs to support FGF signaling was investigated. Cell surface HSGAGs can define the responsiveness of a given cell to FGF1 and FGF2 through multiple receptor isoforms.

However, this hypothesis has not been tested by an assay of nuclear point mutations in lungs of smokers and nonsmokers. Mismatch amplification mutation assay (MAMA), an effective form of allele-specific PCR, was applied for detection of point mutations in TP53 bp742, bp746 and bp747, K-ras bp35 and HPRT bp508 from a total of 291 tracheal-bronchial epithelial sectors from six smokers and nine non-smokers, yielding 949 individual mutational assays. The conditions of MAMA for each target point mutations were optimized such that the sensitivity of each was equal to or below 10⁻⁵.

Noticeably, the distributions of the MFs among sectors did not vary appreciably with the donor's smoking status. The mean MFs per lung were very similar between smokers and non-smokers for all five target mutations assayed (p >> 0.05). The mean MFs were slightly higher in females than males (p = 0.015).

From evaluation of whole genome transcript levels to expand the SRPA gene pool, 543 SRPA genes were discovered.

Joint injuries, including tears of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and meniscus, increase the risk for the development of OA and involve both mechanical damage to cartilage, meniscus and synovial tissues, and tissue degradation associated with cytokine-induced inflammation. While the role of inflammatory cytokines in OA is still controversial, their role in rheumatoid arthritis is evidenced by the successful use of anti-TNF-ca and anti-IL-1 therapies to abrogate disease symptoms and progression. In vitro, both IL-13 and TNF-ca promote chondrocyte-mediated matrix degradation and inhibit cartilage matrix synthesis, while mechanical damage causes cell death, matrix damage, and decreased cell biosynthesis. Understanding the similarities and differences in cartilage responses to inflammatory cytokines and mechanical injury is important in understanding the catabolic-anabolic shifts that typify OA progression. Therefore, the objectives of this thesis were (1) to identify the role of TNF-a and IL-1 induced nitric oxide (NO) as a mediator of cartilage tissue damage; ",

We have developed a model immunization system designed to allow these steps in the DC life cycle to be controlled in the context of a subunit vaccine. The system is comprised of microspheres encapsulating chemokines and hydrogel nanoparticles; each nanoparticle contains antigen and DC maturation signals (e.g., TLR ligands). The nanoparticles remain sequestered within the carrier microspheres but the chemokine is released at a controllable rate, creating a local chemoattractant gradient centered on each microsphere. DCs are attracted to individual microspheres where nanoparticles are concentrated; attracted DCs extract nanoparticles from the carrier microspheres, and receive maturation signals coincident with the delivery of antigen into both class I and class II MHC processing pathways.

Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism was profiled based on the hypothesis that N-hydroxylated metabolites are critical intermediates in the formation of DNA adducts. This work was extended to assess in vitro DNA adduct formation with the cell-free and cell-based assays. Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) was used for detection and semi-quantification of DNA adducts formed by 14C-labeled alkylanilines.

However, the response of CTP to most growth factors and cytokines is unknown. Many envisioned applications of CTP, such as treating large defects in bone, involve in vivo implantation of CTP attached to a scaffold, a process that creates an acute inflammatory environment that may be hostile to CTP survival. This project entails the design of a two-component polymeric implant system to aid in the healing process of bony defects by influencing cell behaviors at the implant site through the covalent modification of the implant surface with selected ligands. We investigate cellular responses of CTP on a biomaterial surface covalently modified with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and find that surface-tethered EGF (tEGF) promotes both cell spreading and survival more strongly than saturating concentrations of soluble EGF. By sustaining MEK-ERK signaling, tEGF increases the contact of CTP with an otherwise moderately adhesive synthetic polymer and confers resistance to apoptosis induced by the proinflammatory cytokine, FasL.

However, the design principles governing the construction and operation of these networks remain mostly unknown. To discover design principles in these networks, we investigated and developed a set of computational tools described below. First, we looked into the application of optimization techniques to explore network topology, parameterization, or both, and to evaluate relative fitness of networks operational strategies. In particular, we studied the ability of an enzymatic cycle to produce dynamic properties such as responsiveness and transient noise filtering. We discovered that non-linearity of the enzymatic cycle allows more effective filtering of transient noise. Furthermore, we found that networks with multiple activation steps, despite being less responsive, are better in filtering transient noise. Second, we explored a method to construct compact models of signal transduction networks based on a protein-domain network representation. This method generates models whose number of species, in the worst case, scales quadratically to the number of protein-domain sites and modification states, a tremendous saving over the combinatorial scaling in the more standard mass-action model was estimated to consist of more that 10⁷ species and was too large to simulate; however, a simplified model consists of only 132 state variables and produced intuitive behavior. The resulting models were utilized to study the roles of a scaffold protein and of a shared binding domain to pathway functions. ",

An phage library with an octapeptide library on the major coat protein (pVIII) was used for selection of binders to cobalt ions. Fibrous structures with directionally ordered phage were obtained by interaction with cobalt ions.

Because S. cerevisiae screens for enhanced protein secretion have traditionally utilized low-throughput and often plate-based methods, a high-throughput, liquid phase assay could offer a real advantage in secretory selection. In this thesis, yeast surface display is investigated as a potential proxy for heterologous protein secretion. Although ultimately unsuitable as a screening proxy, the surface display experiments did show a novel method of improving protein secretion by co-expressing a more stably folded protein with the protein of interest.

To date, no robust, efficient method for the pure, ex vivo expansion of human HSCs has been demonstrated. Previous methods primarily induced the expansion of committed hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), yielding even less pure populations of HSCs. This research was based on the hypothesis that, like for other adult stem cells (ASCs), the major barrier to expanding HSCs ex vivo is in preferentially regulating the asymmetric self-renewal of HSCs without loss in their ability to produce differentiated committed HPCs. This laboratory has shown that a p53-dependent pathway specifically controls the self-renewal pattern of several types of ASCs and thereby provides an effective means for expansion of ASCs in culture. The method, which involves the use of purine metabolites to achieve suppression of asymmetric cell kinetics, is referred to as SACK. The utility of the p53-dependent pathway was investigated for directing expansion of human HSCs. In order to support this investigation, the proliferation of HPCs in in vitro cultures was repressed by culturing cells without hematopoietic growth factors and cytokines. ",

Deep ultraviolet microscopy received attention in the 1950s as a way to generate image contrast from the strong absorbance of proteins and nucleic acids at wavelengths shorter than 300 nm. However, the lethal effects of these wavelengths limited their usefulness in studies of cell function, separating the contributions of protein and nucleic acid proved difficult, and scattering artifacts were a significant concern. We have used short exposures of deep-ultraviolet light synchronized with an ultraviolet-sensitive camera to observe mitosis and motility in living cells without causing necrosis, and quantified absorbance at 280 nm and 260 nm together with tryptophan native fluorescence in order to calculate maps of nucleic acid mass, protein mass, and quantum yield in unlabeled cells. We have also developed a method using images acquired at 320nm and 340nm, and an equation for Mie scattering, to determine a scattering correction factor for each pixel at 260nm and 280nm. These developments overcome the three main obstacles to previous deep UV microscopy efforts, creating a new approach to imaging unlabeled living cells that acquires quantitative information about protein and nucleic acid as a function of position and time.

Mapping the influence connections among biomolecules in a signaling cascade aids in understanding of the underlying biological process and in development of therapeutics for diseases involving aberrant pathways, such as cancer and autoimmune disease. In this thesis, we present an approach for automatically reverse-engineering the structure of a signaling pathway, from high-throughput data.

Our de novo reconstruction of a T-cell signaling map was highly accurate, closely reproducing the known pathway structure, and accurately predicted novel pathway connections.

More specifically, it focuses on detection methods involving surface interaction in channels with thicknesses on the order of a few microns or less. Through mass transfer analysis, we demonstrate that, for thin enough channels, sample detection is limited by the convective transport of analytes, and neither by diffusion nor reaction. The results provided extend the validity of transport models to include transport in the absence of mass transfer boundary layer. All existing analytic solutions to the Graetz problem are described and compiled. The analysis, complemented by finite element simulations, successfully predicts experimental observations made for on-chip immunoassays in micron-thick fluidic channels.

Frequently, progress in this area is made by altering an existing small molecule or protein for new function. This thesis presents methods for the analysis and design of rationally and evolutionarily designed molecules and focuses on applying these methods to make protein and small molecule changes more strategically. First, electrostatic analysis of a series of small molecule neuraminidase inhibitors was used to demonstrate that charge optimization improves the electrostatic component of the binding free energy, despite changes in binding mode and discrete chemical constraints. Additionally, chemical changes suggested by charge optimization frequently corresponded to tighter-binding inhibitors, indicating that this technique would be useful for the design of future inhibitors. Second, computational sequence and structure analysis were used to study the PDZ3-CRIPT binding interaction and a method for sequence analysis was developed to locate residues important for binding specificity. Third, computational analysis of the horseradish peroxidase active site suggested five positions as candidates for mutation, and further studies of new mutant enzymes let to ideas for the improvement of computational enzyme design procedures. Finally, both computational protein design techniques and a model of the evolutionary process were used to study the efficiency of evolution as a tool for creating new proteins in the laboratory. We identified sequences that serve as better evolutionary starting points that others and provide a general framework for considering the impact of protein structure on the allowed sequence space and therefore on the challenges that each protein presents to evolutionary protein engineering procedures.

While the structural and physiological consequences of negative supercoiling have been well studied, technical challenges have prevented extensive examination of positively supercoiled DNA. Studies suggest that at sufficiently high levels of overwinding, DNA relieves strain by adopting an elongated structure, where the bases are positioned extrahelically and the backbones occupy the center of the helix.

The use of primary human and primate hepatocytes is restricted by multiple experimental limitations including a rapid loss of susceptibility to infection in culture, lot-to-lot variability inherent in primary cell culture, and the necessity of treatment with chemical agents such as DMSO for reproducible infection.

Despite a half-century of basic and clinical research questions still remain about cholesterol gallstone pathogenesis. The purpose of the study presented herein is to analyze the roles of infection, and immunity in cholelithogenesis. The first two aims of this work were to analyze the role of enterohepatic Helicobacter spp. and the human gastric pathogen H. pylori in cholesterol gallstone formation. To test this, we prospectively infected C57UJ mice with a variety of Helicobacter spp. and fed infected and uninfected mice a lithogenic diet for eight weeks and analyzed biliary phenotype. Mice infected with H. bilis or coinfected with H. hepaticus and H. rodentium and fed a lithogenic diet developed cholesterol gallstones at 80% prevalence compared with approximately 10% in uninfected controls (P<0.05). Monoinfections with H. hepaticus, H. cinaedi, H. rodentium, and H. pylori gave a cholesterol gallstone prevalence of 40% (P<0.05), 30%, 20% and 20%, respectively; with the exception of H. hepaticus, cholesterol gallstone formation in these groups did not differ significantly from uninfected animals.

    "text": "Cisplatin cytotoxicity associated with tetracycline resistance determinants in Escherichia coli Tetracyclines, a broad-spectrum class of antibiotics, were discovered in the late 1940s, and became widely used because of their important advantages: they are inexpensive, safe, demonstrate good oral absorption, and are active against a broad range of bacterial pathogens. Unfortunately, as with most antibiotics, the emergence of microbial resistance to tetracyclines has become a serious problem. Today, most genera examined have tetracycline-resistant isolates, although the percentage varies according to species and geographic location. Due to the emergence of resistance, tetracyclines are no longer the antibiotics of choice in treatment of many conditions, although they are still extensively used to treat a variety of bacterial infections. Substantial research efforts have been directed towards reversing tetracycline resistance in bacteria. This work describes the development of a novel anti-bacterial treatment for diseases caused by bacteria resistant to tetracycline. It was found that tetracycline-resistant bacteria expressing the TnlO gene of tetracycline resistance, upon induction with tetracycline, became extremely susceptible to destruction by the DNA-damaging anti-cancer drug cisplatin. Tetracycline-resistant bacteria grown in tetracycline and subsequently treated with cisplatin in the presence of tetracycline were killed about 10⁵-fold more effectively than wild-type bacteria and tetracycline-resistant bacteria not exposed to tetracycline. This phenomenon was observed in different strains of tetracycline-resistant E. coli. Other antibiotics tested with respective antibiotic-resistant bacteria did not produce the same effect of sensitization to cisplatin, suggesting a unique relationship among cisplatin, tetracycline and the tetracycline resistance ",

    "text": "The role of mismatch repair in mediating cellular sensitivity to cisplatin : the Escherichia coli methyl-directed repair paradigm The anticancer drug cisplatin is in widespread use but its mechanism of action is only poorly understood. Moreover, human cancers acquire resistance to the drug, which limits its clinical utility. A paradox in the field is how loss of mismatch DNA repair leads to clinical resistance to this widely used drug. The phenomenon of cisplatin tolerance in mismatch repair deficient cells was initially discovered in E. coli, where methylation deficient dam mutants show high sensitivity to cisplatin and dam mutants with an additional mutation in either of the mismatch repair genes mutS or mutL show near wildtype levels of resistance. A prevalent explanation for this observation is the abortive repair model, which proposes that in dam mutants, where the strand discrimination signal is lost, mismatch repair attempts futile cycles of repair opposite cisplatin-DNA adducts. Previous findings have supported this model to the extent that MutS, the E. coli mismatch recognition protein, specifically recognizes DNA modified with cisplatin. However it has recently been shown that MutS binding to cisplatin adducts may contribute to toxicity by instead preventing the recombinational repair of a cisplatin-modified substrate, and we have previously shown that recombination is an essential mechanism for tolerating cisplatin damage.

The model provided a robust tool for analysis of detailed strain/stress fields induced within a single cell or cell monolayer produced by forcing one tethered microbead. On the assumption of structural homogeneity, stress and strain patterns were highly localized, suggesting that the effects of magnetocytometry are confined to a region extending less than 10tm from the bead. Modification of the model to represent experimental focal adhesion attachments supported a non-uniform force transmission to basal surface focal adhesion sites. Proteins in identified zones of high stresses in the cell are candidate mechanosensors and their molecular response to force was hence investigated, A generic model of protein extension under external forcing was created inspired by Kramers theory for reaction rate kinetics in liquids.

The eukaryotic cell is equipped with a dynamic frame, known as the cytoskeleton, that provides the cell's structural integrity in order to sustain and react to such forces. Therefore, understanding the mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton is an important step towards building models describing cell behavior. Filamentous actin (F-actin), as one of the major constituents of the cytoskeleton, has been the target of extensive in vitro studies to determine its mechanical properties in bulk. However, there is still a lack in the understanding of how the molecular interactions between F-actin and the proteins that arrange these filaments into networks regulate the dynamic properties of the cytoskeleton Here we present a novel, single molecule assay to test the rupture force of a complex formed by an actin binding protein (ABP) linking two actin filaments. We readily demonstrate the adaptability of this assay by testing it with two different ABPs: filamin, a crosslinker, and a-actinin, a bundler. We measured rupture forces of 28-73 pN and 30-56 pN for filamin/actin and a-actinin/actin respectively, suggesting that the former is a slightly stronger interaction. Moreover, since no ABP unfolding events were observed at our force levels, our results suggest that ABP unbinding is a more relevant mechanism than unfolding for the temporal regulation of the mechanical properties of the actin cytoskeleton. In addition, we explore the micro-scale properties of F-actin networks reconstituted in vitro. ",

This study utilized three loading protocols that span the range of forces and flows induced by in vivo loading. Constant (static) compression of cartilage explants induces a transient hydrostatic pressure buildup and fluid exudation from the compacted matrix until relaxation leads to a new equilibrium compressed state. Dynamic compression induces cyclic matrix deformation, hydrostatic pressures, fluid flows, and streaming currents. Dynamic tissue shear causes cyclic matrix deformation only. After applying these loading protocols to intact cartilage explants for 1 to 24 hours, we used real-time PCR to measure the temporal expression profiles of selected genes associated with cartilage homeostasis. In concurrent experiments, we assessed the involvement of intracellular signaling pathways using molecular inhibitors. In order to interpret the results we developed two techniques that reliably clustered intermediate-sized datasets using principal component analysis and k-means clustering. Mechanical loading regulated a variety of genes including matrix proteins, proteases, protease inhibitors, transcription factors, cytokines, and growth factors.

This led us to study early shear effects on cell-cell adherens junctions. We found a 30±6% increase in the number of VE-cadherin molecules in the junctions. The strength of interactions of endothelial cells with surfaces coated with recombinant VE-cadherin protein also increased after laminar flow. These observations suggest that endothelial cell junction proteins respond to flow onset. The process of clustering may induce diffusion of monomers to the junction area, resulting in an overall increase in VE-cadherins in the junctions. To directly confirm the role of adherens junctions in the decrease in cell crawling speed, we used siRNA-knockdown technique to produce cells lacking VE-cadherin. These cells showed no decline in crawling speed under flow. Our interpretation is consistent with previous data on junction disassembly 8 hr after flow onset. The speed of endothelial cell crawling returns to the original level by that time, and junctional disassembly may explain that phenomenon. In order to understand better the change in VE-cadherin distribution under flow and during junction formation and remodelling, we developed a mathematical model of VE-cadherin redistribution in endothelial cells. This model allowed us to develop a quantitative framework for analysis of VE-cadherin redistribution and estimate the amount of protein in the junctions and on the apical surface. In addition to that, the model explains rapid junction disassembly in the leukocyte transmigration and junction formation in subconfluent cells. ",

To assess any potential hypotheses for this increase required knowledge of the mortality rate changes specific to each form of cancer, and the time points when these rates had changed. For this purpose, population and cancer mortality data of the U.S. were collected and organized to create age-specific mortality rates for each birth decade from the 1800s forward, delineated by the organ of incidence. Concurrently, cancer survival data were collected so as to correct for any effect of improved treatment on historical changes in cancer mortality rates. To analyze these data, a mathematical model for the three-stage process of carcinogenesis (initiation, promotion, and progression) was developed to estimate for each birth decade cohort the value of the fraction of the cohort at lifetime risk for that cancer, the value of the growth rate of the respective precancerous lesion, and the values for the mutation rates of normal and precancerous cells in the organ of incidence. This methodology permits the analysis of the potential historical effect of new chemical exposures during the last century on cancer mortality rates. These chemical exposures represent potential risk factors that determine the fraction of the population at risk of developing cancer (lifetime, primary risk factor), or that hasten death by cancer by altering either mutation or cell kinetic rates (accelerating, secondary risk factor.)

The goal of this study was to examine the progression of chondrocyte signaling responses to mechanical stimulation in 3-D culture during tissue regeneration. To investigate the role of integrins in chondrocyte mechanotransduction, function-blocking antibodies and small-molecule antagonists were used to disrupt integrin-matrix interactions during dynamic compression of chondrocytes in 3-D agarose culture. At early days in culture, blocking [alpha]v[beta]3 integrin abolished dynamic compression stimulation of proteoglycan synthesis, independent of effects in free-swell culture, while blocking [alpha]5[beta]1 integrins abolished the effect of compression only when blocking in free-swell increased proteoglycan synthesis. This suggests that disrupting [alpha]v[beta]3 and [alpha]5[beta]1 interactions with the ECM influences proteoglycan synthesis in distinct pathways and that [alpha]v[beta]3 more directly influences the mechanical response. To further distinguish individual mechanotransduction pathways, we investigated the temporal gene transcription response of chondrocytes to ramp-and-hold compression on Days 1, 10, and 28 in 3-D agarose culture. Clustered and individual gene expression profiles changed temporally and in magnitude over time in culture. Day 1 cultures differed from Days 10 and 28, reflecting changes in cell microenvironment with development of pericellular and extracellular matrices. Comparisons with the response of intact tissue to compression suggested similar regulatory mechanisms.

Guanine is the most frequently oxidized base in the DNA, and generation of a guanine radical cation (G'\") as an intermediate in the oxidation reaction leads to migration of a resulting cationic hole through the DNA n-stack until it is trapped at the lowest-energy sites. These sites reside at runs of guanines, such as 5'-GG-3' sequences, and are characterized by the lowest sequence-specific ionization potentials (IPs). The charge transfer mechanism suggests that hotspots of oxidative DNA damage induced by electron transfer reagents can be predicted based on the primary DNA sequence. However, preliminary data indicated that nitrosoperoxycarbonate (ONOOCO2\"), a mediator of chronic inflammation and a one-electron oxidant, displayed unusual guanine oxidation properties that were the focus of present work. As a first step in our study, we determined relative levels of guanine oxidation, induced by ONOOCO2 in all possible three-base sequence contexts (XGY) within double-stranded oligonucleotides. These levels were compared to the relative oxidation induced within the same guanines by photoactivated riboflavin, a one-electron reagent. We found that, in agreement with previous studies, photoactivated riboflavin was selective for guanines of lowest IPs located within 5'-GG-3' sequences. In contrast, ONOOCO2\" preferentially reacted with guanines located within 5'-GC-3' sequences characterized by the highest IPs. This demonstrated that that sequence-specific IP was not a determinant of guanine reactivity with ONOOCO2\". Sequence selectivities for both reagents were double-strand specific. Selectivity of ONOOCO2 for 5'-GC-3' sites was also observed in human genomic DNA after ligation-mediated PCR analysis. ",

GAGs are heterogeneous and often sulfated linear polys accharides found throughout the extracellular environment, and available to researchers only in limited mixtures. A series of sensitive label-free analytical tools were developed to provide sequence information and to quantify whole epitopes from GAG mixtures. Three complementary sets of tools were developed to provide GAG sequence information. Two novel exolytic sulfatases from Flavobacterium heparinum that degrade heparan/heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (HSGAGs) were cloned and characterized. These exolytic enzymes enabled the exo-sequencing of a HSGAG oligosaccharide. Phenylboronic acids (PBAs) were specifically reacted with unsulfated chondroitin sulfate (CS) disaccharides from within a larger mixture. The resulting cyclic esters were easily detected in mass spectrometry (MS) using the distinct isotopic abundance of boron. Electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MSn) was employed to determine the fragmentation patterns of HSGAG disaccharides. These patterns were used to quantify relative amounts of isomeric disaccharides in a mixture. Fragmentation information is valuable for building methods for oligosaccharide sequencing, and the general method can be applied to quantify any isomers using MSn. Three other tools were developed to quantify GAG epitopes. Two microfluidic devices were characterized as HSGAG sensors. Sensors were functionalized either with protamine to quantify total HSGAGs or with antithrombin-III (AT-III) to quantify a specific anticoagulant epitope. ",

Modeling the cell or even one cellular function requires a computational architecture that integrates multiple biological pathway models in a scalable manner while ensuring minimal effort to maintain the resulting integrated model. Scalable is defined as the ease in which more and more biological pathway models can be integrated. Current architectures for integrating biological pathway models are primarily monolithic and involve combining each biological pathway model's software source code to build one large monolithic model that executes on a single computer. Such architectures are not scalable for modeling complex cellular functions or the whole cell. We present Cytosolve, a new computational architecture that integrates a distributed ensemble of biological pathway models and computes solutions in a parallel manner while offering ease of maintenance of the integrated model.

Post-traumatic arthritis occurs after joint injury (e.g., ACL rupture or intraarticular fracture) and makes up a substantial proportion of the population with arthritis. In previous clinical studies, patients suffering from a traumatic joint injury have shown an increased risk in osteoarthritis (OA), independent of surgical intervention to stabilize the joint. Thus, the early events post-injury have an important effect on tissue within the joint in the long term. To understand the processes involved in the onset of OA and factors leading to OA post-traumatic injury, in vitro models have been developed to isolate components of the complex processes occurring in vivo. While in vitro models do not mimic true physiologic conditions in vivo, by isolating the effects of mechanical compression, cytokine treatment, and cartilage co-cultured with adjacent tissue, in vitro models can give insight into key biological and mechanical pathways occurring in vivo. This study focuses on changes in cartilage gene and protein expression and associated cartilage matrix degradation in response to static or injurious compression of the tissue in the presence or absence of cytokines including TNF-a and IL-6.

While basic characteristics of Vorticella contraction are known, the underlying biochemical mechanism is unclear. The studies outlined here define and measure key parameters of spasmoneme performance which enable discrimination between proposed movement schemes and identification of new model parameters. Recent work has classified the spasmoneme as a power-limited machine (Upadhyaya, Baraban et al. 2007), where increases in viscous load correspond to decreases in velocity; in this work the maximum load at minimum velocity (the stall force), is measured. Work done by the stalk in contraction is shown to be dependent on its fractional change in length. This energy dependence arises from the basic underlying mechanism, and a major goal of this thesis was to characterize that mechanism by imaging the underlying structure. In the case of the Vorticella spasmoneme, imaging methods like birefringence imaging and electron microscopy, which do not require preexisting knowledge of protein identity, are particularly helpful.

Such methods should permit measurement of rare mutations in the presence of abundant wild-type copies and should be general to the human genome. A sensitivity of 2 x 10-6 for point mutations was recently achieved in human cells using a novel method of target isolation, constant denaturant capillary electrophoresis (CDCE), and high-fidelity polymerase chain reaction (hifi-PCR) (Li-Sucholeiki and Thilly, 2000). This method is applicable to 100-base pair (bp) DNA domains juxtaposed with a naturally occurring domain of a higher melting temperature, or a natural clamp. Such sequence domains represent about 9% of the human genome. To permit analysis of rare point mutations in the human genome more generally, this thesis developed a procedure in which a clamp can be ligated to any 100-bp sequence of interest. This procedure was combined with the previous method to create a new method of point mutational analysis that is not dependent on a naturally occurring clamp. To demonstrate the new method, a sequence with a natural clamp, a part of the human hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) gene (cDNA-bp 223-318), was analyzed using both the natural and ligated clamps.

It has become the treatment of choice for PD, when not adequately controlled by drug therapy. We introduced a novel robotic platform for the study of the effects of DBS on motor control in PD. Subjects performed discrete wrist movements with and without a force field. We found preliminary indication that motor learning may be taking place with stimulation, and demonstrated how robotic testing can augment existing clinical tools in evaluation of the disease. To study the effect of stimulation on movement frequency, we employed a rhythmic task that required movements of the elbow to remain within a closed shape on a phase plane. Three closed shapes required varying frequency/amplitude combinations of elbow movement. The task was performed with and without visual feedback. Analysis of data from the healthy control subjects revealed a non-monotonic relation between accuracy on the phase plane and movement speed. Further kinematic analyses, including movement intermittency and harmonicity, number and type of submovements (movement primitives) fit per movement cycle, and the effects of vision on intermittency were used to support the model we propose, whereby there exist two subtypes of rhythmic movement; small-amplitude, high-frequency movements are nearly maximally harmonic, and harness the elastic properties of the limb to achieve smoothness and accuracy, and large-amplitude, low-frequency movements share characteristics with a string of discrete movements, and make use of visual feedback to achieve smoothness and accuracy.

    "text": "Exploring the mechanome with optical tweezers and single molecule fluorescence The combination of optical tweezers and single molecule fluorescence into an instrument capable of making combined, coincident measurements adds an observable dimension that allows for the examination of the localized effects of applied forces on biological systems. This technological advance had remained elusive due to the accelerated photobleaching of fluorophores in the presence of the high photon flux of the optical trap. This problem was circumvented by alternately modulating the trapping and fluorescence excitation laser beams, a technique named IOFF. Results show that our solution extends the longevity of Cy3 fluorophores by a factor of 20 without compromising the stiffness of the optical trap. This versatile arrangement can be extended to other fluorophores and was applied to unzip a 15 base pair region of dsDNA and to induce reversible conformational changes in a dsDNA hairpin labeled with a FRET pair. Next, this work developed an immobilization strategy and two single molecule assays for the CIpX ATPase, an enzyme capable of unfolding substrates that have been targeted for proteolytic degradation. In the first assay, which employs single molecule fluorescence, CIpX was found to unfold and translocate pre-engaged GFP substrates with a time constant of 22 s at saturating ATP concentrations, a rate that is 8-fold faster than bulk measurements clouded by binding and unbinding events. The second assay measured the strength of the ClpX-substrate interaction with optical tweezers. Results show that CIpX holds on to its substrates with forces on the order of 55 pN regardless of the nature and concentration of the nucleotide in solution. ",

The rare frequency at which HSCs occur in the bone marrow under homeostatic conditions is a limiting factor in both their study and clinical use. ex vivo expansion of these cells is therefore a necessary step to maximizing their potential. In this thesis I explore the concept that signals from the extracellular matrix can direct differentiation, survival and self-renewal decisions in hematopoietic cells, and thus can provide a foundation for the design of ex vivo expansion strategies. This work is focused on the role integrins, the major class of cell-extracellular matrix adhesion molecules, play in mediating these signals to hematopoietic cells at two developmental stages. In the erythroid lineage, I show that expansion of committed erythroid progenitors is regulated by growth factor and integrin-mediated signals in temporally distinct regimes. I establish a biologically relevant role for [alpha]401 but not [alpha]501 integrins in erythropoiesis and provide evidence that erythroid differentiation and expansion are regulated by separate processes.

Epidemiological data and experimental studies have identified several risk factors for gastric cancer, including Helicobacter pylori infection, low fruit and vegetable intake, N-nitrosoamine exposure, high salt diet, and smoking. Among these risk factors, H. pylori infection is the major cause of gastric cancer. Therefore, H. pylori has been classified as a type 1 (definite) carcinogen for gastric cancer by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1994. H. pylori colonizes the human stomach and has been definitively linked to chronic gastritis. Infection in some: susceptible individuals results in serious gastric disease such as peptic ulcer or gastric cancer. The first aim of this thesis was to examine the role of different T cell subpopulations in H. pylori gastritis. Using a murine adoptive transfer model, adoptive transfer of wildtype (wt) effector T cells (TE) into H. pylori-infected lymphopenic Rag2-/- recipient mice resulted in H. pylori-associated corpus gastritis superimposed with non-specific gastroduodenitis. Cotransfer with TE and regulatory T cells (TR) from wt or IL10-/- mice reduced gastroduodenitis, but only wt TR cells reduced corpus gastritis. ",

To this end, we developed and optimized an instrument for fast fluorescence laser tracking microrheology (FLTM). This novel method aims at experimentally deriving cellular viscoelastic properties from the passive monitoring of fluorescent microspheres undergoing Brownian motion inside the tested sample. Further instrument enhancement even broadens the FLTM frequency span up to seven decades by modulating data acquisition speed or complementing FLTM with a two-particle microrheology modality. In living cells, FLTM accurately characterizes the solid-like vs. liquid-like cytoskeletal behavior from measurements based on endocytosed micron-sized beads, independently of probe size or surface chemistry. FLTM also demonstrates the existence of two distinct rheological regimes on the cell surface and in the cell interior: While the former surface investigations show power-law frequency variations of the complex shear modulus G*(co), the latter intracellular experiments identify multiple time and length scales affecting cell rheological features. Finally, FLTM evaluates frequency-specific stretch-induced cell mechanics and thus promises to broaden and diversify the scientific knowledge on mechanotransduction, from a molecular and cellular standpoint.

Its expression is induced upon exposure to alkylating agents as part of the Ada-mediated adaptive response. This member of the ac-ketoglutarate/iron(II)-dependent dioxygenase family was originally discovered to reverse directly methylated lesions formed preferentially in single-stranded regions of DNA, such as 1-methyladenine and 3- methylcytosine. Repair proceeds via an oxidative demethylation pathway, in which the aberrant methyl group is hydroxylated and spontaneously lost as formaldehyde. Since these early studies, the list of lesions repaired by AlkB through this pathway has been extended to include 1-methylguanine, 3-methylthymine, 3-ethylcytosine, and 1-ethyladenine. Furthermore, the protein possesses a second, distinct chemical mechanism through which it can repair another class of lesions, the etheno-adducts formed by the reaction of DNA with metabolites of the carcinogen vinyl chloride or with breakdown products generated by lipid oxidation. In this case, direct repair proceeds through epoxidation of the etheno bond, creating an intermediate that hydrolyzes to a glycol form and finally releases the two-carbon bridge as glyoxal, restoring the unadducted adenine or cytosine. Thus, the AlkB protein bridges the repair of alkylative lesions with those induced by oxidative stress and embodies the multi-faceted protection required to preserve genomic stability and coding information despite the constant threats to which organisms are exposed.

The failure of viral gene therapy clinical trials due to toxicity, immunogenicity, and carcinogenicity has been tragic and strongly motivates a non-viral approach. However, non-viral gene delivery is currently ineffective. Here, we show that polymeric nanoparticles composed of poly([beta]-amino esters) (PBAEs) and DNA can be formulated to be stable in the presence of serum proteins and have high gene delivery without toxicity to human primary cells. The biophysical properties of PBAE/DNA nanoparticles have good correlation to transfection efficacy when tested in the appropriate media conditions. We also show that electrostatic interactions can drive peptide coating of nanoparticles and enable ligand-specific gene delivery. A biphasic efficacy relationship exists for peptide weight ratio, overall charge ratio, and ligand length, with intermediate values of coating being optimal. A balance is required when seeking to design nanoparticles that have reduced nonspecific uptake, but increased ligand-specific uptake. We develop a high-throughput assay to quantify polymer/DNA binding as a gene delivery bottleneck and find that a biphasic relationship exists between polymer/DNA binding constant, Ka, and delivery efficacy. We also show that end-modified PBAEs can be as effective as adenovirus for gene delivery. In comparison to the previous \"gold standard\" for polymeric transfection, 25 kDa polyethylenimine, the PBAE nanoparticles presented here have 100x higher efficacy while simultaneously having 100x lower toxicity. Small structural changes were found to have dramatic effects on multiple steps of gene delivery including the DNA binding affinity, nanoparticle size, intracellular DNA uptake, and final protein expression.

These molecules, inspired from natural biomineralization systems, are now commonly selected against non-natural inorganic materials through biopanning random combinatorial peptide libraries. Unfortunately, the challenge of studying the biological inorganic interface has slowed the understanding of interactions principles, and hence limited the number of downstream applications. This work focuses on the facile study of the peptide-inorganic interface using Yeast Surface Display. The general approach is to use combinatorial selection to suggest interaction principles followed by rational design to refine understanding. In this pursuit, two material groups-II-VI semiconductors and synthetic sapphire (metal oxides)-are chosen as inorganic targets due to their technological relevance and ease of study. First, yeast surface display (YSD) was established as a broadly applicable method for studying peptide-material interactions by screening a human scFv YSD library against cadmium sulfide (CdS), a II-VI semiconductor. The presence of multiple histidine residues was found to be necessary for mediating cell binding to CdS. As a follow-up, a systematic screen with yeast displayed rationally designed peptides was performed on a panel of II-VI semiconductors and gold. Cell binding results indicated that peptide interaction was mediated by a limited number of amino acids that were influenced by locally situated residues. Interpretation of the results facilitated design of new peptides with desired material specificities. Next, the nature of peptide/metal oxide binding interface was interrogated using sapphire crystalline faces as model surfaces. ",

Design principles of biological networks and cell signaling processes pertinent to disease progression emerge from these studies. It is my hope that knowledge of these principles may provide new mechanistic insights and conceptual frameworks for thinking about therapeutic intervention into diseases such as cancer and diabetes that arise from aberrant signaling. Areas of interest have emphasized the role of scaffold proteins in protein kinase cascades, modeling relevant biophysical processes related to T cell activation, design principles of signal transduction focusing on multisite phosphorylation, quantifying the notion of signal duration and the time scale dependence of signal detection, and entropy based models of network architecture inferred from proteomics data. These problems are detailed below. The assembly of multiple signaling proteins into a complex by a scaffold protein guides many cellular decisions. Despite recent advances, the overarching principles that govern scaffold function are not well understood. We carried out a computational study using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to understand how spatial localization of kinases on a scaffold may regulate signaling under different physiological condition. Our studies identify regulatory properties of scaffold proteins that allow them to both amplify and attenuate incoming signals in different biological contexts. In a further, supplementary study, simulations also indicate that a major effect that scaffolds exert on the dynamics of cell signaling is to control how the activation of protein kinases is distributed over time[2].

These bell-shaped, or \"metakaryotic,\" nuclei are abundant in fetal tissues and neoplasias, but rare in normal adult somatic tissues. Metakaryotic nuclei employ an unusual process for division in which DNA synthesis, partial genomic condensation, and separation of the two nuclei in a cup-from-cup fashion occur concurrently, as shown by Feulgen densitometry and single-stranded DNA assays by Dr. Elena Gostjeva. This is clearly different from the sequential steps of S-phase DNA synthesis, chromatin condensation, chromosomal separation, and genomic segregation that occur in mitotic eukaryotic cells. In order to discover how a genome apparently devoid of chromosomes might be organized, this thesis focused on recognizable DNA sequences common to all chromosomes: centromeres and telomeres. Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) with pan-centromeric and pan-telomeric probes was applied to samples of human tissue. (A collaborating lab used centromeric and telomeric antibodies to confirm results.) An optimized FISH protocol was developed specifically for metakaryotic nuclei and tested in both human cell lines and eukaryotic cells as experimental controls. Staining of metakaryotic nuclei resulted in approximately 23 centromeric regions in each, unlike the expected number of 46 regions seen in eukaryotic nuclei. Many of these staining regions contained paired centromere signals, or doublets. This suggested a genomic organization of homologous chromosomes paired at their centromere regions. If this were the case, one would expect 46 telomeric signals per nuclei, if telomeres were also homologously paired. ",

Cell decisions can be triggered by subtle, transient signals that are context specific, making them hard to study by conventional experimental methods. In this thesis, we use a systems approach combining quantitative experiments with computational modeling and analysis to understand the regulation of the survival-vs-death decision. A second goal of this thesis was to develop modeling and analysis methods that enable study of signals that are transient or at intermediate activation levels. We addressed the challenge of balancing mechanistic detail and ease of interpretation in modeling by adapting fuzzy logic to analyze a previously published experimental dataset characterizing the dynamic behavior of kinase pathways governing apoptosis in human colon carcinoma cells. Simulations of our fuzzy logic model recapitulated most features of the data and generated several predictions involving pathway crosstalk and regulation. Fuzzy logic models are flexible, able to incorporate qualitative and noisy data, and powerful enough to generate not only quantitative predictions but also biological insights concerning operation of signaling networks. To study transient signals in differential-equation based models, we employed direct Lyapunov exponents (DLEs) to identify phase-space domains of high sensitivity to initial conditions. These domains delineate regions exhibiting qualitatively different transient activities that would be indistinguishable using steady-state analysis but which correspond to different outcomes. ",

Noncovalent interactions of biochemical functional groups with nanostructure surfaces can significantly disrupt biomolecular structure and function. We report a systematic study of the effect of DNA sequence on the binding interaction between gold nanoparticles and thiolated DNA (AuNp-DNA). Base specific noncovalent nucleotide adsorption on gold surfaces can affect nucleotide bioavailability in solution. Systematic investigation of DNA oligonucleotide sequence, the location of specific sequence motifs, and the effect of nanoparticle size was performed. Sequence effects on DNA coverage and oligonucleotide adsorption affinities.were studied by Langmuir isotherm analysis. The nanoparticle coverage at saturating concentrations of thiolated DNA varied with oligonucleotide sequence. Saturation coverages correlated well with complement hybridization efficiency. From this we concluded that noncovalent interactions between nucleotides and the particle surface effect both hybridization and DNA coverage and adsorption. This hypothesis was confirmed by chemical treatment of the particle surface to eliminate noncovalent interactions. Upon treatment the effect of sequence on hybridization efficiency was removed. The effect of sequence is not consistent across nanoparticle sizes. Different bases show the highest saturation coverages and hybridization efficiencies on different AuNp sizes. These results allow for sequence selection guidelines based on AuNp size for sizes ranging from 4-11nm. For smaller particles (<5nm) adenine rich sequences show the highest saturation coverage and hybridization efficiency. ",

Current research has focused on developing such vehicles using end gene expression as the benchmark. While transgene protein production is the overall objective of successful gene delivery, such qualitative treatment of gene delivery, especially for non-viral vectors, may result in unoptimized vectors and potential rate limiting steps unidentified. Quantitative analysis of the gene delivery pathway is essential for the characterization, comparison, and design of vectors. The complex nature of the mechanisms for gene delivery, particularly at the cellular level, contains multiple potentially rate limiting steps to successful gene expression. Through quantitative methodologies, vector efficacy can be related to molecular characteristics and specific processes within the gene delivery pathway. These potentially rate limiting steps include, but are not limited to, cell surface association, subcellular trafficking, endosomal escape, nuclear translocation, vector unpackaging, and gene expression. Design of synthetic gene delivery vectors seeks to develop molecular systems mimicking virus-like infection behavior, including cell membrane attachment and rapid internalization followed by endosomal escape, nuclear localization, and finally gene expression.

Current understanding of tissue differentiation mechanisms is based on studies of protein and RNAs that asymmetrically segregate between daughter cells during embryogenesis. Whether or not other types of biomolecules segregate asymmetrically has not been widely studied. In 1975, John Cairns proposed that ASCs preferentially segregate the oldest parental template DNA strands to themselves and pass on newly replicated DNA strands to their differentiating progeny in order to protect the stem cell from inheriting DNA replication mutations. This laboratory has shown non-random chromosome segregation in murine fetal fibroblasts that model asymmetric self-renewal like ASCs. In these cells, chromosomes that contain the oldest DNA strands co-segregate to the cycling daughter stem-like cells, while chromosomes with more recently replicated DNA segregate to the non-stem cell daughters. Previously, cytological methods were reported to elucidate non-random segregation in these cells. This dissertation research provides additional confirmation of the mechanism using physicochemical methods. Specifically, buoyant density-shift experiments in equilibrium CsCl density gradients were used to detect co-segregated \"immortal DNA strands\" based on incorporation of the thymidine base analogue bromodeoxyuridine.

Since these mechanosensors have been speculated to be located in several cellular domains including the cell membrane, the cytoskeleton, and the nucleus, it is necessary to achieve a detailed understanding of subcellular mechanics.

Some of these observations are brought to the attention of public health officials in the hope that an environmental cause within these communities may be discovered and subsequently eliminated. However, what appears to be a cluster of cancer cases locally may be a chance occurrence when viewed from the perspective of the entire state or region. The primary aim of this work was to obtain and analyze a data set of sufficient magnitude to provide a means to discover if distributions of cancer mortality rates among communities within a particular state, for any of the most common forms of cancer, were compatible with chance. To this end cancer mortality data for six of the largest states in the United States (California, Florida, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas) were collected, converted into mortality rates and analyzed to discover if the variations among communities could be accounted for by chance alone. These data comprised one third of all recorded deaths in the period of approximately 1969 to 1998. The 21 most common forms of adult and 6 most common forms of pediatric cancers were organized to permit analyses within each of the 6 states with regard to age (0-19, 65-84 and >/= 85 years), gender and ethnicity (European American and Non-European American descent). Key to this work was the mode of statistical analysis. For each community an expected mortality rate and its expected distribution was defined by the average mortality rate for all communities within each state and the binomial distribution, respectively. These expected distributions were summed for all communities to define the expected chance distribution of community mortality rates for each state, cancer, gender, age cohort and ethnicity. This produced nearly 800 separate \"chance\" distributions. Each of these was compared to the corresponding observed distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smimov statistical test. This test was designed to discover statistically significant differences between any two distributions. Here it was used to determine which of the nearly 800 observed distributions could not be accounted for by chance alone. Of these comparisons, 16 were found to have observed distributions significantly different from the expected by chance distributions. All 16 had distributions that exhibited greater dispersion than expected by chance, and none had distributions with less dispersion than the chance expectation. ",

The specificity involved in the HSGAG-protein interactions stems from the structural heterogeneity of HSGAGs, which are highly acidic biopolymers associated on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix. It is believed that structural specificity in the HSGAG-protein interactions determines the biological functions mediated by HSGAG-binding proteins such as basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2). A number of models have been proposed to account for the mode of FGF-FGFR interactions and the role of HSGAGs in modulating FGF2 signaling. It was hypothesized that one role played by HSGAGs was to stabilize FGF2 oligomers in a \"side-by-side\" or cis fashion for presentation to fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR). In this thesis research, we systematically examined different proposed modes of FGF2 dimerization and showed that extensive oligomerization of a FGF2 mutant protein could be achieved by oxidatively crosslinking. Heparin, a highly sulfated form of HSGAGs, was demonstrated to increase the extent of oligomerization. Therefore, the results reported here were consistent with the hypothesis that HSGAGs promoted FGF2 oligomerization in a \"side-by-side\" mode. The functional significance of a FGF2 dimer was tested using a genetically engineered dimeric FGF2 (dFGF2).

The same complexity that contributes to the diversity of GAG function has also hindered their chemical characterization. Recent progress in coupling bacterial GAG-degrading enzymes with sensitive analytical techniques has led to a revolution in understanding the structure-function relationship for an important subset of GAGs, namely heparin/heparan sulfate-like glycosaminoglycans (HSGAGs). The study of chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate (CS/DS), an equally important subset of GAGs, has lagged behind partially due to a lack of enzymatic and analytical tools akin to those developed for HSGAGs. The Flavobacterial heparinases have proven indispensable in characterizing the fine structure of HSGAGs responsible for their different biological functions. As a continuation of ongoing research, a combination of chemical modification, peptide mapping, and site-directed mutagenesis was employed to explore the role of histidine in the activity of heparinase III. Of the thirteen histidines in the enzyme, His295 and His510 were found to be critical for the degradation of heparan sulfate by heparinase III. As a first step to developing the chondroitinases as enzymatic tools for the characterization of CS/DS oligosaccharides, recombinant expression and purification schemes were developed for chondroitinase AC and B from Flactobacterium heparinum. The recombinant enzymes were characterized using biochemical techniques and kinetic parameters were determined for their respective CS/DS substrates. ",

Both classes of molecules have diverse roles in normal and pathological processes including development, cell growth, wound healing, angiogenesis, viral entry, and cancer. Taking advantage of the ability of carbohydrates to affect biological outcomes, several companies have already begun developing sugar-based structures as therapeutics for malaria and breast cancer, among others. However, the structural complexity that allows HSGAGs and N-glycans to exhibit such a wide array of activities also makes them more difficult to study than their protein and nucleotide counterparts. There are currently no effective methods for rapid synthesis of specific HSGAG or N-glycan structures, and until recently, most common analytical techniques were not useful in this field due to sensitivity constraints. Now, with advances in separation techniques and mass spectrometry, the fundamental roles of biological carbohydrates can be elucidated more efficiently. However, there is still a need for improved methodologies for studying these classes of molecules. This thesis describes the development of a novel technique for the direct isolation and sequencing of protein-binding HSGAG oligosaccharides. As a proof-of-concept, we used heparin and HSGAG-binding proteins of known specificity (fibroblast growth factor and antithrombin III), then utilized the technique to identify an oligosaccharide binder for a protein with unknown HSGAG binding specificity (endostatin).

These threats to the genetic integrity of cells are caused by exogenous and endogenous oxidizing agents and may contribute to diseases such as cancer. To better understand the role of oxidative DNA damage in these diseases, it is necessary to quantify deoxyribose oxidation both in vitro and in vivo. Current methods lack the sensitivity required to measure low concentrations of deoxyribose oxidation products. The goals of the research findings reported here is to develop a sensitive method that can accurately and reproducibly quantify 3'-phosphoglycolaldehyde (PGA), one example of a deoxyribose oxidation product, and to apply the method to quantify PGA in vitro and in cells. Given the presence of reactive carbonyl groups in many deoxyribose oxidation products, the method should be widely applicable to other studies of oxidative ])NA damage. The analytical method exploits the reactive carbonyl moiety in PGA by derivatization as a stable oxime with pentafluorobenzylhydroxylamine, followed by solvent extraction and gas chromatography/negative chemical ionization/mass spectrometry. A stable isotopically-labeled [13C2]-PGA is synthesized and used as an internal standard. The method is linear in response over the range of 30 fmol to 300 pmol and precision is verified by analysis of a synthetic, PGA-containing oligodeoxynucleotide. The limit of detection in the presence of DNA is 30 fmol of PGA. The analytical method was then applied to the quantification of PGA in purified DNA and cultured cells treated with several oxidants.

As a complement to the LC-MS method for the quantification of nucleobase deamination products, enzymatic probes were also developed for oxidative and nitrosative DNA lesions. These probes would not only allow differential quantification of the two types of DNA damage, but would also allow the lesions to be mapped in any DNA sequence by coupling their activity with the technique of ligation-mediated PCR. As an extension of the biomarker study, the effects of ONOO⁻ dose and dose-rate on the DNA damage and mutations induced in the supF gene were investigated. The observations suggest that both the dose and dose-rate at which a genetic target is exposed to ONOO⁻ substantially influence the damage and mutational response and these parameters will need to be considered in assessing the potential effects of ONOO⁻ in vivo.

However, numerous studies have revealed important differences between TIMP family members in their ability to inhibit angiogenic processes in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo despite their universal ability to inhibit matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity. To address these differences, structure-function studies were conducted to identify and characterize the anti-angiogenic domains of TIMP-2, the endogenous MMP inhibitor that uniquely inhibits capillary endothelial cell (EC) proliferation and angiogenesis in vivo. Only the carboxy-terminal domain of TIMP-2 (T2C) and not the MMP-inhibitory N-terminal domain (T2N), inhibited capillary EC proliferation. Although both T2N and T2C inhibited embryonic angiogenesis, only T2C potently inhibited mitogen-stimulated angiogenesis. These findings demonstrate that TIMP-2 possesses two distinct types of anti-angiogenic activities which can be uncoupled from each other. The anti-proliferative activity of T2C was further mapped to the 24-amino acid peptide, Loop 6, which proved to be a potent inhibitor of both embryonic and nitogen-stimulated angiogenesis in vivo. Initial studies into the mechanism(s) by which Loop 6 inhibits angiogenesis revealed that the anti-proliferative effects of Loop 6 are due, at least in part, to the inhibition of cell cycle progression and not to the induction of apoptosis. This inhibition was associated with increased levels of cell cycle inhibitor p27. Although Loop 6 did not compete with bFGF for binding to its receptor, ",

Biocompatible scaffolds assist in providing a template for cell distribution and extracellular matrix accumulation in a three-dimensional geometry. In these studies, a self-assembling peptide hydrogel is evaluated as a potential scaffold for cartilage repair using a model bovine cell source. A seeding technique is developed for 3-D encapsulation of chondrocytes in a peptide hydrogel. The chondrocyte-seeded peptide hydrogel was then evaluated cellular activities in vitro under standard culture conditions and also when subjected to dynamic compression. During 4 weeks of culture in vitro, chondrocytes seeded within the peptide hydrogel retained their morphology and developed a cartilage-like ECM rich in proteoglycans and type II collagen, indicative of a stable chondrocyte phenotype. Time dependent accumulation of this ECM was paralleled by increases in material stiffness, indicative of deposition of mechanically-functional neo-tissue. Culture of chondrocyte-seeded peptide hydrogels in ITS-supplemented medium was investigated as an alternative to high serum culture. Low serum (0.2%), ITS-supplemented medium was found to maintain high levels of cell division and extracellular matrix synthesis and accumulation, as seen in high serum culture. Furthermore, low serum, ITS medium induced minimal chondrocyte de-differentiation on the surface of the hydrogel. This is in contrast to high serum culture, where surface de-differentiation and subsequent proliferation led to a 5-10 cell thick layer that stained positive for type I collagen. ",

Given that such genetic changes may promote tumorigenesis, it is critical to identify those genetic and environmental factors that render cells susceptible to homologous recombination. Our goal is to elucidate the mechanisms of DNA damage-induced recombination and to determine the role of DNA repair enzymes in modulating homologous recombination in eukaryotic cells. Alkylating agents are abundant in our environment and are generated endogenously as normal metabolites. In addition to their mutagenic and cytotoxic effects, alkylating agents stimulate homologous recombination in eukaryotic cells. Removal of alkylated bases by DNA glycosylases, such as the Magl 3-methyladenine (3MeA) DNA glycosylase, initiates the base excision repair (BER) pathway. To investigate the molecular basis for methylation-induced homologous recombination in S. cerevisiae, intrachromosomal recombination was measured under conditions where MAGI expression levels were varied. Cells lacking Magl show increased susceptibility to methylation-induced recombination, suggesting that unrepaired 3MeA lesions induce recombination. Overexpression of M4GI also elevates recombination levels, presumably due to the accumulation of recombinogenic BER intermediates. ",

It is now becoming increasingly evident that sequence specific GAG-protein interactions play critical roles in cell growth, development, angiogenesis, cancer, anticoagulation and microbial pathogenesis. Therefore it is important to understand the specificity of glycan-protein interactions and how these specific interactions influence their structure-function relationships. This thesis addresses many challenges in this emerging area of glycomics, by taking an integrated approach that couples biophysical and biochemical methods with a bioinformatics framework to represent and process sequence information content in GAGs. With this motivation the thesis is divided into 4 components 1. Using heparin/heparan sulfate GAGs (HSGAGs) - fibroblast growth factor (FGF) as a model GAG-protein system, the first part focuses on determining the structural basis of FGF oligomerization, sequence specific FGF-HSGAG interactions and FGF-receptor (FGFR) interactions which collectively influence the specificity of HSGAG mediated FGF signaling. 2. The second part focuses on developing enzymatic tools for analysis of GAGs using chondroitinase B, HSGAG 2-0 sulfatase and 3-0 sulfotransferase as model enzymes. For each of these enzymes a theoretical model for the enzyme-substrate structural complex is developed and it is coupled with the site directed mutagenesis and biochemical studies to determine its catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity. 3. To deal with the heterogeneity and high information density of GAG sequences, an informatics based approach to decode GAG sequence information has been developed. ",

Due to a lack of effective tools to study structure-function relationship of these complex molecules, the role(s) of HLGAGs in cancer remains largely indirect and poorly understood. To study the role(s) of HLGAGs in cancer growth, metastasis and angiogenesis, tumor systems were studied using heparinases I and III which have distinct substrate specificities. Studies, focusing on the biochemistry of the heparinase active site, elucidated key interactions important for enzymatic activities, thus enabling the biological studies presented here. In vitro cell culture study with heparinases as tools clearly showed that cell surface HLGAGs are involved in regulating fundamental cellular activities including cell proliferation, invasion and adhesion. Significantly, heparinase I and III demonstrated distinct effect on these cellular activities with heparinase III inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, invasion and adhesion in selected model systems and heparinase I inhibiting these processes. Further in vivo studies in animal tumor models confirmed and expanded the distinct responses to heparinase I and III treatment. HLGAG fragments generated from heparinase treatment were found to be responsible for the effect of heparinase treatment in tumor models. Moreover, cell surface HLGAGs containing cryptic activatory and inhibitory sequence information were identified and characterized. In contrast to heparinase I- generated HLGAG fragments, heparinase III- generated HLGAG fragments were shown here to inhibit both primary tumor growth and secondary lung metastasis. ",

In this Thesis, we investigate affinity maturation of antibodies for very high affinity binding. Two single chain antigen-binding fragment (scFv) antibody systems that were engineered to obtain higher affinity interactions through directed evolution were probed using biophysical techniques to illuminate affinity modulation in proteins. First, anti-c-erbB-2 antibodies and their binding partner, the extracellular domain of the glycoprotein tumor antigen c-erbB-2, were examined.

The focus has broadened to include epigenetic mechanisms in changing gene expression. The association between chronic infection, chronic inflammation and increased cancer risk has been supported by epidemiologic studies. Data link chronic inflammation associated with infectious disease to increased cancer risk.

The basic premise of the thesis is that integrin-specific adhesion peptides, when presented in a biophysically appropriate spatial arrangement against an inert background, allow enrichment of CTPs in vitro. Comb copolymer comprising a methyl methacrylate backbone with 10-mer poly(oxyethylene) sidechains was selected as the vehicle to present small adhesion peptides at the surface. This polymer shows excellent performance in cell resistance studies and offers sufficient functionalizable sites to create high local densities of ligands. Methods for preparing comb copolymer substrates with peptides in [approx.] 300 nm² clusters with inter-ligand spacings closer than integrins were developed. This nanometer-scale clustered presentation was favorable to integrin binding. Cells were more spread on RGD peptide substrates with a higher degree of nanoscale clustering but of the same overall peptide surface density as comparable substrates with lower degree of peptide clustering. We evaluated adhesion peptides for their ability to support CFU formation of marrow-derived CTPs using colony forming unit (CFU) assay. ",

Alterations in the biosynthesis of this molecule over time could impact the ability of the tissue to perform its necessary functions. Several factors have been shown to alter the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate in cartilage; among them are age, disease, depth of tissue, and mechanical compression. Specifically, mechanical compression has been shown to have a significant effect on the sulfation pattern and chain length and number in cartilage explant studies. The mechanisms that govern these alterations, however, have not been determined. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of mechanical compression on chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis and analyze the roles of two possible mechanisms; enzyme transcription and organelle deformation. The effects of mechanical compression on the transcription rates of enzymes associated with the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate have not been previously studied. To perform this study in a bovine model, portions of the bovine genome had to be sequenced, PCR primers designed, and bulk expression levels determined. Static compression resulted in the significant up-regulation of two genes of interest: chondroitin sulfate and GalNAc 4S,6-sulfotransferase. ",

The intrinsic sequence variety stemming from the large number of building blocks that compose this biopolymer leads to substantial information density as well as to the ability to regulate a wide variety of important biological processes. With the recent and progressive emergence of biochemical and analytical tools to probe GAG structure and function, efforts can be taken to understand the role of GAGs in cell biology and in disease in the various physiological locations where GAGs can exist. As a first step to probe the functions of GAGs, the heparin/heparan sulfate-GAG (HSGAG)-fibroblast growth factor (FGF) system was examined. Understanding the role of HSGAGs in inducing FGF2 dimerization led to the development of a novel engineered protein that was found to be effective at promoting functional recovery in stroke. Subsequently, methods to isolate HSGAGs from the cell surface were optimized and the ability of HSGAGs to support FGF signaling was investigated. Cell surface HSGAGs can define the responsiveness of a given cell to FGF1 and FGF2 through multiple receptor isoforms. Stromal cell derived HSGAGs were also identified as critical regulators of tumor cell growth and metastasis, effecting not only FGF2., but also 1-integrin signaling. ",

We monitored hepatic global gene expression profiles and correlated them to histological liver lesions in H. hepaticus infected and control male A/JCr mice at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year of age. We used an Affymetrix-based oligonucleotide microarray platform on the premise that a specific genetic expression signature at isolated time points would be indicative of disease status. Model based expression index comparisons generated by dChip yielded consistent profiles of differential gene expression for H. hepaticus infected male mice with progressive liver disease versus uninfected control mice within each age group. Linear discriminant analysis and principal component analysis allowed segregation of mice based on combined age and lesion status, or age alone. Up-regulated genes present throughout the 12 month study involved inflammation, tissue repair, and host immune function. Upregulation of putative tumor and proliferation markers correlated with advancing hepatocellular dysplasia. Transcriptionally down-regulated genes in mice with liver lesions included those related to peroxisome proliferator, cholesterol, and steroid metabolism pathways. Transcriptional profiling of hepatic genes documented gene expression signatures in the livers of H. hepaticus infected male A/JCr mice with chronic progressive hepatitis and preneoplastic liver lesions, complemented the histopathological diagnosis, and suggested molecular targets for the monitoring and intervention of disease progression prior to the onset of hepatocellular neoplasia.

In particular, the finding of small amounts of chemical mutagens in cigarette smoke has led to the general hypothesis that mutagens in cigarette smoke induce oncomutations and thus account for the carcinogenic effect of cigarette smoking in human lungs. However, this hypothesis has not been tested by an assay of nuclear point mutations in lungs of smokers and nonsmokers. Mismatch amplification mutation assay (MAMA), an effective form of allele-specific PCR, was applied for detection of point mutations in TP53 bp742, bp746 and bp747, K-ras bp35 and HPRT bp508 from a total of 291 tracheal-bronchial epithelial sectors from six smokers and nine non-smokers, yielding 949 individual mutational assays. The conditions of MAMA for each target point mutations were optimized such that the sensitivity of each was equal to or below 10⁻⁵. Lung epithelial sectors of 2.3x10⁶ cells in average contained 0-200 mutant cells in general, equivalent to mutant fractions (MFs) of 0-10⁻⁴ with an exception of rare sectors with MF larger than 4x 10⁻⁴ (4.6%). Noticeably, the distributions of the MFs among sectors did not vary appreciably with the donor's smoking status. The mean MFs per lung were very similar between smokers and non-smokers for all five target mutations assayed (p >> 0.05). The mean MFs were slightly higher in females than males (p = 0.015). The mean MFs increased with age of the subjects although the correlation did not reach statistical significance due to large variances within the same age group.

The objective of this thesis was to clarify the chemistry of deoxyribose oxidation, with a focus on C4'-oxidation that gives rise to 3'- phosphoglycolate residues on the DNA backbone and releases base propenal or malondialdehyde, and to investigate the role of base propenals in the formation of an important endogenous DNA adduct, MI dG. First, an index of total deoxyribose oxidation was developed, one that provides a means to compare different oxidizing agents. This method exploits the reaction of aldehyde- and ketone-containing deoxyribose oxidation products with 14C-methoxyamine to form stable oxime derivatives that are quantified by accelerator mass spectrometry.

The development of specific molecular markers for ASCs has been difficult mainly due to the technical barriers in the identification and isolation of rare ASCs. Previously, reported transcriptional profiling studies for defining molecular features of ASCs were compromised by the use of impure ASC preparations. Thesis for this research was that the study of asymmetric self-renewal, a defining property of ASCs, might provide key clues to understanding ASC function and lead to discovery of novel molecular markers for ASCs. Fifty two self-renewal pattern associated (SRPA) genes were identified by cDNA microarray analysis with cell culture models whose self-renewal pattern could be reversibly regulated, instead of using heterogeneous ASC-enriched populations. From evaluation of whole genome transcript levels to expand the SRPA gene pool, 543 SRPA genes were discovered. Both microarray studies showed that asymmetric self-renewal associated (ASRA) genes were highly represented in ASC-enriched populations but not in embryonic stem cells. The SRPA gene expression signature successfully distinguished isolated ASC-enriched populations from non-stem cell populations by principal component analysis (PCA). ",

While the aetiology of osteoarthritis is unknown, risk factors include gender, age, obesity, and prior joint injury. Joint injuries, including tears of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and meniscus, increase the risk for the development of OA and involve both mechanical damage to cartilage, meniscus and synovial tissues, and tissue degradation associated with cytokine-induced inflammation. While the role of inflammatory cytokines in OA is still controversial, their role in rheumatoid arthritis is evidenced by the successful use of anti-TNF-ca and anti-IL-1 therapies to abrogate disease symptoms and progression. In vitro, both IL-13 and TNF-ca promote chondrocyte-mediated matrix degradation and inhibit cartilage matrix synthesis, while mechanical damage causes cell death, matrix damage, and decreased cell biosynthesis. Understanding the similarities and differences in cartilage responses to inflammatory cytokines and mechanical injury is important in understanding the catabolic-anabolic shifts that typify OA progression.

The system is comprised of microspheres encapsulating chemokines and hydrogel nanoparticles; each nanoparticle contains antigen and DC maturation signals (e.g., TLR ligands). The nanoparticles remain sequestered within the carrier microspheres but the chemokine is released at a controllable rate, creating a local chemoattractant gradient centered on each microsphere.

Many envisioned applications of CTP, such as treating large defects in bone, involve in vivo implantation of CTP attached to a scaffold, a process that creates an acute inflammatory environment that may be hostile to CTP survival. This project entails the design of a two-component polymeric implant system to aid in the healing process of bony defects by influencing cell behaviors at the implant site through the covalent modification of the implant surface with selected ligands. We investigate cellular responses of CTP on a biomaterial surface covalently modified with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and find that surface-tethered EGF (tEGF) promotes both cell spreading and survival more strongly than saturating concentrations of soluble EGF.

However, the design principles governing the construction and operation of these networks remain mostly unknown. To discover design principles in these networks, we investigated and developed a set of computational tools described below. First, we looked into the application of optimization techniques to explore network topology, parameterization, or both, and to evaluate relative fitness of networks operational strategies. In particular, we studied the ability of an enzymatic cycle to produce dynamic properties such as responsiveness and transient noise filtering. We discovered that non-linearity of the enzymatic cycle allows more effective filtering of transient noise. Furthermore, we found that networks with multiple activation steps, despite being less responsive, are better in filtering transient noise. Second, we explored a method to construct compact models of signal transduction networks based on a protein-domain network representation. This method generates models whose number of species, in the worst case, scales quadratically to the number of protein-domain sites and modification states, a tremendous saving over the combinatorial scaling in the more standard mass-action model was estimated to consist of more that 10⁷ species and was too large to simulate; however, a simplified model consists of only 132 state variables and produced intuitive behavior. The resulting models were utilized to study the roles of a scaffold protein and of a shared binding domain to pathway functions. ",

To date, no robust, efficient method for the pure, ex vivo expansion of human HSCs has been demonstrated. Previous methods primarily induced the expansion of committed hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), yielding even less pure populations of HSCs. This research was based on the hypothesis that, like for other adult stem cells (ASCs), the major barrier to expanding HSCs ex vivo is in preferentially regulating the asymmetric self-renewal of HSCs without loss in their ability to produce differentiated committed HPCs. This laboratory has shown that a p53-dependent pathway specifically controls the self-renewal pattern of several types of ASCs and thereby provides an effective means for expansion of ASCs in culture. The method, which involves the use of purine metabolites to achieve suppression of asymmetric cell kinetics, is referred to as SACK.

However, the lethal effects of these wavelengths limited their usefulness in studies of cell function, separating the contributions of protein and nucleic acid proved difficult, and scattering artifacts were a significant concern.

First, electrostatic analysis of a series of small molecule neuraminidase inhibitors was used to demonstrate that charge optimization improves the electrostatic component of the binding free energy, despite changes in binding mode and discrete chemical constraints. Additionally, chemical changes suggested by charge optimization frequently corresponded to tighter-binding inhibitors, indicating that this technique would be useful for the design of future inhibitors. Second, computational sequence and structure analysis were used to study the PDZ3-CRIPT binding interaction and a method for sequence analysis was developed to locate residues important for binding specificity. Third, computational analysis of the horseradish peroxidase active site suggested five positions as candidates for mutation, and further studies of new mutant enzymes let to ideas for the improvement of computational enzyme design procedures. Finally, both computational protein design techniques and a model of the evolutionary process were used to study the efficiency of evolution as a tool for creating new proteins in the laboratory. We identified sequences that serve as better evolutionary starting points that others and provide a general framework for considering the impact of protein structure on the allowed sequence space and therefore on the challenges that each protein presents to evolutionary protein engineering procedures.

However differentiated sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs), marked by SE-1 expression are difficult to maintain in culture while stellate cells easily activate and over-proliferate. We hypothesized that recreating a liver tissue system that captured in vivo like paracrine influences would foster survival of these cells, and predicted that stimuli resulting from flow and oxygen gradients close to physiological conditions would preserve the delicate balance between the cell types. Spheroids containing hepatoctyes with incorporated non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) were seeded into capillary bed sized channels in polycarbonate scaffolds, housed in a three-dimensional perfused system, and maintained for two weeks. Micro-flow rates of different media through the formed tissue units in scaffolds were controlled using pneumatic pumps and microfluidics. Staining and confocal imaging of endpoint tissue showed that lower flow rates closer to physiological regimes allowed the survival of SE-1+ SECs, regardless of exogenously added growth factors in the medium. Higher flow rates, exogenous growth factors, and scaffold contact were associated with activation of stellate cells (alpha-smooth muscle actin staining). ",

While the structural and physiological consequences of negative supercoiling have been well studied, technical challenges have prevented extensive examination of positively supercoiled DNA. Studies suggest that at sufficiently high levels of overwinding, DNA relieves strain by adopting an elongated structure, where the bases are positioned extrahelically and the backbones occupy the center of the helix. This transition has only been identified, however, at a degree of supercoiling substantially higher than is generated physiologically. To examine the structural changes resulting from physiological levels of positive DNA supercoiling, I have developed a method for preparing highly purified positively supercoiled plasmid substrates. Based on a method previously developed in this laboratory, this allows for preparation of large quantities of very pure, highly positively supercoiled plasmid. It also expands on earlier methods by exploiting ionic strength to modulate the direction of supercoiling introduced, allowing preparation of either positively or negatively supercoiled substrates.

My research advisor and I set out to investigate whether simple forms of inherited risk, monoallelic or multiallelic, could be excluded by analysis of familial risk for a common disease, such as colorectal cancer (CRC). First, we derived formulae that describe the risk for monogenic, multigenic, and polygenic possibilities of Mendelian inheritance. Next, we obtained an estimate of minimum lifetime risk for CRC of >0.26. Then, we examined the case of late-onset CRC, using the Swedish Family Cancer Database (1958-2002) to estimate the familial relative risk for CRC diagnosis at age 50 or older, and obtained an estimated range of 1.5 to 3.0.

Aberrant expression of the EGF receptor and its cognate ligands have been implicated in various types of cancers, hence EGF receptor autocrine activation is thought to also be involved in tumorigenesis. EGF family ligands are synthesized as membrane-anchored proteins requiring proteolytic release to form the mature soluble, receptor-binding factor. Despite the pathophysiological importance of autocrine systems, how protease-mediated ligand release quantitatively influences receptor-mediated signaling and consequent cell behavior is poorly understood. Therefore, we explored the relationship between autocrine EGF release rate and receptor-mediated ERK activation and migration in human mammary epithelial cells. A quantitative spectrum of EGF release rates was achieved using chimeric EGF ligand precursors modulated by the addition of the metalloprotease inhibitor batimastat. We found that ERK activation increased with increasing ligand release rates despite concomitant EGF receptor downregulation. ",

T7 gene expression is a particularly well suited model system because knowledge of how the phage functions is thought to be relatively complete. My work focuses on two questions in particular. First, can we address deficiencies in past simulations and measurements of bacteriophage T7 to improve models of gene expression?

To study homologous recombination in vivo, we used Fluorescent Yellow Direct Repeat (FYDR) mice in which a homologous recombination event at a transgene yields a fluorescent cell. To study homologous recombination using FYDR mice, we developed one- and two-photon in situ imaging techniques that reveal both the frequency and the sizes of isolated recombinant cell clusters within intact pancreatic tissue.

Successful delivery of DNA is a crucial first step in attaining safe and effective gene therapeutics.

Unfortunately, as with most antibiotics, the emergence of microbial resistance to tetracyclines has become a serious problem. Today, most genera examined have tetracycline-resistant isolates, although the percentage varies according to species and geographic location. Due to the emergence of resistance, tetracyclines are no longer the antibiotics of choice in treatment of many conditions, although they are still extensively used to treat a variety of bacterial infections. Substantial research efforts have been directed towards reversing tetracycline resistance in bacteria. This work describes the development of a novel anti-bacterial treatment for diseases caused by bacteria resistant to tetracycline. It was found that tetracycline-resistant bacteria expressing the TnlO gene of tetracycline resistance, upon induction with tetracycline, became extremely susceptible to destruction by the DNA-damaging anti-cancer drug cisplatin. Tetracycline-resistant bacteria grown in tetracycline and subsequently treated with cisplatin in the presence of tetracycline were killed about 10⁵-fold more effectively than wild-type bacteria and tetracycline-resistant bacteria not exposed to tetracycline. This phenomenon was observed in different strains of tetracycline-resistant E. coli. Other antibiotics tested with respective antibiotic-resistant bacteria did not produce the same effect of sensitization to cisplatin, suggesting a unique relationship among cisplatin, tetracycline and the tetracycline resistance ",

Moreover, human cancers acquire resistance to the drug, which limits its clinical utility. A paradox in the field is how loss of mismatch DNA repair leads to clinical resistance to this widely used drug. The phenomenon of cisplatin tolerance in mismatch repair deficient cells was initially discovered in E. coli, where methylation deficient dam mutants show high sensitivity to cisplatin and dam mutants with an additional mutation in either of the mismatch repair genes mutS or mutL show near wildtype levels of resistance. A prevalent explanation for this observation is the abortive repair model, which proposes that in dam mutants, where the strand discrimination signal is lost, mismatch repair attempts futile cycles of repair opposite cisplatin-DNA adducts. Previous findings have supported this model to the extent that MutS, the E. coli mismatch recognition protein, specifically recognizes DNA modified with cisplatin. However it has recently been shown that MutS binding to cisplatin adducts may contribute to toxicity by instead preventing the recombinational repair of a cisplatin-modified substrate, and we have previously shown that recombination is an essential mechanism for tolerating cisplatin damage.

The model provided a robust tool for analysis of detailed strain/stress fields induced within a single cell or cell monolayer produced by forcing one tethered microbead.

The eukaryotic cell is equipped with a dynamic frame, known as the cytoskeleton, that provides the cell's structural integrity in order to sustain and react to such forces. Therefore, understanding the mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton is an important step towards building models describing cell behavior. Filamentous actin (F-actin), as one of the major constituents of the cytoskeleton, has been the target of extensive in vitro studies to determine its mechanical properties in bulk. However, there is still a lack in the understanding of how the molecular interactions between F-actin and the proteins that arrange these filaments into networks regulate the dynamic properties of the cytoskeleton Here we present a novel, single molecule assay to test the rupture force of a complex formed by an actin binding protein (ABP) linking two actin filaments. We readily demonstrate the adaptability of this assay by testing it with two different ABPs: filamin, a crosslinker, and a-actinin, a bundler. We measured rupture forces of 28-73 pN and 30-56 pN for filamin/actin and a-actinin/actin respectively, suggesting that the former is a slightly stronger interaction. Moreover, since no ABP unfolding events were observed at our force levels, our results suggest that ABP unbinding is a more relevant mechanism than unfolding for the temporal regulation of the mechanical properties of the actin cytoskeleton. In addition, we explore the micro-scale properties of F-actin networks reconstituted in vitro. ",

This led us to study early shear effects on cell-cell adherens junctions. We found a 30±6% increase in the number of VE-cadherin molecules in the junctions. The strength of interactions of endothelial cells with surfaces coated with recombinant VE-cadherin protein also increased after laminar flow. These observations suggest that endothelial cell junction proteins respond to flow onset. The process of clustering may induce diffusion of monomers to the junction area, resulting in an overall increase in VE-cadherins in the junctions. To directly confirm the role of adherens junctions in the decrease in cell crawling speed, we used siRNA-knockdown technique to produce cells lacking VE-cadherin. These cells showed no decline in crawling speed under flow. Our interpretation is consistent with previous data on junction disassembly 8 hr after flow onset. The speed of endothelial cell crawling returns to the original level by that time, and junctional disassembly may explain that phenomenon. In order to understand better the change in VE-cadherin distribution under flow and during junction formation and remodelling, we developed a mathematical model of VE-cadherin redistribution in endothelial cells. This model allowed us to develop a quantitative framework for analysis of VE-cadherin redistribution and estimate the amount of protein in the junctions and on the apical surface. In addition to that, the model explains rapid junction disassembly in the leukocyte transmigration and junction formation in subconfluent cells. ",

To assess any potential hypotheses for this increase required knowledge of the mortality rate changes specific to each form of cancer, and the time points when these rates had changed. For this purpose, population and cancer mortality data of the U.S. were collected and organized to create age-specific mortality rates for each birth decade from the 1800s forward, delineated by the organ of incidence. Concurrently, cancer survival data were collected so as to correct for any effect of improved treatment on historical changes in cancer mortality rates. To analyze these data, a mathematical model for the three-stage process of carcinogenesis (initiation, promotion, and progression) was developed to estimate for each birth decade cohort the value of the fraction of the cohort at lifetime risk for that cancer, the value of the growth rate of the respective precancerous lesion, and the values for the mutation rates of normal and precancerous cells in the organ of incidence. This methodology permits the analysis of the potential historical effect of new chemical exposures during the last century on cancer mortality rates. These chemical exposures represent potential risk factors that determine the fraction of the population at risk of developing cancer (lifetime, primary risk factor), or that hasten death by cancer by altering either mutation or cell kinetic rates (accelerating, secondary risk factor.)

The goal of this study was to examine the progression of chondrocyte signaling responses to mechanical stimulation in 3-D culture during tissue regeneration. To investigate the role of integrins in chondrocyte mechanotransduction, function-blocking antibodies and small-molecule antagonists were used to disrupt integrin-matrix interactions during dynamic compression of chondrocytes in 3-D agarose culture. At early days in culture, blocking [alpha]v[beta]3 integrin abolished dynamic compression stimulation of proteoglycan synthesis, independent of effects in free-swell culture, while blocking [alpha]5[beta]1 integrins abolished the effect of compression only when blocking in free-swell increased proteoglycan synthesis. This suggests that disrupting [alpha]v[beta]3 and [alpha]5[beta]1 interactions with the ECM influences proteoglycan synthesis in distinct pathways and that [alpha]v[beta]3 more directly influences the mechanical response. To further distinguish individual mechanotransduction pathways, we investigated the temporal gene transcription response of chondrocytes to ramp-and-hold compression on Days 1, 10, and 28 in 3-D agarose culture. Clustered and individual gene expression profiles changed temporally and in magnitude over time in culture.

Guanine is the most frequently oxidized base in the DNA, and generation of a guanine radical cation (G'\") as an intermediate in the oxidation reaction leads to migration of a resulting cationic hole through the DNA n-stack until it is trapped at the lowest-energy sites. These sites reside at runs of guanines, such as 5'-GG-3' sequences, and are characterized by the lowest sequence-specific ionization potentials (IPs). The charge transfer mechanism suggests that hotspots of oxidative DNA damage induced by electron transfer reagents can be predicted based on the primary DNA sequence. However, preliminary data indicated that nitrosoperoxycarbonate (ONOOCO2\"), a mediator of chronic inflammation and a one-electron oxidant, displayed unusual guanine oxidation properties that were the focus of present work. As a first step in our study, we determined relative levels of guanine oxidation, induced by ONOOCO2 in all possible three-base sequence contexts (XGY) within double-stranded oligonucleotides. These levels were compared to the relative oxidation induced within the same guanines by photoactivated riboflavin, a one-electron reagent. We found that, in agreement with previous studies, photoactivated riboflavin was selective for guanines of lowest IPs located within 5'-GG-3' sequences. In contrast, ONOOCO2\" preferentially reacted with guanines located within 5'-GC-3' sequences characterized by the highest IPs. This demonstrated that that sequence-specific IP was not a determinant of guanine reactivity with ONOOCO2\". Sequence selectivities for both reagents were double-strand specific. Selectivity of ONOOCO2 for 5'-GC-3' sites was also observed in human genomic DNA after ligation-mediated PCR analysis. ",

These patterns were used to quantify relative amounts of isomeric disaccharides in a mixture. Fragmentation information is valuable for building methods for oligosaccharide sequencing, and the general method can be applied to quantify any isomers using MSn.

    "text": "Scalable computational architecture for integrating biological pathway models A grand challenge of systems biology is to model the cell. The cell is an integrated network of cellular functions. Each cellular function, such as immune response, cell division, metabolism or apoptosis, is defined by an interconnected ensemble of biological pathways. Modeling the cell or even one cellular function requires a computational architecture that integrates multiple biological pathway models in a scalable manner while ensuring minimal effort to maintain the resulting integrated model. Scalable is defined as the ease in which more and more biological pathway models can be integrated. Current architectures for integrating biological pathway models are primarily monolithic and involve combining each biological pathway model's software source code to build one large monolithic model that executes on a single computer. Such architectures are not scalable for modeling complex cellular functions or the whole cell. We present Cytosolve, a new computational architecture that integrates a distributed ensemble of biological pathway models and computes solutions in a parallel manner while offering ease of maintenance of the integrated model. The individual biological pathway models can be represented in SBML, CellML or in any number of formats. The EGFR model of Kholodenko with known solutions is used to compare the Cytosolve solution and computational times with a known monolithic approach. A new integrative model of the interferon (IFN) response to virus infection is developed using Cytosolve. Each model within the integrated model, spans different time scales, is created by different authors from four countries and three continents across different disciplines, is written in different software codes, and is built on different hardware platforms.

    "text": "Cartilage response to in vitro models of injury in combination with growth factor and antioxidant treatments Approximately one in five Americans is affected by arthritis, making it one of the most prevalent diseases and the leading cause of disability in the United States. Post-traumatic arthritis occurs after joint injury (e.g., ACL rupture or intraarticular fracture) and makes up a substantial proportion of the population with arthritis. In previous clinical studies, patients suffering from a traumatic joint injury have shown an increased risk in osteoarthritis (OA), independent of surgical intervention to stabilize the joint. Thus, the early events post-injury have an important effect on tissue within the joint in the long term. To understand the processes involved in the onset of OA and factors leading to OA post-traumatic injury, in vitro models have been developed to isolate components of the complex processes occurring in vivo. While in vitro models do not mimic true physiologic conditions in vivo, by isolating the effects of mechanical compression, cytokine treatment, and cartilage co-cultured with adjacent tissue, in vitro models can give insight into key biological and mechanical pathways occurring in vivo. This study focuses on changes in cartilage gene and protein expression and associated cartilage matrix degradation in response to static or injurious compression of the tissue in the presence or absence of cytokines including TNF-a and IL-6. In addition, normal or injuriously compressed cartilage explants were co-cultured with injured (excised) joint capsule tissue, another in vitro model of post-traumatic cellular behavior. Both young bovine cartilage and human cartilage from a wide range of ages were used. The growth factors insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and Osteogenic protein-i (OP-1), as well as the antioxidant, superoxide dismutase mimetic (SODm), were tested to examine if they had the capability to abrogate the negative effects of these injury models.

Quantitative features, including intensity, timing, and duration of phosphorylation of particular residues play a role in determining cellular response. Mass spectrometry has been previously used to identify and catalog phosphorylation sites or quantify the phosphorylation dynamics of proteins in cell signaling networks. However, identification of phosphorylation sites presents little insight on cellular processes and quantification of phosphorylation dynamics of whole proteins masks the different roles that several phosphorylation sites within one protein have in the network. We have designed a mass spectrometry technique allowing site-specific quantification of dynamic phosphorylation in the cell. We have applied this technique to study signaling events triggered by different members of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family. Self organizing maps (SOMs) analysis of our data has highlighted potential biological functions for phosphorylation sites previously unrelated to EGFR signaling and identified network modules regulated by different combinations of EGFR family members. Partial least square regression (PLSR) analysis of our data identified combination of signals strongly correlating with cellular proliferation and migration. ",

The spasmoneme of the protozoan, Vorticella convallaria, is a model molecular spring, relying on energy stored in protein interactions to power contraction over a few hundred micrometers in a few milliseconds. While basic characteristics of Vorticella contraction are known, the underlying biochemical mechanism is unclear. The studies outlined here define and measure key parameters of spasmoneme performance which enable discrimination between proposed movement schemes and identification of new model parameters. Recent work has classified the spasmoneme as a power-limited machine (Upadhyaya, Baraban et al. 2007), where increases in viscous load correspond to decreases in velocity; in this work the maximum load at minimum velocity (the stall force), is measured. Work done by the stalk in contraction is shown to be dependent on its fractional change in length. This energy dependence arises from the basic underlying mechanism, and a major goal of this thesis was to characterize that mechanism by imaging the underlying structure. In the case of the Vorticella spasmoneme, imaging methods like birefringence imaging and electron microscopy, which do not require preexisting knowledge of protein identity, are particularly helpful.

Citrobacter rodentium is a well-characterized model of infectious colitis with particular usefulness for modeling human diarrheal disease or inflammatory bowel disease. Infection with Helicobacter hepaticus is subclinical and persistent in C57BL/6 mice, but causes disease in susceptible strains and immunodeficient mice. To test the hypothesis that subclinical persistent infection modulates the host response to diarrheal disease a polymicrobial mouse model utilizing H. hepaticus and C. rodentium was developed and characterized. Concurrent infection has been shown to modulate disease outcome through several mechanisms including: cross-reactivity between viral antigens; shifting T cell response from Th1 to Th2 by helminth infection; and induction of regulatory T cells that suppress host response. In this new model of polymicrobial infection, a new paradigm in which persistent infection prolonged the course of acute colitis associated with a deviation from Thl-biased disease to Th17 was observed.

Such methods should permit measurement of rare mutations in the presence of abundant wild-type copies and should be general to the human genome. A sensitivity of 2 x 10-6 for point mutations was recently achieved in human cells using a novel method of target isolation, constant denaturant capillary electrophoresis (CDCE), and high-fidelity polymerase chain reaction (hifi-PCR) (Li-Sucholeiki and Thilly, 2000). This method is applicable to 100-base pair (bp) DNA domains juxtaposed with a naturally occurring domain of a higher melting temperature, or a natural clamp. Such sequence domains represent about 9% of the human genome. To permit analysis of rare point mutations in the human genome more generally, this thesis developed a procedure in which a clamp can be ligated to any 100-bp sequence of interest. This procedure was combined with the previous method to create a new method of point mutational analysis that is not dependent on a naturally occurring clamp. To demonstrate the new method, a sequence with a natural clamp, a part of the human hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) gene (cDNA-bp 223-318), was analyzed using both the natural and ligated clamps. A sensitivity of 2 x 10-5 in human cells was demonstrated using the ligated clamp as opposed to 5 x 10-6 using the natural clamp. ",

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical intervention by which neural structures are stimulated electrically by an implanted pacemaker. It has become the treatment of choice for PD, when not adequately controlled by drug therapy. We introduced a novel robotic platform for the study of the effects of DBS on motor control in PD. Subjects performed discrete wrist movements with and without a force field. We found preliminary indication that motor learning may be taking place with stimulation, and demonstrated how robotic testing can augment existing clinical tools in evaluation of the disease. To study the effect of stimulation on movement frequency, we employed a rhythmic task that required movements of the elbow to remain within a closed shape on a phase plane. Three closed shapes required varying frequency/amplitude combinations of elbow movement. The task was performed with and without visual feedback. Analysis of data from the healthy control subjects revealed a non-monotonic relation between accuracy on the phase plane and movement speed. Further kinematic analyses, including movement intermittency and harmonicity, number and type of submovements (movement primitives) fit per movement cycle, and the effects of vision on intermittency were used to support the model we propose, whereby there exist two subtypes of rhythmic movement; small-amplitude, high-frequency movements are nearly maximally harmonic, and harness the elastic properties of the limb to achieve smoothness and accuracy, and large-amplitude, low-frequency movements share characteristics with a string of discrete movements, and make use of visual feedback to achieve smoothness and accuracy.

This technological advance had remained elusive due to the accelerated photobleaching of fluorophores in the presence of the high photon flux of the optical trap. This problem was circumvented by alternately modulating the trapping and fluorescence excitation laser beams, a technique named IOFF. Results show that our solution extends the longevity of Cy3 fluorophores by a factor of 20 without compromising the stiffness of the optical trap. This versatile arrangement can be extended to other fluorophores and was applied to unzip a 15 base pair region of dsDNA and to induce reversible conformational changes in a dsDNA hairpin labeled with a FRET pair. Next, this work developed an immobilization strategy and two single molecule assays for the CIpX ATPase, an enzyme capable of unfolding substrates that have been targeted for proteolytic degradation. In the first assay, which employs single molecule fluorescence, CIpX was found to unfold and translocate pre-engaged GFP substrates with a time constant of 22 s at saturating ATP concentrations, a rate that is 8-fold faster than bulk measurements clouded by binding and unbinding events. The second assay measured the strength of the ClpX-substrate interaction with optical tweezers. Results show that CIpX holds on to its substrates with forces on the order of 55 pN regardless of the nature and concentration of the nucleotide in solution. ",

The rare frequency at which HSCs occur in the bone marrow under homeostatic conditions is a limiting factor in both their study and clinical use. ex vivo expansion of these cells is therefore a necessary step to maximizing their potential. In this thesis I explore the concept that signals from the extracellular matrix can direct differentiation, survival and self-renewal decisions in hematopoietic cells, and thus can provide a foundation for the design of ex vivo expansion strategies. This work is focused on the role integrins, the major class of cell-extracellular matrix adhesion molecules, play in mediating these signals to hematopoietic cells at two developmental stages.

Epidemiological data and experimental studies have identified several risk factors for gastric cancer, including Helicobacter pylori infection, low fruit and vegetable intake, N-nitrosoamine exposure, high salt diet, and smoking. Among these risk factors, H. pylori infection is the major cause of gastric cancer. Therefore, H. pylori has been classified as a type 1 (definite) carcinogen for gastric cancer by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1994. H. pylori colonizes the human stomach and has been definitively linked to chronic gastritis. Infection in some: susceptible individuals results in serious gastric disease such as peptic ulcer or gastric cancer. The first aim of this thesis was to examine the role of different T cell subpopulations in H. pylori gastritis. Using a murine adoptive transfer model, adoptive transfer of wildtype (wt) effector T cells (TE) into H. pylori-infected lymphopenic Rag2-/- recipient mice resulted in H. pylori-associated corpus gastritis superimposed with non-specific gastroduodenitis.

To this end, we developed and optimized an instrument for fast fluorescence laser tracking microrheology (FLTM). This novel method aims at experimentally deriving cellular viscoelastic properties from the passive monitoring of fluorescent microspheres undergoing Brownian motion inside the tested sample. Further instrument enhancement even broadens the FLTM frequency span up to seven decades by modulating data acquisition speed or complementing FLTM with a two-particle microrheology modality. In living cells, FLTM accurately characterizes the solid-like vs. liquid-like cytoskeletal behavior from measurements based on endocytosed micron-sized beads, independently of probe size or surface chemistry. FLTM also demonstrates the existence of two distinct rheological regimes on the cell surface and in the cell interior: While the former surface investigations show power-law frequency variations of the complex shear modulus G*(co), the latter intracellular experiments identify multiple time and length scales affecting cell rheological features. Finally, FLTM evaluates frequency-specific stretch-induced cell mechanics and thus promises to broaden and diversify the scientific knowledge on mechanotransduction, from a molecular and cellular standpoint.

Its expression is induced upon exposure to alkylating agents as part of the Ada-mediated adaptive response. This member of the ac-ketoglutarate/iron(II)-dependent dioxygenase family was originally discovered to reverse directly methylated lesions formed preferentially in single-stranded regions of DNA, such as 1-methyladenine and 3- methylcytosine. Repair proceeds via an oxidative demethylation pathway, in which the aberrant methyl group is hydroxylated and spontaneously lost as formaldehyde. Since these early studies, the list of lesions repaired by AlkB through this pathway has been extended to include 1-methylguanine, 3-methylthymine, 3-ethylcytosine, and 1-ethyladenine. Furthermore, the protein possesses a second, distinct chemical mechanism through which it can repair another class of lesions, the etheno-adducts formed by the reaction of DNA with metabolites of the carcinogen vinyl chloride or with breakdown products generated by lipid oxidation. In this case, direct repair proceeds through epoxidation of the etheno bond, creating an intermediate that hydrolyzes to a glycol form and finally releases the two-carbon bridge as glyoxal, restoring the unadducted adenine or cytosine. Thus, the AlkB protein bridges the repair of alkylative lesions with those induced by oxidative stress and embodies the multi-faceted protection required to preserve genomic stability and coding information despite the constant threats to which organisms are exposed.

The failure of viral gene therapy clinical trials due to toxicity, immunogenicity, and carcinogenicity has been tragic and strongly motivates a non-viral approach. However, non-viral gene delivery is currently ineffective. Here, we show that polymeric nanoparticles composed of poly([beta]-amino esters) (PBAEs) and DNA can be formulated to be stable in the presence of serum proteins and have high gene delivery without toxicity to human primary cells. The biophysical properties of PBAE/DNA nanoparticles have good correlation to transfection efficacy when tested in the appropriate media conditions. We also show that electrostatic interactions can drive peptide coating of nanoparticles and enable ligand-specific gene delivery. A biphasic efficacy relationship exists for peptide weight ratio, overall charge ratio, and ligand length, with intermediate values of coating being optimal. A balance is required when seeking to design nanoparticles that have reduced nonspecific uptake, but increased ligand-specific uptake. We develop a high-throughput assay to quantify polymer/DNA binding as a gene delivery bottleneck and find that a biphasic relationship exists between polymer/DNA binding constant, Ka, and delivery efficacy. We also show that end-modified PBAEs can be as effective as adenovirus for gene delivery. In comparison to the previous \"gold standard\" for polymeric transfection, 25 kDa polyethylenimine, the PBAE nanoparticles presented here have 100x higher efficacy while simultaneously having 100x lower toxicity. Small structural changes were found to have dramatic effects on multiple steps of gene delivery including the DNA binding affinity, nanoparticle size, intracellular DNA uptake, and final protein expression.

These molecules, inspired from natural biomineralization systems, are now commonly selected against non-natural inorganic materials through biopanning random combinatorial peptide libraries. Unfortunately, the challenge of studying the biological inorganic interface has slowed the understanding of interactions principles, and hence limited the number of downstream applications. This work focuses on the facile study of the peptide-inorganic interface using Yeast Surface Display. The general approach is to use combinatorial selection to suggest interaction principles followed by rational design to refine understanding. In this pursuit, two material groups-II-VI semiconductors and synthetic sapphire (metal oxides)-are chosen as inorganic targets due to their technological relevance and ease of study. First, yeast surface display (YSD) was established as a broadly applicable method for studying peptide-material interactions by screening a human scFv YSD library against cadmium sulfide (CdS), a II-VI semiconductor. The presence of multiple histidine residues was found to be necessary for mediating cell binding to CdS. As a follow-up, a systematic screen with yeast displayed rationally designed peptides was performed on a panel of II-VI semiconductors and gold. Cell binding results indicated that peptide interaction was mediated by a limited number of amino acids that were influenced by locally situated residues. Interpretation of the results facilitated design of new peptides with desired material specificities. Next, the nature of peptide/metal oxide binding interface was interrogated using sapphire crystalline faces as model surfaces. ",

Areas of interest have emphasized the role of scaffold proteins in protein kinase cascades, modeling relevant biophysical processes related to T cell activation, design principles of signal transduction focusing on multisite phosphorylation, quantifying the notion of signal duration and the time scale dependence of signal detection, and entropy based models of network architecture inferred from proteomics data. These problems are detailed below. The assembly of multiple signaling proteins into a complex by a scaffold protein guides many cellular decisions. Despite recent advances, the overarching principles that govern scaffold function are not well understood. We carried out a computational study using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to understand how spatial localization of kinases on a scaffold may regulate signaling under different physiological condition. Our studies identify regulatory properties of scaffold proteins that allow them to both amplify and attenuate incoming signals in different biological contexts. In a further, supplementary study, simulations also indicate that a major effect that scaffolds exert on the dynamics of cell signaling is to control how the activation of protein kinases is distributed over time[2].

Metakaryotic nuclei employ an unusual process for division in which DNA synthesis, partial genomic condensation, and separation of the two nuclei in a cup-from-cup fashion occur concurrently, as shown by Feulgen densitometry and single-stranded DNA assays by Dr. Elena Gostjeva. This is clearly different from the sequential steps of S-phase DNA synthesis, chromatin condensation, chromosomal separation, and genomic segregation that occur in mitotic eukaryotic cells. In order to discover how a genome apparently devoid of chromosomes might be organized, this thesis focused on recognizable DNA sequences common to all chromosomes: centromeres and telomeres. Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) with pan-centromeric and pan-telomeric probes was applied to samples of human tissue. (A collaborating lab used centromeric and telomeric antibodies to confirm results.) An optimized FISH protocol was developed specifically for metakaryotic nuclei and tested in both human cell lines and eukaryotic cells as experimental controls. Staining of metakaryotic nuclei resulted in approximately 23 centromeric regions in each, unlike the expected number of 46 regions seen in eukaryotic nuclei. Many of these staining regions contained paired centromere signals, or doublets. This suggested a genomic organization of homologous chromosomes paired at their centromere regions. If this were the case, one would expect 46 telomeric signals per nuclei, if telomeres were also homologously paired. ",

In this thesis, we use a systems approach combining quantitative experiments with computational modeling and analysis to understand the regulation of the survival-vs-death decision.

We addressed the challenge of balancing mechanistic detail and ease of interpretation in modeling by adapting fuzzy logic to analyze a previously published experimental dataset characterizing the dynamic behavior of kinase pathways governing apoptosis in human colon carcinoma cells. Simulations of our fuzzy logic model recapitulated most features of the data and generated several predictions involving pathway crosstalk and regulation. Fuzzy logic models are flexible, able to incorporate qualitative and noisy data, and powerful enough to generate not only quantitative predictions but also biological insights concerning operation of signaling networks. To study transient signals in differential-equation based models, we employed direct Lyapunov exponents (DLEs) to identify phase-space domains of high sensitivity to initial conditions.

We report a systematic study of the effect of DNA sequence on the binding interaction between gold nanoparticles and thiolated DNA (AuNp-DNA). Base specific noncovalent nucleotide adsorption on gold surfaces can affect nucleotide bioavailability in solution. Systematic investigation of DNA oligonucleotide sequence, the location of specific sequence motifs, and the effect of nanoparticle size was performed. Sequence effects on DNA coverage and oligonucleotide adsorption affinities.were studied by Langmuir isotherm analysis. The nanoparticle coverage at saturating concentrations of thiolated DNA varied with oligonucleotide sequence. Saturation coverages correlated well with complement hybridization efficiency. From this we concluded that noncovalent interactions between nucleotides and the particle surface effect both hybridization and DNA coverage and adsorption. This hypothesis was confirmed by chemical treatment of the particle surface to eliminate noncovalent interactions. Upon treatment the effect of sequence on hybridization efficiency was removed. The effect of sequence is not consistent across nanoparticle sizes. Different bases show the highest saturation coverages and hybridization efficiencies on different AuNp sizes. These results allow for sequence selection guidelines based on AuNp size for sizes ranging from 4-11nm.

Second, the development of protocols for the production, preparation, and flow support of these scaffolds. And third, the employment of standard cell culture methodologies to test the ability of these scaffolds to support liver tissue cultures. Initial cell culture experiments showed similar rates of albumin production in the polymer disk scaffolds compared to cells in silicon-chip scaffolds under appropriately scaled flow conditions, indicating that the polymer scaffolds maintain functioning liver tissue. Further, histology sections of liver tissue grown on these polymer scaffolds show organization of cells into structures reminiscent of in vivo liver. The results of this study show that 3D-printed porous polymer scaffolds have great potential for use as biodegradable tissue culture support devices.

As a first step in the development of tools to study HLGAG structure, biochemical studies were completed on the heparinases, a family of three HLGAG-degrading enzymes from Flavobacterium heparinum. With heparinase I, it was found that calcium is a necessary cofactor for optimal activity and that two putative calcium coordinating motifs exist in heparinase I. With heparinase II, a single cysteine and three histidines were found to be critical for proper enzymatic function. Finally, with heparinase III, two histidines were found to be catalytically important. ",

Current research has focused on developing such vehicles using end gene expression as the benchmark. While transgene protein production is the overall objective of successful gene delivery, such qualitative treatment of gene delivery, especially for non-viral vectors, may result in unoptimized vectors and potential rate limiting steps unidentified. Quantitative analysis of the gene delivery pathway is essential for the characterization, comparison, and design of vectors. The complex nature of the mechanisms for gene delivery, particularly at the cellular level, contains multiple potentially rate limiting steps to successful gene expression. Through quantitative methodologies, vector efficacy can be related to molecular characteristics and specific processes within the gene delivery pathway. These potentially rate limiting steps include, but are not limited to, cell surface association, subcellular trafficking, endosomal escape, nuclear translocation, vector unpackaging, and gene expression. Design of synthetic gene delivery vectors seeks to develop molecular systems mimicking virus-like infection behavior, including cell membrane attachment and rapid internalization followed by endosomal escape, nuclear localization, and finally gene expression. To explore such opportunities for vector optimization and design, a model human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line by sets of transfection agents complexed with a plasmid. Time courses of plasmid numbers were determined both from whole cells and from isolated nuclei by real-time quantitative PCR. ",

Current understanding of tissue differentiation mechanisms is based on studies of protein and RNAs that asymmetrically segregate between daughter cells during embryogenesis. Whether or not other types of biomolecules segregate asymmetrically has not been widely studied. In 1975, John Cairns proposed that ASCs preferentially segregate the oldest parental template DNA strands to themselves and pass on newly replicated DNA strands to their differentiating progeny in order to protect the stem cell from inheriting DNA replication mutations. This laboratory has shown non-random chromosome segregation in murine fetal fibroblasts that model asymmetric self-renewal like ASCs. In these cells, chromosomes that contain the oldest DNA strands co-segregate to the cycling daughter stem-like cells, while chromosomes with more recently replicated DNA segregate to the non-stem cell daughters. Previously, cytological methods were reported to elucidate non-random segregation in these cells. This dissertation research provides additional confirmation of the mechanism using physicochemical methods. Specifically, buoyant density-shift experiments in equilibrium CsCl density gradients were used to detect co-segregated \"immortal DNA strands\" based on incorporation of the thymidine base analogue bromodeoxyuridine. In addition, DNA from cells undergoing non-random mitotic chromosome segregation was analyzed for unique DNA base modifications and global structural modifications (by HPLC and melting temperature analyses). To date, these studies show no significant differences compared to control randomly segregated DNA. Components of the mitotic chromosome separation ",

Intracellular mechanosensors are thought to be activated by conformational changes induced by local cellular deformations. Since these mechanosensors have been speculated to be located in several cellular domains including the cell membrane, the cytoskeleton, and the nucleus, it is necessary to achieve a detailed understanding of subcellular mechanics. In this work, we present novel methods to independently quantify cytoskeletal displacements, mechanical coupling between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix, and nuclear mechanics based on high resolution tracking of cellular structures and receptor bound magnetic beads in response to applied strain or microscopic forces. These methods were applied to study the effects of several human disease associated mutations on subcellular mechanics and to examine the interaction between known protein function and specific changes in cellular mechanical properties and mechanotransduction pathways. Initial experiments were targeted to the role of membrane adhesion receptors. Experiments with cells expressing a mutant form of the integrin-associated molecule tetraspanin CD151 revealed that CD151 plays a key role in selectively strengthening α6βl integrin-mediated adhesion to laminin-1. We then studied cytoplasmic behavior using cells from mice with an αB-Crystallin mutation (R120G) that causes desmin-related myopathy.

Studying hepatotoxicity in vitro is a challenging task because hepatocytes, the metabolically active cells of the liver, are very difficult to maintain in culture. After just 24 hours, the cells detach from the plate and die, and even if they survive they usually do not express the metabolic functions which they have in vivo. It has been observed by others that culturing hepatocytes between two layers of collagen type I maintains in vivo-like morphology and also many drug metabolizing enzymes for weeks. In spite of the research examining drug metabolism in collagen sandwiches, there are very few studies evaluating this system for investigating hepatotoxicity. We cultured primary rat hepatocytes in the collagen sandwich configuration and our goal was to optimize this system for long-term studies and to examine toxicity of a variety of hepatotoxins. By measuring secretions of urea and albumin, and P4501A activity, we determined the optimal cell density to be 50,000 cells/cm2. We also evaluated the need for epidermal growth factor (EGF) in our cultures, by comparing urea and albumin secretions in cultures grown with and without EGF. The cultures without EGF had significantly less secretion of both urea and albumin just two days after plating. Therefore, we decided to include EGF in the medium.

    "text": "Detection and characterization of rat hepatic stellate cells in a 3-dimensional, perfused, liver bioreactor One of the major challenges in liver research today lay in the understanding of the complex relationship between liver structure and function. The highly orchestrated events that take place in the liver to maintain homeostasis require the presence of all liver cell types. In vivo experiments offer only a snapshot of the liver, and usually involve perturbation of normal function through injury or experimental disease. The role of cell-cell interactions in maintaining normal liver function is far less understood than in pathological conditions. This may be because of the lack of methods in monitoring normal function in vivo. Culturing systems may capture pieces of the puzzle, but often capture only two cell types, and involve mediators presented to the cells in concentrations much higher than physiological values. In addition, the liver lobule contains a 3-dimensional metabolic zonation, and liver cell types comprise a heterogeneous population from the portal triad where the blood flows into the sinusoids to the central vein area where the blood flows out of the sinusoids. Liver cell types are dynamic responders to environmental cues from soluble factors to heterotypic cell interactions, to extracellular matrix proteins. Therefore, a system that serves to promote the health of all liver cell types through a 3-dimensional, perfused scaffold, and allows for self-organization of the liver cells in response to the engineered environment, would serve as a useful tool in understanding some of these complex, orchestrated events. In the research presented here, methods were developed to detect and characterize the heterogeneous population that makes up the hepatic stellate cell population inside the liver bioreactor (Griffith et. al).

Adult stem cells (ASC), which play the prime role in the maintenance and restoration of tissues, are thought to hold great potential for the advancement of medicine. It has been postulated that adult stem cells are able to retain \"immortal\" DNA template strands over successive generations by non-random chromosome co-segregation, and in so doing, to protect the long-term genomic fidelity of whole tissue compartments. The investigation of this theory may yield insights into areas such as the development of cancer and the process of aging. In addition, it may lead to the discovery of an effective method for the unique identification of adult stem cells, the study of which has thus far suffered from the lack of unique identifiers. Thus, the goal of this research was to develop an assay for the detection of immortal DNA strand co-segregation that could be applied to the detection and analysis of adult stem cells. It is proposed that such an assay may in itself serve as a unique identification method for adult stem cells. In this thesis, the development of such an assay is described. This assay, referred to as the label release assay, has provided further evidence for the existence of immortal strand co-segregation in model cell lines, and will potentially be useful in the study of adult stem cells in tissues.

This polymer has the unique properties of being cell resistant and chemically versatile such that various cell ligands can be coupled to its side chains. These properties allow adhesion through specific cell receptors to be studied without the effect of background adhesion to adsorbed proteins. By taking advantage of the ability to target specific receptors the comb polymer could be used as a powerful sorting tool. Sorting could be accomplished by finding cell type specific adhesion ligands. Several possible such ligands were screened. A ligand containing the tripeptide sequence RGD was found to elicit a strong cell adhesion response. However, this ligand is adherent to many cell types of the liver and would not be suitable for sorting purposes. Other cell type specific ligands tested showed little to no affinity for liver cell adhesion. Additionally, the comb was utilized to study α₅β₁ integrin-specific hepatocyte adhesion and the effect of Epidermal Growth Factor on adhesion. α₅β₁ integrin adhesion was mediated using a novel branched peptide, SynKRGD. This peptide consists of a linear peptide sequence containing RGDSP and the synergy site sequence PHSRN connected by the sequence GGKGGG. By utilizing the amine side group of Lysine a GGC branch was added.

A variety of in vitro culture systems have been developed to address different aspects of liver physiology and architecture in order to recreate the microenvironment. These in vitro co-culture strategies have been limited by their inability to systematically characterize the addition of non-parenchymal cells. In this dissertation, I use gene expression levels quantified by real-time RT-PCR to determine tissue composition. The identified genes demonstrate significant cell-type specificity, magnitude, and stability of expression in vivo and throughout each step of cell isolation process. In the course of this development, we establish protocols to accurately isolate and count an enriched fraction of primary NPC's. Experiments on the perfusion and isolation process prove that there exists an inverse correlation between perfusion flow rate and NPC yield and viability. Further, we have characterized the tissue composition of each step in the cell isolation process and the resulting NPC population to confirm that a significant number of each NPC type is delivered to in vitro co-culture. System output analysis of spheroids co-cultured at physiological ratios and seeded into the milliF bioreactor shows the presence of stellate cells, but the absence of endothelial (EC) and kupffer cells (KC). The same analysis of 2D collagen gel sandwiches shows the presence of all NPC cell types.

This work expands on the development of microfluidic scaffolds for vascular tissue engineering applications by employing microfabrication techniques. Unlike previous efforts, this work focuses on fabricating this scaffolds from poly(glycerol-sebacate) (PGS), a novel biodegradable elastomer with superior mechanical properties. The transport properties of oxygen and carbon dioxide in PGS were measured through a series of time-lag diffusion experiments. The results of these measurements were used to calculate a characteristic length scale for oxygen diffusion limits in PGS scaffolds. Microfluidic scaffolds were then produced using fabrication techniques specific for PGS. Initial efforts have resulted in solid PGS-based scaffolds with biomimetic fluid flow and capillary channels on the order of 10 microns in width. These scaffolds have also been seeded with endothelial cells and perfused continuously in culture for up to 14 days resulting in partially confluent channels. More complex fabrication techniques were also demonstrated. A novel electrodeposition technique was used in the fabrication of biomimetic microfluidic masters. Thin-walled devices were also synthesized to accommodate the relatively low gas permeability of PGS. ",

Epidemiological studies have shown a correlation between exposure to AFBI and incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Mutations in p53 are observed in over 50% of the HCC samples studied, and a unique mutational hotspot occurs at the third position of codon 249 in this gene, yielding almost exclusively GC to TA transversions. It is of interest to evaluate the mutagenic properties of specific chemical structures of AFBI adducts in order to determine which of these may be responsible for the mutations that may play a role in the formation of HCC.

Some of these observations are brought to the attention of public health officials in the hope that an environmental cause within these communities may be discovered and subsequently eliminated. However, what appears to be a cluster of cancer cases locally may be a chance occurrence when viewed from the perspective of the entire state or region. The primary aim of this work was to obtain and analyze a data set of sufficient magnitude to provide a means to discover if distributions of cancer mortality rates among communities within a particular state, for any of the most common forms of cancer, were compatible with chance. To this end cancer mortality data for six of the largest states in the United States (California, Florida, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas) were collected, converted into mortality rates and analyzed to discover if the variations among communities could be accounted for by chance alone. These data comprised one third of all recorded deaths in the period of approximately 1969 to 1998. The 21 most common forms of adult and 6 most common forms of pediatric cancers were organized to permit analyses within each of the 6 states with regard to age (0-19, 65-84 and >/= 85 years), gender and ethnicity (European American and Non-European American descent). Key to this work was the mode of statistical analysis. For each community an expected mortality rate and its expected distribution was defined by the average mortality rate for all communities within each state and the binomial distribution, respectively. These expected distributions were summed for all communities to define the expected chance distribution of community mortality rates for each state, cancer, gender, age cohort and ethnicity. This produced nearly 800 separate \"chance\" distributions. Each of these was compared to the corresponding observed distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smimov statistical test. This test was designed to discover statistically significant differences between any two distributions. Here it was used to determine which of the nearly 800 observed distributions could not be accounted for by chance alone. Of these comparisons, 16 were found to have observed distributions significantly different from the expected by chance distributions. All 16 had distributions that exhibited greater dispersion than expected by chance, and none had distributions with less dispersion than the chance expectation. ",

The specificity involved in the HSGAG-protein interactions stems from the structural heterogeneity of HSGAGs, which are highly acidic biopolymers associated on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix. It is believed that structural specificity in the HSGAG-protein interactions determines the biological functions mediated by HSGAG-binding proteins such as basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2). A number of models have been proposed to account for the mode of FGF-FGFR interactions and the role of HSGAGs in modulating FGF2 signaling. It was hypothesized that one role played by HSGAGs was to stabilize FGF2 oligomers in a \"side-by-side\" or cis fashion for presentation to fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR). In this thesis research, we systematically examined different proposed modes of FGF2 dimerization and showed that extensive oligomerization of a FGF2 mutant protein could be achieved by oxidatively crosslinking. Heparin, a highly sulfated form of HSGAGs, was demonstrated to increase the extent of oligomerization. Therefore, the results reported here were consistent with the hypothesis that HSGAGs promoted FGF2 oligomerization in a \"side-by-side\" mode.

The same complexity that contributes to the diversity of GAG function has also hindered their chemical characterization. Recent progress in coupling bacterial GAG-degrading enzymes with sensitive analytical techniques has led to a revolution in understanding the structure-function relationship for an important subset of GAGs, namely heparin/heparan sulfate-like glycosaminoglycans (HSGAGs). The study of chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate (CS/DS), an equally important subset of GAGs, has lagged behind partially due to a lack of enzymatic and analytical tools akin to those developed for HSGAGs. The Flavobacterial heparinases have proven indispensable in characterizing the fine structure of HSGAGs responsible for their different biological functions. As a continuation of ongoing research, a combination of chemical modification, peptide mapping, and site-directed mutagenesis was employed to explore the role of histidine in the activity of heparinase III. Of the thirteen histidines in the enzyme, His295 and His510 were found to be critical for the degradation of heparan sulfate by heparinase III. As a first step to developing the chondroitinases as enzymatic tools for the characterization of CS/DS oligosaccharides, recombinant expression and purification schemes were developed for chondroitinase AC and B from Flactobacterium heparinum.

Both classes of molecules have diverse roles in normal and pathological processes including development, cell growth, wound healing, angiogenesis, viral entry, and cancer. Taking advantage of the ability of carbohydrates to affect biological outcomes, several companies have already begun developing sugar-based structures as therapeutics for malaria and breast cancer, among others. However, the structural complexity that allows HSGAGs and N-glycans to exhibit such a wide array of activities also makes them more difficult to study than their protein and nucleotide counterparts. There are currently no effective methods for rapid synthesis of specific HSGAG or N-glycan structures, and until recently, most common analytical techniques were not useful in this field due to sensitivity constraints. Now, with advances in separation techniques and mass spectrometry, the fundamental roles of biological carbohydrates can be elucidated more efficiently. However, there is still a need for improved methodologies for studying these classes of molecules. This thesis describes the development of a novel technique for the direct isolation and sequencing of protein-binding HSGAG oligosaccharides. As a proof-of-concept, we used heparin and HSGAG-binding proteins of known specificity (fibroblast growth factor and antithrombin III), then utilized the technique to identify an oligosaccharide binder for a protein with unknown HSGAG binding specificity (endostatin). Furthermore, this technique can be readily applied to carbohydrate material from the cell surface. We have ",

    "text": "Development of an analytical method to quantify the oxidative deoxyribose damage product 3'-phosphoglycolaldehyde induced by radiation, iron and peroxynitrite Deoxyribose oxidation in DNA forms strongly electrophilic terminal blocking groups and abasic sites capable of stopping polymerases, forming DNA-protein crosslinks and nucleobase adducts. These threats to the genetic integrity of cells are caused by exogenous and endogenous oxidizing agents and may contribute to diseases such as cancer. To better understand the role of oxidative DNA damage in these diseases, it is necessary to quantify deoxyribose oxidation both in vitro and in vivo. Current methods lack the sensitivity required to measure low concentrations of deoxyribose oxidation products. The goals of the research findings reported here is to develop a sensitive method that can accurately and reproducibly quantify 3'-phosphoglycolaldehyde (PGA), one example of a deoxyribose oxidation product, and to apply the method to quantify PGA in vitro and in cells. Given the presence of reactive carbonyl groups in many deoxyribose oxidation products, the method should be widely applicable to other studies of oxidative ])NA damage. The analytical method exploits the reactive carbonyl moiety in PGA by derivatization as a stable oxime with pentafluorobenzylhydroxylamine, followed by solvent extraction and gas chromatography/negative chemical ionization/mass spectrometry. A stable isotopically-labeled [13C2]-PGA is synthesized and used as an internal standard. The method is linear in response over the range of 30 fmol to 300 pmol and precision is verified by analysis of a synthetic, PGA-containing oligodeoxynucleotide. The limit of detection in the presence of DNA is 30 fmol of PGA. The analytical method was then applied to the quantification of PGA in purified DNA and cultured cells treated with several oxidants.

This work consists of an investigation into two possible methods for determining the role of genes involved in the DNA and cellular damage response, though the methods are generally applicable to investigating a wide variety of biological pathways and responses. A library of approximately 4,800 yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) deletion strains produced by the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project and consisting essentially of all possible mutants having one non-essential gene deleted (and replaced with unique identification tags called \"bar codes\") from the genome are employed in this endeavor. The methods focus on gathering phenotype data in a high-throughput manner and in response to the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). The first method makes use of a new technology called the Living ChipTM, which can hold libraries of compounds or cell cultures in an array of 50-nl channels and which could ideally accommodate all deletion strains on a single array. The second method involves pooling all strains together in a single culture and allowing them to grow competitively to determine their relative fitness based on a specific treatment. ",

These cells come from the pre-implantation embryo, whose native environment is the hypoxic mammalian reproductive tract. Growing stem cells in an environment with higher oxygen levels (i.e. the atmospheric oxygen levels that are normally used to cultivate stem cells) could be bad for the cells, as oxygen is toxic due to its powerful oxidative capacity. In this experiment, J1 murine embryonic stem cells were grown at 0%, 2%, 5%, 10%, and 20% oxygen by volume to assess the effects that lower oxygen levels have on stem cell growth, plating efficiency, and metabolism. Two reaction vessels were built so that the cells could be grown in a controlled environment. Premixed gas cylinders were used to flush the vessels and an optical probe was used to measure the headspace oxygen concentration. Cells were found to grow faster than atmospheric conditions when in a moderately hypoxic environment where the oxygen concentration was between 2% and 10%, and considerably slower than atmospheric conditions as the headspace oxygen concentration approached zero. Maximum cell density decreased, glucose-lactate yield increased, glucose-cell yield decreased, and glutamine-cell yield decreased as headspace oxygen decreased. There were no strong correlations between oxygen concentration and glutamine-ammonia yield or plating efficiency. From the results of this study, it appears that it may be preferable to grow murine embryonic stem cells in a moderately hypoxic environment around 10% oxygen to increase the growth rate while minimizing the maximum cell density and metabolic inefficiency compromises.

In this research, an ES cell line with transfected green fluorescent protein (GFP) co-expressed by an Oct-4 promoter was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) to obtain such profile. As Oct-4 is an ES cell differentiation marker whose expression varies with pluripotency, GFP expression could simply be measured in these cells to determine how pluripotent they are as a population. The differentiation characterization of ES cells was also conducted with different culture conditions of reduced serum and glucose concentrations both in the presence and absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) which prevents spontaneous differentiation, as well as at varied LIF concentrations and seeding densities. In addition, fundamental growth kinetic and metabolic profiles were obtained to get a more complete picture of how ES cells behave under these varied culturing conditions. The doubling time (t[sub]d) of R1 Oct4-GFP cell line was found to be 13 hours in LIF⁺ culture and 8 hours in culture with LIF addition after 7 days of LIF withdrawal, implying that cell proliferation rate is higher for cells receiving a sudden upregulation of genes controlling cell division through LIF addition. Although the upregulation of the genes is rapid, the downregulation of these genes through LIF withdrawal was found to take 6-7 days, while 3-4 days were required to downregulate the pou5f gene (which controls Oct4 expression).

The point stiffness of the TM increased with frequency when radial forces were applied but showed no trend with frequency for longitudinal forces.

Moderate increases ([approximately]30%) in nucleobase deamination products were observed in the SJL mice bearing the RcsX tumor, but the biological meaning of these increases awaits studies of DNA repair kinetics. dO was not detected in any study at levels above 5 per 10⁸ nt, leading to the prediction that it will not be present at significant levels in inflamed tissues in humans. As a complement to the LC-MS method for the quantification of nucleobase deamination products, enzymatic probes were also developed for oxidative and nitrosative DNA lesions. These probes would not only allow differential quantification of the two types of DNA damage, but would also allow the lesions to be mapped in any DNA sequence by coupling their activity with the technique of ligation-mediated PCR. As an extension of the biomarker study, the effects of ONOO⁻ dose and dose-rate on the DNA damage and mutations induced in the supF gene were investigated. The observations suggest that both the dose and dose-rate at which a genetic target is exposed to ONOO⁻ substantially influence the damage and mutational response and these parameters will need to be considered in assessing the potential effects of ONOO⁻ in vivo. Finally, an extended study using the analytical method developed in this thesis yielded results in E. coli consistent with a new paradigm: perturbations of nucleobase metabolism may lead to incorporation of the purine precursors hypoxanthine (I) and xanthine (X) into DNA.

However, numerous studies have revealed important differences between TIMP family members in their ability to inhibit angiogenic processes in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo despite their universal ability to inhibit matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity. To address these differences, structure-function studies were conducted to identify and characterize the anti-angiogenic domains of TIMP-2, the endogenous MMP inhibitor that uniquely inhibits capillary endothelial cell (EC) proliferation and angiogenesis in vivo. Only the carboxy-terminal domain of TIMP-2 (T2C) and not the MMP-inhibitory N-terminal domain (T2N), inhibited capillary EC proliferation. Although both T2N and T2C inhibited embryonic angiogenesis, only T2C potently inhibited mitogen-stimulated angiogenesis. These findings demonstrate that TIMP-2 possesses two distinct types of anti-angiogenic activities which can be uncoupled from each other. The anti-proliferative activity of T2C was further mapped to the 24-amino acid peptide, Loop 6, which proved to be a potent inhibitor of both embryonic and nitogen-stimulated angiogenesis in vivo. Initial studies into the mechanism(s) by which Loop 6 inhibits angiogenesis revealed that the anti-proliferative effects of Loop 6 are due, at least in part, to the inhibition of cell cycle progression and not to the induction of apoptosis. This inhibition was associated with increased levels of cell cycle inhibitor p27. Although Loop 6 did not compete with bFGF for binding to its receptor, ",

Biocompatible scaffolds assist in providing a template for cell distribution and extracellular matrix accumulation in a three-dimensional geometry. In these studies, a self-assembling peptide hydrogel is evaluated as a potential scaffold for cartilage repair using a model bovine cell source. A seeding technique is developed for 3-D encapsulation of chondrocytes in a peptide hydrogel. The chondrocyte-seeded peptide hydrogel was then evaluated cellular activities in vitro under standard culture conditions and also when subjected to dynamic compression. During 4 weeks of culture in vitro, chondrocytes seeded within the peptide hydrogel retained their morphology and developed a cartilage-like ECM rich in proteoglycans and type II collagen, indicative of a stable chondrocyte phenotype. Time dependent accumulation of this ECM was paralleled by increases in material stiffness, indicative of deposition of mechanically-functional neo-tissue. Culture of chondrocyte-seeded peptide hydrogels in ITS-supplemented medium was investigated as an alternative to high serum culture. Low serum (0.2%), ITS-supplemented medium was found to maintain high levels of cell division and extracellular matrix synthesis and accumulation, as seen in high serum culture. Furthermore, low serum, ITS medium induced minimal chondrocyte de-differentiation on the surface of the hydrogel. This is in contrast to high serum culture, where surface de-differentiation and subsequent proliferation led to a 5-10 cell thick layer that stained positive for type I collagen. ",

Given that such genetic changes may promote tumorigenesis, it is critical to identify those genetic and environmental factors that render cells susceptible to homologous recombination. Our goal is to elucidate the mechanisms of DNA damage-induced recombination and to determine the role of DNA repair enzymes in modulating homologous recombination in eukaryotic cells. Alkylating agents are abundant in our environment and are generated endogenously as normal metabolites. In addition to their mutagenic and cytotoxic effects, alkylating agents stimulate homologous recombination in eukaryotic cells. Removal of alkylated bases by DNA glycosylases, such as the Magl 3-methyladenine (3MeA) DNA glycosylase, initiates the base excision repair (BER) pathway. To investigate the molecular basis for methylation-induced homologous recombination in S. cerevisiae, intrachromosomal recombination was measured under conditions where MAGI expression levels were varied. Cells lacking Magl show increased susceptibility to methylation-induced recombination, suggesting that unrepaired 3MeA lesions induce recombination. Overexpression of M4GI also elevates recombination levels, presumably due to the accumulation of recombinogenic BER intermediates. ",

It is now becoming increasingly evident that sequence specific GAG-protein interactions play critical roles in cell growth, development, angiogenesis, cancer, anticoagulation and microbial pathogenesis. Therefore it is important to understand the specificity of glycan-protein interactions and how these specific interactions influence their structure-function relationships. This thesis addresses many challenges in this emerging area of glycomics, by taking an integrated approach that couples biophysical and biochemical methods with a bioinformatics framework to represent and process sequence information content in GAGs. With this motivation the thesis is divided into 4 components 1. Using heparin/heparan sulfate GAGs (HSGAGs) - fibroblast growth factor (FGF) as a model GAG-protein system, the first part focuses on determining the structural basis of FGF oligomerization, sequence specific FGF-HSGAG interactions and FGF-receptor (FGFR) interactions which collectively influence the specificity of HSGAG mediated FGF signaling. 2. The second part focuses on developing enzymatic tools for analysis of GAGs using chondroitinase B, HSGAG 2-0 sulfatase and 3-0 sulfotransferase as model enzymes. For each of these enzymes a theoretical model for the enzyme-substrate structural complex is developed and it is coupled with the site directed mutagenesis and biochemical studies to determine its catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity. 3. To deal with the heterogeneity and high information density of GAG sequences, an informatics based approach to decode GAG sequence information has been developed. ",

Due to a lack of effective tools to study structure-function relationship of these complex molecules, the role(s) of HLGAGs in cancer remains largely indirect and poorly understood. To study the role(s) of HLGAGs in cancer growth, metastasis and angiogenesis, tumor systems were studied using heparinases I and III which have distinct substrate specificities. Studies, focusing on the biochemistry of the heparinase active site, elucidated key interactions important for enzymatic activities, thus enabling the biological studies presented here. In vitro cell culture study with heparinases as tools clearly showed that cell surface HLGAGs are involved in regulating fundamental cellular activities including cell proliferation, invasion and adhesion. Significantly, heparinase I and III demonstrated distinct effect on these cellular activities with heparinase III inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, invasion and adhesion in selected model systems and heparinase I inhibiting these processes. Further in vivo studies in animal tumor models confirmed and expanded the distinct responses to heparinase I and III treatment. HLGAG fragments generated from heparinase treatment were found to be responsible for the effect of heparinase treatment in tumor models. Moreover, cell surface HLGAGs containing cryptic activatory and inhibitory sequence information were identified and characterized. In contrast to heparinase I- generated HLGAG fragments, heparinase III- generated HLGAG fragments were shown here to inhibit both primary tumor growth and secondary lung metastasis. ",

In this Thesis, we investigate affinity maturation of antibodies for very high affinity binding. Two single chain antigen-binding fragment (scFv) antibody systems that were engineered to obtain higher affinity interactions through directed evolution were probed using biophysical techniques to illuminate affinity modulation in proteins. First, anti-c-erbB-2 antibodies and their binding partner, the extracellular domain of the glycoprotein tumor antigen c-erbB-2, were examined. Thermodynamic studies were carried out on the originally identified human scFv and three higher affinity mutants.

The multistep model of cancer proposes that cancer is a genetic disease in which mutations are required in carcinogenesis. When this theory was championed, research focused on somatic mutations. The focus has broadened to include epigenetic mechanisms in changing gene expression. The association between chronic infection, chronic inflammation and increased cancer risk has been supported by epidemiologic studies. Data link chronic inflammation associated with infectious disease to increased cancer risk. Some examples of such infectious agents include hepatitis B virus, Schistosoma haemotobium, and Helicobacter pylori.

These engineering tools are also useful for many biological applications ranging from drug delivery to DNA sequencing, since they can be used to fabricate small features at a low cost and in a reproducible manner. The goal of this thesis was to develop techniques based on the merger of novel materials and nano and microfabrication approaches to manipulate cell microenvironment in culture. To control cell migration and to restrict cell or colony size, cells and proteins were patterned by using molding or printing methods. Poly(ethylene glycol)-based molecules and polysaccharides were used to control cell-substrate interactions and to prevent cell adhesion on specific regions of a substrate. To control cell-cell contact, layer-by-layer deposition of ionic biopolymers (i.e. negatively charged hyaluronic acid and positively charged poly-L-lysine) was used to generate patterned co-cultures. In addition, to control cell-soluble factor interactions, microfluidic-based approaches were developed. To pattern cells and proteins within microchannels, a soft lithographic method was developed to pattern microchannel substrates using printing and molding approaches. ",

    "text": "Quantitative analysis of the cytokine-mediated apoptosis-survival cell decision process How do cells sense their environment and decide whether to live or to die? This question has drawn considerable interest since 1972, when it was first discovered that cells have an intrinsic ability to self-destruct through a process called apoptosis. Since then, apoptosis has been shown to play a critical role in both normal physiology and disease. In addition, many of the basic molecular mechanisms that control apoptosis have been revealed. Yet despite the known list of interactions and regulators, it remains difficult to inspect the network of apoptosis-related proteins and predict how cells will behave. The challenge is even greater when one considers interactions with other networks that are anti-apoptotic, such as growth-factor networks. In this thesis, we develop an approach to measure, analyze, and predict how complex intracellular signaling networks transduce extracellular stimuli into cellular fates. This approach entails three interrelated aims: 1) to develop high-throughput, quantitative techniques that measure key nodes in the intracellular network; 2) to characterize the quantitative changes in network state and cell behavior by exposing cells to diverse fate-changing stimuli; and 3) to use data-driven modeling approaches that analyze large signaling-response datasets to suggest new biological hypotheses.

The basic premise of the thesis is that integrin-specific adhesion peptides, when presented in a biophysically appropriate spatial arrangement against an inert background, allow enrichment of CTPs in vitro. Comb copolymer comprising a methyl methacrylate backbone with 10-mer poly(oxyethylene) sidechains was selected as the vehicle to present small adhesion peptides at the surface. This polymer shows excellent performance in cell resistance studies and offers sufficient functionalizable sites to create high local densities of ligands. Methods for preparing comb copolymer substrates with peptides in [approx.] 300 nm² clusters with inter-ligand spacings closer than integrins were developed. This nanometer-scale clustered presentation was favorable to integrin binding. Cells were more spread on RGD peptide substrates with a higher degree of nanoscale clustering but of the same overall peptide surface density as comparable substrates with lower degree of peptide clustering. We evaluated adhesion peptides for their ability to support CFU formation of marrow-derived CTPs using colony forming unit (CFU) assay. ",

Alterations in the biosynthesis of this molecule over time could impact the ability of the tissue to perform its necessary functions. Several factors have been shown to alter the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate in cartilage; among them are age, disease, depth of tissue, and mechanical compression. Specifically, mechanical compression has been shown to have a significant effect on the sulfation pattern and chain length and number in cartilage explant studies. The mechanisms that govern these alterations, however, have not been determined. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of mechanical compression on chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis and analyze the roles of two possible mechanisms; enzyme transcription and organelle deformation. The effects of mechanical compression on the transcription rates of enzymes associated with the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate have not been previously studied. To perform this study in a bovine model, portions of the bovine genome had to be sequenced, PCR primers designed, and bulk expression levels determined. Static compression resulted in the significant up-regulation of two genes of interest: chondroitin sulfate and GalNAc 4S,6-sulfotransferase. ",

This experimental design involved running shake flask culture at 15 different experimental conditions with duplicates. Optical density (OD600), dry cell weight (DCW), and BCA Protein Assays were done on each experiment. Mathematical models in terms of these parameters' effects and their interactions were proposed for each of the responses. The significance of each effect and interaction, as well as the goodness-of-fit of mathematical models to data were examined by analysis of variance. It was found that biomass (with R²Adj=0.951) is a strong function of glycerol concentration (higher glycerol concentration leads to higher biomass), but it varies much less with agitation, and it is completely independent of salt concentration. Growth rate (R²Adj=0.901), however, varies strongly with agitation and salt concentration, but much more weakly with glycerol concentration. Protein production has a low R²Adj value of 0.746, implying that higher-order terms, e.g. x₁² and x₂², should be tested for significance in the model. ",

We aimed to test this hypothesis and to determine its validity across cancer cell types. In addition, we hoped to explain the involvement of certain kinases in nitric oxide-induced apoptosis. The experimental setup involved stimulating human colorectal cancer cells, HT-29 and HCT- 116, and human prostate cancer cells, LNCaP, with cytokines in order to induce cell death. Then, we observed the effects of NO inhibitors, kinase inhibitors, and activation of Akt, a kinase up-stream of the caspase cascade, following transfection of a DNA sequence that was proven to protect cells against apoptosis induction. In our series of experiments, inhibition of the nitric oxide synthases removes nitric oxide protection from apoptosis, but inhibition of only the inducible synthase has opposite effects with prostate and colon cancer cells that are considered insignificant, and its effects on the two types of colon cancer cells are in discord. Transformation and transfection of ARK5 into the colorectal cancer cell line, HT-29 did not prove beneficial. Similarly, glucosamine showed no clear pattern of reducing apoptosis in the cells. Therefore, we propose further exploration of the inhibition of constitutive nitric oxide synthases as a potential therapy. ",

However, these applications are limited because of the difficulty in isolating and expanding pure populations of adult stem cells (ASCs). A major barrier to ASC expansion in vitro is their property of asymmetric cell kinetics. Our lab has developed a method, Suppression of Asymmetric Cell Kinetics (SACK), to expand ASCs in vitro by shifting their cell kinetics program from asymmetric to symmetric. We have found that guanine nucleotide precursors can be used to convert the kinetics of adult stem cells from asymmetric to symmetric, which promotes their exponential expansion. Previously, we have used the SACK method to derive hepatic and cholangiocyte stem cell strains from adult rat livers in vitro. These cell strains provide an assay to evaluate whether growth factors and cytokines previously implicated in proliferation of progenitor cells act by converting the kinetics of the stem cells in the population from asymmetric to symmetric, and thus identify new SACK agents. We are evaluating three agents, Wnt, IGF- 1, and Sonic hedgehog (Shh). ",

The intrinsic sequence variety stemming from the large number of building blocks that compose this biopolymer leads to substantial information density as well as to the ability to regulate a wide variety of important biological processes. With the recent and progressive emergence of biochemical and analytical tools to probe GAG structure and function, efforts can be taken to understand the role of GAGs in cell biology and in disease in the various physiological locations where GAGs can exist. As a first step to probe the functions of GAGs, the heparin/heparan sulfate-GAG (HSGAG)-fibroblast growth factor (FGF) system was examined. Understanding the role of HSGAGs in inducing FGF2 dimerization led to the development of a novel engineered protein that was found to be effective at promoting functional recovery in stroke. Subsequently, methods to isolate HSGAGs from the cell surface were optimized and the ability of HSGAGs to support FGF signaling was investigated. Cell surface HSGAGs can define the responsiveness of a given cell to FGF1 and FGF2 through multiple receptor isoforms. Stromal cell derived HSGAGs were also identified as critical regulators of tumor cell growth and metastasis, effecting not only FGF2., but also 1-integrin signaling. ",

Hepatocyte adhesion environments were examined in two settings: spheroid culture prior to seeding in the bioreactor and 2D surface culture methods that could be applied to the bioreactor scaffold. Spheroids were formed either by culturing in spinning suspension or on a static, non-adherent surface. In spheroid culture, the addition of extracellular matrix (ECM) signaling through the use of soluble Matrigel or adhesion protein-coated microspheres did not improve hepatocyte viability or function as assessed by liver-specific gene expression. These results suggest the importance of cell-cell rather than cell-surface interactions in maintaining hepatocytes. Optimal culturing of spheroids in spinning suspension without the ECM addition was found to be 3 days without media changes. 2D surfaces were treated with an adhesion peptide-conjugated comb polymer, preventing nonspecific cell adhesion and allowing attachment through the [alpha]₅[beta]₁ integrin.

Colorectal cancer is a very serious complication of IBD, and a patient's risk increases with increasing extent and duration of disease.2 There is no cure for CD, and the only cure for UC is removal of the entire colon and rectum.

Anti-angiogenics alone have not proven effective in inducing tumor regression in the clinic due to both the cytostatic nature of anti-angiogenic therapy and the potential formation of new regions of hypoxia within the tumor after therapy. The new therapeutic paradigm is for combining both anti-angiogenics and traditional cytotoxic agents for a synergistic effect. The efficacy of cytotoxic agents may be reduced after anti-angiogenic therapy, however, due to limited access to tumor vasculature and hypoxia-induced drug resistance. We propose that loading cytotoxic agents within the tumor prior to blood vessel collapse will enable both greater drug accumulation within the tumor as well as a reduction in the formation of therapy-induced regions of hypoxia. We present here a novel nanodelivery vehicle termed a 'nanocell' for the spatio-temporal recruitment of both anti-angiogenics and cytotoxic agents within the solid tumor to achieve this goal. Nanocells consist of a polymeric nanocore encapsulating the cytostatic agent doxorubicin surrounded by a lipid vesicle containing the anti-angiogenic agent combretastatin A4. ",

With the appropriate chemistry, such a bead can be attached to a single molecule as a handle, permitting the application of force on the single molecule. Measuring the force applied in real-time is dependent on detecting the bead's displacement from the trapping laser beam axis.

This technique can detect the arrival of a single molecule into a small volume of space or detect the conformational changes of a single molecule. Combining optical tweezers with single-molecule fluorescence so that one can apply forces on a single molecule while monitoring its effects via single molecule fluorescence provides an even more powerful experimental platform to perform such microscopic studies.

We used an Affymetrix-based oligonucleotide microarray platform on the premise that a specific genetic expression signature at isolated time points would be indicative of disease status. Model based expression index comparisons generated by dChip yielded consistent profiles of differential gene expression for H. hepaticus infected male mice with progressive liver disease versus uninfected control mice within each age group.

In particular, the finding of small amounts of chemical mutagens in cigarette smoke has led to the general hypothesis that mutagens in cigarette smoke induce oncomutations and thus account for the carcinogenic effect of cigarette smoking in human lungs. However, this hypothesis has not been tested by an assay of nuclear point mutations in lungs of smokers and nonsmokers. Mismatch amplification mutation assay (MAMA), an effective form of allele-specific PCR, was applied for detection of point mutations in TP53 bp742, bp746 and bp747, K-ras bp35 and HPRT bp508 from a total of 291 tracheal-bronchial epithelial sectors from six smokers and nine non-smokers, yielding 949 individual mutational assays. The conditions of MAMA for each target point mutations were optimized such that the sensitivity of each was equal to or below 10⁻⁵.

By sustaining MEK-ERK signaling, tEGF increases the contact of CTP with an otherwise moderately adhesive synthetic polymer and confers resistance to apoptosis induced by the proinflammatory cytokine, FasL.

    "text": "Investigating the role of calcium in the biomechanical response of neutrophils to mechanical deformation experienced in the pulmonary capillaries Neutrophils in the pulmonary microcirculation are subjected to mechanical deformation while traveling through capillaries of sizes much smaller than the mean neutrophil diameter. This deformation has been shown to result in significant reductions in both the shear storage and shear loss moduli of the cell, with subsequent recovery towards their initial values. Also, deformation above a threshold stimulus results in neutrophil activation, evidenced by pseudopod projection from the cell. These two events are thought to occur via independent pathways, yet little is known about the mechanosensing signaling involved. Other work has demonstrated that physiological deformation of neutrophils induces a marked increase in the levels of cytosolic calcium, suggesting that this occurrence may trigger the biomechanical response observed in the cell. The aim of this thesis was to elucidate the role of calcium in the neutrophil response to the mechanical deformation experienced during transit through the pulmonary capillaries. ",

    "text": "Towards a microfluidic disease detection deviced based on cellular adhesion differences There is a great need in the fields of biology, medicine, and pharmaceuticals to create high-throughput devices for the detection of specific cell states in a heterogeneous mixture of cells. The desire is to differentiate among diseased and healthy cells, cell age, and cell type with the minimum amount of sample pretreatment. This project addresses this need by developing microfluidic devices that exploit the adhesion differences between cell states and cell types to rapidly count cells of different types without the need for labels. There are two avenues in which to explore cell adhesion differences with these devices, the first is a net electrostatic change at the surface of the cell wall and the second is the presence of specific cell-membrane adhesion proteins. It is hypothesized that the forced interaction of the cell wall with the microfabricated microcapillary walls would result in a differential velocity based on cell type that could be detected simply using a microscope and video camera or an interferometer. The eventual integration of cell velocity detection would result in a portable all-inclusive lab-on-a-chip system that could be used in the field for detecting the presence of diseases, such as malaria and cancer as well as in a lab setting for drug discovery.

However, the design principles governing the construction and operation of these networks remain mostly unknown. To discover design principles in these networks, we investigated and developed a set of computational tools described below. First, we looked into the application of optimization techniques to explore network topology, parameterization, or both, and to evaluate relative fitness of networks operational strategies. In particular, we studied the ability of an enzymatic cycle to produce dynamic properties such as responsiveness and transient noise filtering. We discovered that non-linearity of the enzymatic cycle allows more effective filtering of transient noise. Furthermore, we found that networks with multiple activation steps, despite being less responsive, are better in filtering transient noise. Second, we explored a method to construct compact models of signal transduction networks based on a protein-domain network representation. This method generates models whose number of species, in the worst case, scales quadratically to the number of protein-domain sites and modification states, a tremendous saving over the combinatorial scaling in the more standard mass-action model was estimated to consist of more that 10⁷ species and was too large to simulate; however, a simplified model consists of only 132 state variables and produced intuitive behavior. The resulting models were utilized to study the roles of a scaffold protein and of a shared binding domain to pathway functions. ",

Using RNA interference or peptide inhibitors to downregulate specific connexins we examined the role of gap junctions in intercellular diffusion, calcium excitation, and in mediating the expression of vascular regulators transforming growth factor-[Beta][ (TGF-[beta]), prostacyclin, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). siRNA inhibition of connexin 43 in porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAEC) significantly decreased the diffusion distance of Lucifer yellow dye and cytoplasmic calcium levels after mechanical wounding. Wound healing experiments suggested that stimulatory signals travel through gap junctions containing connexin 43, while inhibitory signal travel through gap junctions containing connexin 37. Connexin 43 and connexin 37 inhibition, alone or in combination, reduced the levels of secreted latent TGF-[beta] in confluent PAEC monolayers after 24 hours of incubation.

Fibrous structures with directionally ordered phage were obtained by interaction with cobalt ions.

Creating a more productive expression host for the manufacture of these proteins is a potential solution. Although heterologous proteins are frequently made in organisms as disparate as E. coli and bovines, the single-celled organism S. cerevisiae has emerged as a well-qualified candidate due to its approachable genetic and fermentation attributes as well as its ability to stably fold disulfide bonded and multi domain proteins. Because S. cerevisiae screens for enhanced protein secretion have traditionally utilized low-throughput and often plate-based methods, a high-throughput, liquid phase assay could offer a real advantage in secretory selection. In this thesis, yeast surface display is investigated as a potential proxy for heterologous protein secretion. Although ultimately unsuitable as a screening proxy, the surface display experiments did show a novel method of improving protein secretion by co-expressing a more stably folded protein with the protein of interest.

To date, no robust, efficient method for the pure, ex vivo expansion of human HSCs has been demonstrated. Previous methods primarily induced the expansion of committed hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), yielding even less pure populations of HSCs. This research was based on the hypothesis that, like for other adult stem cells (ASCs), the major barrier to expanding HSCs ex vivo is in preferentially regulating the asymmetric self-renewal of HSCs without loss in their ability to produce differentiated committed HPCs. This laboratory has shown that a p53-dependent pathway specifically controls the self-renewal pattern of several types of ASCs and thereby provides an effective means for expansion of ASCs in culture. The method, which involves the use of purine metabolites to achieve suppression of asymmetric cell kinetics, is referred to as SACK. The utility of the p53-dependent pathway was investigated for directing expansion of human HSCs. In order to support this investigation, the proliferation of HPCs in in vitro cultures was repressed by culturing cells without hematopoietic growth factors and cytokines. ",

Research currently involves mass screenings of different combinations of vector components without a true understanding of how each component interacts with the target cell. Few tools are currently available for scientists to quantitatively examine these vector-to-cell interactions or determine the rate limiting steps within the gene delivery pathway. Thus, researchers cannot fully optimize the vector design to reach maximal delivery efficiency. This project seeks to address this issue by modifying a density gradient electrophoresis (DGE) device originally developed on Mel Juso cells to segregate primary rat hepatocyte lysate into nuclear, early endosomal, late endosomal/lysosomal, and cytoplasmic fractions. We found that according to the Horseradish Peroxidase assay, late endosomes and lysosomes consistently localize to fractions 11-13 and early endosomes in fractions 18 to 21. There was minimal labeling in fractions 14 through 17 demonstrating that separation of the organelles was achieved.

Recombinant protein subunits and peptides are relatively safe alternatives to live attenuated pathogens. However, these antigens are poorly immunogenic when administered alone in solution form and thus require the use of an adjuvant. To this end, we have developed a hydrogel-based nanoparticulate system to encapsulate protein antigen and to co-deliver it with DNA/RNA-based adjuvants to dendritic cells, the key antigen presenting cells in primary immune responses.

Studies with IGF-1: Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1) is a potent anabolic factor capable of endocrine and paracrine/autocrine signaling. Previous studies have demonstrated that mechanical compression can regulate the action of IGF-1 on chondrocyte biosynthesis in intact tissue; when applied simultaneously, these stimuli act by distinct cell activation pathways. Our objectives were to elucidate the extent and kinetics of the chondrocyte transcriptional response to combined IGF-1 and static compression in cartilage explants. Discussion: Clustering analysis revealed five distinct groups. TIMP-3 and ADAMTS-5, MMP-l and IGF-2, and IGF-1 and Collagen II, were all robustly co-expressed under all conditions tested.

Deep ultraviolet microscopy received attention in the 1950s as a way to generate image contrast from the strong absorbance of proteins and nucleic acids at wavelengths shorter than 300 nm. However, the lethal effects of these wavelengths limited their usefulness in studies of cell function, separating the contributions of protein and nucleic acid proved difficult, and scattering artifacts were a significant concern. We have used short exposures of deep-ultraviolet light synchronized with an ultraviolet-sensitive camera to observe mitosis and motility in living cells without causing necrosis, and quantified absorbance at 280 nm and 260 nm together with tryptophan native fluorescence in order to calculate maps of nucleic acid mass, protein mass, and quantum yield in unlabeled cells. We have also developed a method using images acquired at 320nm and 340nm, and an equation for Mie scattering, to determine a scattering correction factor for each pixel at 260nm and 280nm. These developments overcome the three main obstacles to previous deep UV microscopy efforts, creating a new approach to imaging unlabeled living cells that acquires quantitative information about protein and nucleic acid as a function of position and time.

Mapping the influence connections among biomolecules in a signaling cascade aids in understanding of the underlying biological process and in development of therapeutics for diseases involving aberrant pathways, such as cancer and autoimmune disease. In this thesis, we present an approach for automatically reverse-engineering the structure of a signaling pathway, from high-throughput data. We apply Bayesian network structure inference to signaling protein measurements performed in thousands of single cells, using a machine called a flow cytorneter. Our de novo reconstruction of a T-cell signaling map was highly accurate, closely reproducing the known pathway structure, and accurately predicted novel pathway connections.

The results provided extend the validity of transport models to include transport in the absence of mass transfer boundary layer.

First, electrostatic analysis of a series of small molecule neuraminidase inhibitors was used to demonstrate that charge optimization improves the electrostatic component of the binding free energy, despite changes in binding mode and discrete chemical constraints. Additionally, chemical changes suggested by charge optimization frequently corresponded to tighter-binding inhibitors, indicating that this technique would be useful for the design of future inhibitors. Second, computational sequence and structure analysis were used to study the PDZ3-CRIPT binding interaction and a method for sequence analysis was developed to locate residues important for binding specificity. Third, computational analysis of the horseradish peroxidase active site suggested five positions as candidates for mutation, and further studies of new mutant enzymes let to ideas for the improvement of computational enzyme design procedures. Finally, both computational protein design techniques and a model of the evolutionary process were used to study the efficiency of evolution as a tool for creating new proteins in the laboratory.

While the structural and physiological consequences of negative supercoiling have been well studied, technical challenges have prevented extensive examination of positively supercoiled DNA. Studies suggest that at sufficiently high levels of overwinding, DNA relieves strain by adopting an elongated structure, where the bases are positioned extrahelically and the backbones occupy the center of the helix.

To examine the structural changes resulting from physiological levels of positive DNA supercoiling, I have developed a method for preparing highly purified positively supercoiled plasmid substrates. Based on a method previously developed in this laboratory, this allows for preparation of large quantities of very pure, highly positively supercoiled plasmid. It also expands on earlier methods by exploiting ionic strength to modulate the direction of supercoiling introduced, allowing preparation of either positively or negatively supercoiled substrates.

To study homologous recombination in vivo, we used Fluorescent Yellow Direct Repeat (FYDR) mice in which a homologous recombination event at a transgene yields a fluorescent cell. To study homologous recombination using FYDR mice, we developed one- and two-photon in situ imaging techniques that reveal both the frequency and the sizes of isolated recombinant cell clusters within intact pancreatic tissue. We then applied these tools to analyze the effects of cancer risk factors such as exposure, genetic predisposition and age on homologous recombination in vivo. To determine the effect of exposure to exogenous carcinogens on homologous recombination, FYDR mice were treated with two different chemotherapeutic agents, cisplatin and mitomycin-C. ",

A tissue-engineered liver for transplantation will require complex structures to support cell differentiation and integration with surrounding vasculature. Recent developments in 3D-printing (3DP™) technology allow the construction of such geometrically complex scaffolds out of biodegradable polymers. These artificial tissues should maintain healthy, functional hepatocytes in proper contact with supporting cell types in the context of proper flow cues. This project comprises three major efforts. First, the design and development of a 3D-printed scaffold, constructed of a porous biodegradable polymer matrix, for flow bioreactor culture. Second, the development of protocols for the production, preparation, and flow support of these scaffolds. And third, the employment of standard cell culture methodologies to test the ability of these scaffolds to support liver tissue cultures. Initial cell culture experiments showed similar rates of albumin production in the polymer disk scaffolds compared to cells in silicon-chip scaffolds under appropriately scaled flow conditions, indicating that the polymer scaffolds maintain functioning liver tissue. Further, histology sections of liver tissue grown on these polymer scaffolds show organization of cells into structures reminiscent of in vivo liver. The results of this study show that 3D-printed porous polymer scaffolds have great potential for use as biodegradable tissue culture support devices. It is believed that, combined with printing technologies now under development, the technologies developed in this thesis will help facilitate the construction of an implantable tissue engineered liver.

As such, these information-dense molecules are key regulators of extracellular signals. However, to date, there has been a lack of effective biochemical and analytical tools for the analysis of glycosaminoglycan structure and hence, there is very little understanding of exactly how glycosaminoglycan structure impinges on function. Development of such tools is especially important for a key subset of glycosaminoglycans, i.e., heparin/heparan sulfate-like glycosaminoglycans (HLGAGs). As a first step in the development of tools to study HLGAG structure, biochemical studies were completed on the heparinases, a family of three HLGAG-degrading enzymes from Flavobacterium heparinum. With heparinase I, it was found that calcium is a necessary cofactor for optimal activity and that two putative calcium coordinating motifs exist in heparinase I. With heparinase II, a single cysteine and three histidines were found to be critical for proper enzymatic function. Finally, with heparinase III, two histidines were found to be catalytically important. ",

Current research has focused on developing such vehicles using end gene expression as the benchmark. While transgene protein production is the overall objective of successful gene delivery, such qualitative treatment of gene delivery, especially for non-viral vectors, may result in unoptimized vectors and potential rate limiting steps unidentified. Quantitative analysis of the gene delivery pathway is essential for the characterization, comparison, and design of vectors. The complex nature of the mechanisms for gene delivery, particularly at the cellular level, contains multiple potentially rate limiting steps to successful gene expression. Through quantitative methodologies, vector efficacy can be related to molecular characteristics and specific processes within the gene delivery pathway. These potentially rate limiting steps include, but are not limited to, cell surface association, subcellular trafficking, endosomal escape, nuclear translocation, vector unpackaging, and gene expression. Design of synthetic gene delivery vectors seeks to develop molecular systems mimicking virus-like infection behavior, including cell membrane attachment and rapid internalization followed by endosomal escape, nuclear localization, and finally gene expression. To explore such opportunities for vector optimization and design, a model human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line by sets of transfection agents complexed with a plasmid. Time courses of plasmid numbers were determined both from whole cells and from isolated nuclei by real-time quantitative PCR. ",

Current understanding of tissue differentiation mechanisms is based on studies of protein and RNAs that asymmetrically segregate between daughter cells during embryogenesis. Whether or not other types of biomolecules segregate asymmetrically has not been widely studied. In 1975, John Cairns proposed that ASCs preferentially segregate the oldest parental template DNA strands to themselves and pass on newly replicated DNA strands to their differentiating progeny in order to protect the stem cell from inheriting DNA replication mutations. This laboratory has shown non-random chromosome segregation in murine fetal fibroblasts that model asymmetric self-renewal like ASCs. In these cells, chromosomes that contain the oldest DNA strands co-segregate to the cycling daughter stem-like cells, while chromosomes with more recently replicated DNA segregate to the non-stem cell daughters. Previously, cytological methods were reported to elucidate non-random segregation in these cells. This dissertation research provides additional confirmation of the mechanism using physicochemical methods. Specifically, buoyant density-shift experiments in equilibrium CsCl density gradients were used to detect co-segregated \"immortal DNA strands\" based on incorporation of the thymidine base analogue bromodeoxyuridine. In addition, DNA from cells undergoing non-random mitotic chromosome segregation was analyzed for unique DNA base modifications and global structural modifications (by HPLC and melting temperature analyses). To date, these studies show no significant differences compared to control randomly segregated DNA. Components of the mitotic chromosome separation ",

Intracellular mechanosensors are thought to be activated by conformational changes induced by local cellular deformations. Since these mechanosensors have been speculated to be located in several cellular domains including the cell membrane, the cytoskeleton, and the nucleus, it is necessary to achieve a detailed understanding of subcellular mechanics. In this work, we present novel methods to independently quantify cytoskeletal displacements, mechanical coupling between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix, and nuclear mechanics based on high resolution tracking of cellular structures and receptor bound magnetic beads in response to applied strain or microscopic forces. These methods were applied to study the effects of several human disease associated mutations on subcellular mechanics and to examine the interaction between known protein function and specific changes in cellular mechanical properties and mechanotransduction pathways. Initial experiments were targeted to the role of membrane adhesion receptors. Experiments with cells expressing a mutant form of the integrin-associated molecule tetraspanin CD151 revealed that CD151 plays a key role in selectively strengthening α6βl integrin-mediated adhesion to laminin-1.

Studying hepatotoxicity in vitro is a challenging task because hepatocytes, the metabolically active cells of the liver, are very difficult to maintain in culture. After just 24 hours, the cells detach from the plate and die, and even if they survive they usually do not express the metabolic functions which they have in vivo. It has been observed by others that culturing hepatocytes between two layers of collagen type I maintains in vivo-like morphology and also many drug metabolizing enzymes for weeks. In spite of the research examining drug metabolism in collagen sandwiches, there are very few studies evaluating this system for investigating hepatotoxicity. We cultured primary rat hepatocytes in the collagen sandwich configuration and our goal was to optimize this system for long-term studies and to examine toxicity of a variety of hepatotoxins. By measuring secretions of urea and albumin, and P4501A activity, we determined the optimal cell density to be 50,000 cells/cm2. We also evaluated the need for epidermal growth factor (EGF) in our cultures, by comparing urea and albumin secretions in cultures grown with and without EGF. The cultures without EGF had significantly less secretion of both urea and albumin just two days after plating. Therefore, we decided to include EGF in the medium.

The highly orchestrated events that take place in the liver to maintain homeostasis require the presence of all liver cell types. In vivo experiments offer only a snapshot of the liver, and usually involve perturbation of normal function through injury or experimental disease. The role of cell-cell interactions in maintaining normal liver function is far less understood than in pathological conditions. This may be because of the lack of methods in monitoring normal function in vivo. Culturing systems may capture pieces of the puzzle, but often capture only two cell types, and involve mediators presented to the cells in concentrations much higher than physiological values. In addition, the liver lobule contains a 3-dimensional metabolic zonation, and liver cell types comprise a heterogeneous population from the portal triad where the blood flows into the sinusoids to the central vein area where the blood flows out of the sinusoids. Liver cell types are dynamic responders to environmental cues from soluble factors to heterotypic cell interactions, to extracellular matrix proteins. Therefore, a system that serves to promote the health of all liver cell types through a 3-dimensional, perfused scaffold, and allows for self-organization of the liver cells in response to the engineered environment, would serve as a useful tool in understanding some of these complex, orchestrated events. In the research presented here, methods were developed to detect and characterize the heterogeneous population that makes up the hepatic stellate cell population inside the liver bioreactor (Griffith et. al).

Adult stem cells (ASC), which play the prime role in the maintenance and restoration of tissues, are thought to hold great potential for the advancement of medicine. It has been postulated that adult stem cells are able to retain \"immortal\" DNA template strands over successive generations by non-random chromosome co-segregation, and in so doing, to protect the long-term genomic fidelity of whole tissue compartments. The investigation of this theory may yield insights into areas such as the development of cancer and the process of aging. In addition, it may lead to the discovery of an effective method for the unique identification of adult stem cells, the study of which has thus far suffered from the lack of unique identifiers. Thus, the goal of this research was to develop an assay for the detection of immortal DNA strand co-segregation that could be applied to the detection and analysis of adult stem cells. It is proposed that such an assay may in itself serve as a unique identification method for adult stem cells. In this thesis, the development of such an assay is described. This assay, referred to as the label release assay, has provided further evidence for the existence of immortal strand co-segregation in model cell lines, and will potentially be useful in the study of adult stem cells in tissues.

This polymer has the unique properties of being cell resistant and chemically versatile such that various cell ligands can be coupled to its side chains. These properties allow adhesion through specific cell receptors to be studied without the effect of background adhesion to adsorbed proteins. By taking advantage of the ability to target specific receptors the comb polymer could be used as a powerful sorting tool. Sorting could be accomplished by finding cell type specific adhesion ligands. Several possible such ligands were screened. A ligand containing the tripeptide sequence RGD was found to elicit a strong cell adhesion response. However, this ligand is adherent to many cell types of the liver and would not be suitable for sorting purposes. Other cell type specific ligands tested showed little to no affinity for liver cell adhesion. Additionally, the comb was utilized to study α₅β₁ integrin-specific hepatocyte adhesion and the effect of Epidermal Growth Factor on adhesion. α₅β₁ integrin adhesion was mediated using a novel branched peptide, SynKRGD. This peptide consists of a linear peptide sequence containing RGDSP and the synergy site sequence PHSRN connected by the sequence GGKGGG. By utilizing the amine side group of Lysine a GGC branch was added.

These in vitro co-culture strategies have been limited by their inability to systematically characterize the addition of non-parenchymal cells. In this dissertation, I use gene expression levels quantified by real-time RT-PCR to determine tissue composition. The identified genes demonstrate significant cell-type specificity, magnitude, and stability of expression in vivo and throughout each step of cell isolation process. In the course of this development, we establish protocols to accurately isolate and count an enriched fraction of primary NPC's. Experiments on the perfusion and isolation process prove that there exists an inverse correlation between perfusion flow rate and NPC yield and viability. Further, we have characterized the tissue composition of each step in the cell isolation process and the resulting NPC population to confirm that a significant number of each NPC type is delivered to in vitro co-culture. System output analysis of spheroids co-cultured at physiological ratios and seeded into the milliF bioreactor shows the presence of stellate cells, but the absence of endothelial (EC) and kupffer cells (KC). The same analysis of 2D collagen gel sandwiches shows the presence of all NPC cell types.

The results of these measurements were used to calculate a characteristic length scale for oxygen diffusion limits in PGS scaffolds. Microfluidic scaffolds were then produced using fabrication techniques specific for PGS. Initial efforts have resulted in solid PGS-based scaffolds with biomimetic fluid flow and capillary channels on the order of 10 microns in width. These scaffolds have also been seeded with endothelial cells and perfused continuously in culture for up to 14 days resulting in partially confluent channels. More complex fabrication techniques were also demonstrated. A novel electrodeposition technique was used in the fabrication of biomimetic microfluidic masters. Thin-walled devices were also synthesized to accommodate the relatively low gas permeability of PGS. ",

Epidemiological studies have shown a correlation between exposure to AFBI and incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

Some of these observations are brought to the attention of public health officials in the hope that an environmental cause within these communities may be discovered and subsequently eliminated. However, what appears to be a cluster of cancer cases locally may be a chance occurrence when viewed from the perspective of the entire state or region. The primary aim of this work was to obtain and analyze a data set of sufficient magnitude to provide a means to discover if distributions of cancer mortality rates among communities within a particular state, for any of the most common forms of cancer, were compatible with chance. To this end cancer mortality data for six of the largest states in the United States (California, Florida, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas) were collected, converted into mortality rates and analyzed to discover if the variations among communities could be accounted for by chance alone. These data comprised one third of all recorded deaths in the period of approximately 1969 to 1998. The 21 most common forms of adult and 6 most common forms of pediatric cancers were organized to permit analyses within each of the 6 states with regard to age (0-19, 65-84 and >/= 85 years), gender and ethnicity (European American and Non-European American descent). Key to this work was the mode of statistical analysis. For each community an expected mortality rate and its expected distribution was defined by the average mortality rate for all communities within each state and the binomial distribution, respectively. These expected distributions were summed for all communities to define the expected chance distribution of community mortality rates for each state, cancer, gender, age cohort and ethnicity. This produced nearly 800 separate \"chance\" distributions. Each of these was compared to the corresponding observed distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smimov statistical test. This test was designed to discover statistically significant differences between any two distributions. Here it was used to determine which of the nearly 800 observed distributions could not be accounted for by chance alone. Of these comparisons, 16 were found to have observed distributions significantly different from the expected by chance distributions. All 16 had distributions that exhibited greater dispersion than expected by chance, and none had distributions with less dispersion than the chance expectation. ",

The specificity involved in the HSGAG-protein interactions stems from the structural heterogeneity of HSGAGs, which are highly acidic biopolymers associated on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix. It is believed that structural specificity in the HSGAG-protein interactions determines the biological functions mediated by HSGAG-binding proteins such as basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2). A number of models have been proposed to account for the mode of FGF-FGFR interactions and the role of HSGAGs in modulating FGF2 signaling. It was hypothesized that one role played by HSGAGs was to stabilize FGF2 oligomers in a \"side-by-side\" or cis fashion for presentation to fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR). In this thesis research, we systematically examined different proposed modes of FGF2 dimerization and showed that extensive oligomerization of a FGF2 mutant protein could be achieved by oxidatively crosslinking. Heparin, a highly sulfated form of HSGAGs, was demonstrated to increase the extent of oligomerization. Therefore, the results reported here were consistent with the hypothesis that HSGAGs promoted FGF2 oligomerization in a \"side-by-side\" mode.

Recent progress in coupling bacterial GAG-degrading enzymes with sensitive analytical techniques has led to a revolution in understanding the structure-function relationship for an important subset of GAGs, namely heparin/heparan sulfate-like glycosaminoglycans (HSGAGs). The study of chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate (CS/DS), an equally important subset of GAGs, has lagged behind partially due to a lack of enzymatic and analytical tools akin to those developed for HSGAGs. The Flavobacterial heparinases have proven indispensable in characterizing the fine structure of HSGAGs responsible for their different biological functions. As a continuation of ongoing research, a combination of chemical modification, peptide mapping, and site-directed mutagenesis was employed to explore the role of histidine in the activity of heparinase III. Of the thirteen histidines in the enzyme, His295 and His510 were found to be critical for the degradation of heparan sulfate by heparinase III. As a first step to developing the chondroitinases as enzymatic tools for the characterization of CS/DS oligosaccharides, recombinant expression and purification schemes were developed for chondroitinase AC and B from Flactobacterium heparinum. The recombinant enzymes were characterized using biochemical techniques and kinetic parameters were determined for their respective CS/DS substrates. ",

    "text": "Development of novel analytical tools for complex carbohydrates Complex carbohydrates such as the heparin/heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (HSGAGs) and the asparagine linked glycans (N-glycans) have emerged as crucial components of many human biological systems. Both classes of molecules have diverse roles in normal and pathological processes including development, cell growth, wound healing, angiogenesis, viral entry, and cancer. Taking advantage of the ability of carbohydrates to affect biological outcomes, several companies have already begun developing sugar-based structures as therapeutics for malaria and breast cancer, among others. However, the structural complexity that allows HSGAGs and N-glycans to exhibit such a wide array of activities also makes them more difficult to study than their protein and nucleotide counterparts. There are currently no effective methods for rapid synthesis of specific HSGAG or N-glycan structures, and until recently, most common analytical techniques were not useful in this field due to sensitivity constraints. Now, with advances in separation techniques and mass spectrometry, the fundamental roles of biological carbohydrates can be elucidated more efficiently. However, there is still a need for improved methodologies for studying these classes of molecules. This thesis describes the development of a novel technique for the direct isolation and sequencing of protein-binding HSGAG oligosaccharides. As a proof-of-concept, we used heparin and HSGAG-binding proteins of known specificity (fibroblast growth factor and antithrombin III), then utilized the technique to identify an oligosaccharide binder for a protein with unknown HSGAG binding specificity (endostatin). Furthermore, this technique can be readily applied to carbohydrate material from the cell surface. We have ",

These threats to the genetic integrity of cells are caused by exogenous and endogenous oxidizing agents and may contribute to diseases such as cancer. To better understand the role of oxidative DNA damage in these diseases, it is necessary to quantify deoxyribose oxidation both in vitro and in vivo. Current methods lack the sensitivity required to measure low concentrations of deoxyribose oxidation products. The goals of the research findings reported here is to develop a sensitive method that can accurately and reproducibly quantify 3'-phosphoglycolaldehyde (PGA), one example of a deoxyribose oxidation product, and to apply the method to quantify PGA in vitro and in cells. Given the presence of reactive carbonyl groups in many deoxyribose oxidation products, the method should be widely applicable to other studies of oxidative ])NA damage. The analytical method exploits the reactive carbonyl moiety in PGA by derivatization as a stable oxime with pentafluorobenzylhydroxylamine, followed by solvent extraction and gas chromatography/negative chemical ionization/mass spectrometry. A stable isotopically-labeled [13C2]-PGA is synthesized and used as an internal standard. The method is linear in response over the range of 30 fmol to 300 pmol and precision is verified by analysis of a synthetic, PGA-containing oligodeoxynucleotide. The limit of detection in the presence of DNA is 30 fmol of PGA. The analytical method was then applied to the quantification of PGA in purified DNA and cultured cells treated with several oxidants.

This work consists of an investigation into two possible methods for determining the role of genes involved in the DNA and cellular damage response, though the methods are generally applicable to investigating a wide variety of biological pathways and responses. A library of approximately 4,800 yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) deletion strains produced by the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project and consisting essentially of all possible mutants having one non-essential gene deleted (and replaced with unique identification tags called \"bar codes\") from the genome are employed in this endeavor. The methods focus on gathering phenotype data in a high-throughput manner and in response to the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). The first method makes use of a new technology called the Living ChipTM, which can hold libraries of compounds or cell cultures in an array of 50-nl channels and which could ideally accommodate all deletion strains on a single array. The second method involves pooling all strains together in a single culture and allowing them to grow competitively to determine their relative fitness based on a specific treatment. ",

These cells come from the pre-implantation embryo, whose native environment is the hypoxic mammalian reproductive tract. Growing stem cells in an environment with higher oxygen levels (i.e. the atmospheric oxygen levels that are normally used to cultivate stem cells) could be bad for the cells, as oxygen is toxic due to its powerful oxidative capacity. In this experiment, J1 murine embryonic stem cells were grown at 0%, 2%, 5%, 10%, and 20% oxygen by volume to assess the effects that lower oxygen levels have on stem cell growth, plating efficiency, and metabolism. Two reaction vessels were built so that the cells could be grown in a controlled environment. Premixed gas cylinders were used to flush the vessels and an optical probe was used to measure the headspace oxygen concentration. Cells were found to grow faster than atmospheric conditions when in a moderately hypoxic environment where the oxygen concentration was between 2% and 10%, and considerably slower than atmospheric conditions as the headspace oxygen concentration approached zero. Maximum cell density decreased, glucose-lactate yield increased, glucose-cell yield decreased, and glutamine-cell yield decreased as headspace oxygen decreased. There were no strong correlations between oxygen concentration and glutamine-ammonia yield or plating efficiency. From the results of this study, it appears that it may be preferable to grow murine embryonic stem cells in a moderately hypoxic environment around 10% oxygen to increase the growth rate while minimizing the maximum cell density and metabolic inefficiency compromises.

In this research, an ES cell line with transfected green fluorescent protein (GFP) co-expressed by an Oct-4 promoter was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) to obtain such profile. As Oct-4 is an ES cell differentiation marker whose expression varies with pluripotency, GFP expression could simply be measured in these cells to determine how pluripotent they are as a population. The differentiation characterization of ES cells was also conducted with different culture conditions of reduced serum and glucose concentrations both in the presence and absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) which prevents spontaneous differentiation, as well as at varied LIF concentrations and seeding densities. In addition, fundamental growth kinetic and metabolic profiles were obtained to get a more complete picture of how ES cells behave under these varied culturing conditions. The doubling time (t[sub]d) of R1 Oct4-GFP cell line was found to be 13 hours in LIF⁺ culture and 8 hours in culture with LIF addition after 7 days of LIF withdrawal, implying that cell proliferation rate is higher for cells receiving a sudden upregulation of genes controlling cell division through LIF addition. Although the upregulation of the genes is rapid, the downregulation of these genes through LIF withdrawal was found to take 6-7 days, while 3-4 days were required to downregulate the pou5f gene (which controls Oct4 expression).

Moderate increases ([approximately]30%) in nucleobase deamination products were observed in the SJL mice bearing the RcsX tumor, but the biological meaning of these increases awaits studies of DNA repair kinetics. dO was not detected in any study at levels above 5 per 10⁸ nt, leading to the prediction that it will not be present at significant levels in inflamed tissues in humans. As a complement to the LC-MS method for the quantification of nucleobase deamination products, enzymatic probes were also developed for oxidative and nitrosative DNA lesions. These probes would not only allow differential quantification of the two types of DNA damage, but would also allow the lesions to be mapped in any DNA sequence by coupling their activity with the technique of ligation-mediated PCR. As an extension of the biomarker study, the effects of ONOO⁻ dose and dose-rate on the DNA damage and mutations induced in the supF gene were investigated. The observations suggest that both the dose and dose-rate at which a genetic target is exposed to ONOO⁻ substantially influence the damage and mutational response and these parameters will need to be considered in assessing the potential effects of ONOO⁻ in vivo. Finally, an extended study using the analytical method developed in this thesis yielded results in E. coli consistent with a new paradigm: perturbations of nucleobase metabolism may lead to incorporation of the purine precursors hypoxanthine (I) and xanthine (X) into DNA.

However, numerous studies have revealed important differences between TIMP family members in their ability to inhibit angiogenic processes in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo despite their universal ability to inhibit matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity. To address these differences, structure-function studies were conducted to identify and characterize the anti-angiogenic domains of TIMP-2, the endogenous MMP inhibitor that uniquely inhibits capillary endothelial cell (EC) proliferation and angiogenesis in vivo. Only the carboxy-terminal domain of TIMP-2 (T2C) and not the MMP-inhibitory N-terminal domain (T2N), inhibited capillary EC proliferation. Although both T2N and T2C inhibited embryonic angiogenesis, only T2C potently inhibited mitogen-stimulated angiogenesis. These findings demonstrate that TIMP-2 possesses two distinct types of anti-angiogenic activities which can be uncoupled from each other. The anti-proliferative activity of T2C was further mapped to the 24-amino acid peptide, Loop 6, which proved to be a potent inhibitor of both embryonic and nitogen-stimulated angiogenesis in vivo. Initial studies into the mechanism(s) by which Loop 6 inhibits angiogenesis revealed that the anti-proliferative effects of Loop 6 are due, at least in part, to the inhibition of cell cycle progression and not to the induction of apoptosis. This inhibition was associated with increased levels of cell cycle inhibitor p27. Although Loop 6 did not compete with bFGF for binding to its receptor, ",

In these studies, a self-assembling peptide hydrogel is evaluated as a potential scaffold for cartilage repair using a model bovine cell source. A seeding technique is developed for 3-D encapsulation of chondrocytes in a peptide hydrogel. The chondrocyte-seeded peptide hydrogel was then evaluated cellular activities in vitro under standard culture conditions and also when subjected to dynamic compression. During 4 weeks of culture in vitro, chondrocytes seeded within the peptide hydrogel retained their morphology and developed a cartilage-like ECM rich in proteoglycans and type II collagen, indicative of a stable chondrocyte phenotype. Time dependent accumulation of this ECM was paralleled by increases in material stiffness, indicative of deposition of mechanically-functional neo-tissue. Culture of chondrocyte-seeded peptide hydrogels in ITS-supplemented medium was investigated as an alternative to high serum culture. Low serum (0.2%), ITS-supplemented medium was found to maintain high levels of cell division and extracellular matrix synthesis and accumulation, as seen in high serum culture. Furthermore, low serum, ITS medium induced minimal chondrocyte de-differentiation on the surface of the hydrogel. This is in contrast to high serum culture, where surface de-differentiation and subsequent proliferation led to a 5-10 cell thick layer that stained positive for type I collagen. ",

Given that such genetic changes may promote tumorigenesis, it is critical to identify those genetic and environmental factors that render cells susceptible to homologous recombination. Our goal is to elucidate the mechanisms of DNA damage-induced recombination and to determine the role of DNA repair enzymes in modulating homologous recombination in eukaryotic cells.

In addition to their mutagenic and cytotoxic effects, alkylating agents stimulate homologous recombination in eukaryotic cells.

To investigate the molecular basis for methylation-induced homologous recombination in S. cerevisiae, intrachromosomal recombination was measured under conditions where MAGI expression levels were varied. Cells lacking Magl show increased susceptibility to methylation-induced recombination, suggesting that unrepaired 3MeA lesions induce recombination.

Therefore it is important to understand the specificity of glycan-protein interactions and how these specific interactions influence their structure-function relationships. This thesis addresses many challenges in this emerging area of glycomics, by taking an integrated approach that couples biophysical and biochemical methods with a bioinformatics framework to represent and process sequence information content in GAGs. With this motivation the thesis is divided into 4 components 1. Using heparin/heparan sulfate GAGs (HSGAGs) - fibroblast growth factor (FGF) as a model GAG-protein system, the first part focuses on determining the structural basis of FGF oligomerization, sequence specific FGF-HSGAG interactions and FGF-receptor (FGFR) interactions which collectively influence the specificity of HSGAG mediated FGF signaling. 2. The second part focuses on developing enzymatic tools for analysis of GAGs using chondroitinase B, HSGAG 2-0 sulfatase and 3-0 sulfotransferase as model enzymes. For each of these enzymes a theoretical model for the enzyme-substrate structural complex is developed and it is coupled with the site directed mutagenesis and biochemical studies to determine its catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity. 3.

Due to a lack of effective tools to study structure-function relationship of these complex molecules, the role(s) of HLGAGs in cancer remains largely indirect and poorly understood. To study the role(s) of HLGAGs in cancer growth, metastasis and angiogenesis, tumor systems were studied using heparinases I and III which have distinct substrate specificities. Studies, focusing on the biochemistry of the heparinase active site, elucidated key interactions important for enzymatic activities, thus enabling the biological studies presented here. In vitro cell culture study with heparinases as tools clearly showed that cell surface HLGAGs are involved in regulating fundamental cellular activities including cell proliferation, invasion and adhesion. Significantly, heparinase I and III demonstrated distinct effect on these cellular activities with heparinase III inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, invasion and adhesion in selected model systems and heparinase I inhibiting these processes. Further in vivo studies in animal tumor models confirmed and expanded the distinct responses to heparinase I and III treatment. HLGAG fragments generated from heparinase treatment were found to be responsible for the effect of heparinase treatment in tumor models. Moreover, cell surface HLGAGs containing cryptic activatory and inhibitory sequence information were identified and characterized.

In this Thesis, we investigate affinity maturation of antibodies for very high affinity binding. Two single chain antigen-binding fragment (scFv) antibody systems that were engineered to obtain higher affinity interactions through directed evolution were probed using biophysical techniques to illuminate affinity modulation in proteins.

The focus has broadened to include epigenetic mechanisms in changing gene expression. The association between chronic infection, chronic inflammation and increased cancer risk has been supported by epidemiologic studies. Data link chronic inflammation associated with infectious disease to increased cancer risk.

We used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching combined with intravital microscopy to quantitate the transport properties of the tumor interstitium. We found that the presence of fibrillar collagen correlated with hindered diffusion in vivo, and also in vitro, in collagen gels prepared to mimic tumor extracellular matrix. Modification of the tumor collagen matrix directly with purified bacterial collagenase, or indirectly with relaxin treatment, resulted in increased diffusion coefficients of macromolecules within tumors in vivo. In order to quantitate the changes in collagen content and structure induced by relaxin treatment, we adapted and further developed the imaging technique of intravital second harmonic generation microscopy. Using second harmonic generation imaging in combination with a fluorescently labeled gene therapeutic vector, we demonstrated that the spread of these viral vectors within tumors is limited by the fibrillar collagen in the extracellular matrix. Matrix modification via the introduction of bacterial collagenase along with the initial virus injection resulted in a significant improvement in the range of viral distribution within the tumor. ",

Although the mechanism by which injury leads to joint degeneration remains to be elucidated, several injury-related factors may contribute to the development of OA. These factors include but are not limited to altered mechanical loading and initiation of a cellular response in cartilage or other joint tissues at the time of the injury. Three in vitro models of joint injury were investigated to separately evaluate the effects on cartilage of mechanical overloading and damage to joint capsule and synovial lining. Models of injury included (1) mechanical injury lto cartilage explants alone, (2) co-culture of normal cartilage explants with an excised specimen of joint capsule tissue, and (3) co-culture of mechanically injured cartilage explants with excised joint capsule tissue. These models have been shown previously to result in matrix damage and decreased biosynthesis by the chondrocytes. We measured gene expression levels of matrix molecules and matrix proteases and found them to be expressed in control cartilage at levels ranging over five orders of magnitude, and to be differentially regulated in these three models of joint injury.

These engineering tools are also useful for many biological applications ranging from drug delivery to DNA sequencing, since they can be used to fabricate small features at a low cost and in a reproducible manner. The goal of this thesis was to develop techniques based on the merger of novel materials and nano and microfabrication approaches to manipulate cell microenvironment in culture. To control cell migration and to restrict cell or colony size, cells and proteins were patterned by using molding or printing methods. Poly(ethylene glycol)-based molecules and polysaccharides were used to control cell-substrate interactions and to prevent cell adhesion on specific regions of a substrate. To control cell-cell contact, layer-by-layer deposition of ionic biopolymers (i.e. negatively charged hyaluronic acid and positively charged poly-L-lysine) was used to generate patterned co-cultures. In addition, to control cell-soluble factor interactions, microfluidic-based approaches were developed. To pattern cells and proteins within microchannels, a soft lithographic method was developed to pattern microchannel substrates using printing and molding approaches. ",

This question has drawn considerable interest since 1972, when it was first discovered that cells have an intrinsic ability to self-destruct through a process called apoptosis. Since then, apoptosis has been shown to play a critical role in both normal physiology and disease. In addition, many of the basic molecular mechanisms that control apoptosis have been revealed. Yet despite the known list of interactions and regulators, it remains difficult to inspect the network of apoptosis-related proteins and predict how cells will behave. The challenge is even greater when one considers interactions with other networks that are anti-apoptotic, such as growth-factor networks. In this thesis, we develop an approach to measure, analyze, and predict how complex intracellular signaling networks transduce extracellular stimuli into cellular fates. This approach entails three interrelated aims: 1) to develop high-throughput, quantitative techniques that measure key nodes in the intracellular network; 2) to characterize the quantitative changes in network state and cell behavior by exposing cells to diverse fate-changing stimuli; and 3) to use data-driven modeling approaches that analyze large signaling-response datasets to suggest new biological hypotheses.

Comb copolymer comprising a methyl methacrylate backbone with 10-mer poly(oxyethylene) sidechains was selected as the vehicle to present small adhesion peptides at the surface. This polymer shows excellent performance in cell resistance studies and offers sufficient functionalizable sites to create high local densities of ligands. Methods for preparing comb copolymer substrates with peptides in [approx.] 300 nm² clusters with inter-ligand spacings closer than integrins were developed. This nanometer-scale clustered presentation was favorable to integrin binding. Cells were more spread on RGD peptide substrates with a higher degree of nanoscale clustering but of the same overall peptide surface density as comparable substrates with lower degree of peptide clustering.

Alterations in the biosynthesis of this molecule over time could impact the ability of the tissue to perform its necessary functions. Several factors have been shown to alter the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate in cartilage; among them are age, disease, depth of tissue, and mechanical compression. Specifically, mechanical compression has been shown to have a significant effect on the sulfation pattern and chain length and number in cartilage explant studies. The mechanisms that govern these alterations, however, have not been determined. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of mechanical compression on chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis and analyze the roles of two possible mechanisms; enzyme transcription and organelle deformation. The effects of mechanical compression on the transcription rates of enzymes associated with the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate have not been previously studied. To perform this study in a bovine model, portions of the bovine genome had to be sequenced, PCR primers designed, and bulk expression levels determined. Static compression resulted in the significant up-regulation of two genes of interest: chondroitin sulfate and GalNAc 4S,6-sulfotransferase. ",

Mathematical models in terms of these parameters' effects and their interactions were proposed for each of the responses. The significance of each effect and interaction, as well as the goodness-of-fit of mathematical models to data were examined by analysis of variance. It was found that biomass (with R²Adj=0.951) is a strong function of glycerol concentration (higher glycerol concentration leads to higher biomass), but it varies much less with agitation, and it is completely independent of salt concentration. Growth rate (R²Adj=0.901), however, varies strongly with agitation and salt concentration, but much more weakly with glycerol concentration. Protein production has a low R²Adj value of 0.746, implying that higher-order terms, e.g. x₁² and x₂², should be tested for significance in the model. ",

We aimed to test this hypothesis and to determine its validity across cancer cell types. In addition, we hoped to explain the involvement of certain kinases in nitric oxide-induced apoptosis. The experimental setup involved stimulating human colorectal cancer cells, HT-29 and HCT- 116, and human prostate cancer cells, LNCaP, with cytokines in order to induce cell death. Then, we observed the effects of NO inhibitors, kinase inhibitors, and activation of Akt, a kinase up-stream of the caspase cascade, following transfection of a DNA sequence that was proven to protect cells against apoptosis induction. In our series of experiments, inhibition of the nitric oxide synthases removes nitric oxide protection from apoptosis, but inhibition of only the inducible synthase has opposite effects with prostate and colon cancer cells that are considered insignificant, and its effects on the two types of colon cancer cells are in discord. Transformation and transfection of ARK5 into the colorectal cancer cell line, HT-29 did not prove beneficial. Similarly, glucosamine showed no clear pattern of reducing apoptosis in the cells. Therefore, we propose further exploration of the inhibition of constitutive nitric oxide synthases as a potential therapy. ",

However, these applications are limited because of the difficulty in isolating and expanding pure populations of adult stem cells (ASCs). A major barrier to ASC expansion in vitro is their property of asymmetric cell kinetics. Our lab has developed a method, Suppression of Asymmetric Cell Kinetics (SACK), to expand ASCs in vitro by shifting their cell kinetics program from asymmetric to symmetric. We have found that guanine nucleotide precursors can be used to convert the kinetics of adult stem cells from asymmetric to symmetric, which promotes their exponential expansion. Previously, we have used the SACK method to derive hepatic and cholangiocyte stem cell strains from adult rat livers in vitro. These cell strains provide an assay to evaluate whether growth factors and cytokines previously implicated in proliferation of progenitor cells act by converting the kinetics of the stem cells in the population from asymmetric to symmetric, and thus identify new SACK agents.

The intrinsic sequence variety stemming from the large number of building blocks that compose this biopolymer leads to substantial information density as well as to the ability to regulate a wide variety of important biological processes. With the recent and progressive emergence of biochemical and analytical tools to probe GAG structure and function, efforts can be taken to understand the role of GAGs in cell biology and in disease in the various physiological locations where GAGs can exist. As a first step to probe the functions of GAGs, the heparin/heparan sulfate-GAG (HSGAG)-fibroblast growth factor (FGF) system was examined. Understanding the role of HSGAGs in inducing FGF2 dimerization led to the development of a novel engineered protein that was found to be effective at promoting functional recovery in stroke. Subsequently, methods to isolate HSGAGs from the cell surface were optimized and the ability of HSGAGs to support FGF signaling was investigated. Cell surface HSGAGs can define the responsiveness of a given cell to FGF1 and FGF2 through multiple receptor isoforms. Stromal cell derived HSGAGs were also identified as critical regulators of tumor cell growth and metastasis, effecting not only FGF2., but also 1-integrin signaling. ",

Hepatocyte adhesion environments were examined in two settings: spheroid culture prior to seeding in the bioreactor and 2D surface culture methods that could be applied to the bioreactor scaffold. Spheroids were formed either by culturing in spinning suspension or on a static, non-adherent surface. In spheroid culture, the addition of extracellular matrix (ECM) signaling through the use of soluble Matrigel or adhesion protein-coated microspheres did not improve hepatocyte viability or function as assessed by liver-specific gene expression. These results suggest the importance of cell-cell rather than cell-surface interactions in maintaining hepatocytes. Optimal culturing of spheroids in spinning suspension without the ECM addition was found to be 3 days without media changes. 2D surfaces were treated with an adhesion peptide-conjugated comb polymer, preventing nonspecific cell adhesion and allowing attachment through the [alpha]₅[beta]₁ integrin.

Anti-angiogenics alone have not proven effective in inducing tumor regression in the clinic due to both the cytostatic nature of anti-angiogenic therapy and the potential formation of new regions of hypoxia within the tumor after therapy. The new therapeutic paradigm is for combining both anti-angiogenics and traditional cytotoxic agents for a synergistic effect. The efficacy of cytotoxic agents may be reduced after anti-angiogenic therapy, however, due to limited access to tumor vasculature and hypoxia-induced drug resistance. We propose that loading cytotoxic agents within the tumor prior to blood vessel collapse will enable both greater drug accumulation within the tumor as well as a reduction in the formation of therapy-induced regions of hypoxia. We present here a novel nanodelivery vehicle termed a 'nanocell' for the spatio-temporal recruitment of both anti-angiogenics and cytotoxic agents within the solid tumor to achieve this goal. Nanocells consist of a polymeric nanocore encapsulating the cytostatic agent doxorubicin surrounded by a lipid vesicle containing the anti-angiogenic agent combretastatin A4. ",

Measuring the force applied in real-time is dependent on detecting the bead's displacement from the trapping laser beam axis.

This technique can detect the arrival of a single molecule into a small volume of space or detect the conformational changes of a single molecule. Combining optical tweezers with single-molecule fluorescence so that one can apply forces on a single molecule while monitoring its effects via single molecule fluorescence provides an even more powerful experimental platform to perform such microscopic studies.

However, this hypothesis has not been tested by an assay of nuclear point mutations in lungs of smokers and nonsmokers. Mismatch amplification mutation assay (MAMA), an effective form of allele-specific PCR, was applied for detection of point mutations in TP53 bp742, bp746 and bp747, K-ras bp35 and HPRT bp508 from a total of 291 tracheal-bronchial epithelial sectors from six smokers and nine non-smokers, yielding 949 individual mutational assays.

From evaluation of whole genome transcript levels to expand the SRPA gene pool, 543 SRPA genes were discovered.

Specifically, 2,6-dimethylaniline (2,6-DMA), 3,5-dimethylaniline (3,5-DMA), and 3-ethylaniline (3EA) have been associated with an increased risk of human bladder cancer, independent of cigarette smoking, in a published case-control study. Understanding the metabolic activation of and DNA adduct formation by these chemicals is an important first step in elucidating their mechanisms of carcinogenesis and toxicity. Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism was profiled based on the hypothesis that N-hydroxylated metabolites are critical intermediates in the formation of DNA adducts. This work was extended to assess in vitro DNA adduct formation with the cell-free and cell-based assays. Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) was used for detection and semi-quantification of DNA adducts formed by 14C-labeled alkylanilines. Data indicated 3,5-DMA formed high levels of DNA adducts, suggesting that it is a potent carcinogen. Additionally, the levels of adducts exhibited inter-species variation. The effects of phase II metabolism on adduct formation were evaluated by comparing the results obtained from the two types of assays and by assessing the effects of phase II enzyme cofactors on the results of cell-free assay.

However, the response of CTP to most growth factors and cytokines is unknown. Many envisioned applications of CTP, such as treating large defects in bone, involve in vivo implantation of CTP attached to a scaffold, a process that creates an acute inflammatory environment that may be hostile to CTP survival. This project entails the design of a two-component polymeric implant system to aid in the healing process of bony defects by influencing cell behaviors at the implant site through the covalent modification of the implant surface with selected ligands. We investigate cellular responses of CTP on a biomaterial surface covalently modified with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and find that surface-tethered EGF (tEGF) promotes both cell spreading and survival more strongly than saturating concentrations of soluble EGF. By sustaining MEK-ERK signaling, tEGF increases the contact of CTP with an otherwise moderately adhesive synthetic polymer and confers resistance to apoptosis induced by the proinflammatory cytokine, FasL.

This deformation has been shown to result in significant reductions in both the shear storage and shear loss moduli of the cell, with subsequent recovery towards their initial values. Also, deformation above a threshold stimulus results in neutrophil activation, evidenced by pseudopod projection from the cell. These two events are thought to occur via independent pathways, yet little is known about the mechanosensing signaling involved. Other work has demonstrated that physiological deformation of neutrophils induces a marked increase in the levels of cytosolic calcium, suggesting that this occurrence may trigger the biomechanical response observed in the cell. The aim of this thesis was to elucidate the role of calcium in the neutrophil response to the mechanical deformation experienced during transit through the pulmonary capillaries. ",

The desire is to differentiate among diseased and healthy cells, cell age, and cell type with the minimum amount of sample pretreatment. This project addresses this need by developing microfluidic devices that exploit the adhesion differences between cell states and cell types to rapidly count cells of different types without the need for labels. There are two avenues in which to explore cell adhesion differences with these devices, the first is a net electrostatic change at the surface of the cell wall and the second is the presence of specific cell-membrane adhesion proteins. It is hypothesized that the forced interaction of the cell wall with the microfabricated microcapillary walls would result in a differential velocity based on cell type that could be detected simply using a microscope and video camera or an interferometer. The eventual integration of cell velocity detection would result in a portable all-inclusive lab-on-a-chip system that could be used in the field for detecting the presence of diseases, such as malaria and cancer as well as in a lab setting for drug discovery.

However, the design principles governing the construction and operation of these networks remain mostly unknown. To discover design principles in these networks, we investigated and developed a set of computational tools described below. First, we looked into the application of optimization techniques to explore network topology, parameterization, or both, and to evaluate relative fitness of networks operational strategies. In particular, we studied the ability of an enzymatic cycle to produce dynamic properties such as responsiveness and transient noise filtering. We discovered that non-linearity of the enzymatic cycle allows more effective filtering of transient noise. Furthermore, we found that networks with multiple activation steps, despite being less responsive, are better in filtering transient noise. Second, we explored a method to construct compact models of signal transduction networks based on a protein-domain network representation. This method generates models whose number of species, in the worst case, scales quadratically to the number of protein-domain sites and modification states, a tremendous saving over the combinatorial scaling in the more standard mass-action model was estimated to consist of more that 10⁷ species and was too large to simulate; however, a simplified model consists of only 132 state variables and produced intuitive behavior. The resulting models were utilized to study the roles of a scaffold protein and of a shared binding domain to pathway functions. ",

Using RNA interference or peptide inhibitors to downregulate specific connexins we examined the role of gap junctions in intercellular diffusion, calcium excitation, and in mediating the expression of vascular regulators transforming growth factor-[Beta][ (TGF-[beta]), prostacyclin, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). siRNA inhibition of connexin 43 in porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAEC) significantly decreased the diffusion distance of Lucifer yellow dye and cytoplasmic calcium levels after mechanical wounding. Wound healing experiments suggested that stimulatory signals travel through gap junctions containing connexin 43, while inhibitory signal travel through gap junctions containing connexin 37. Connexin 43 and connexin 37 inhibition, alone or in combination, reduced the levels of secreted latent TGF-[beta] in confluent PAEC monolayers after 24 hours of incubation. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) behaved in a similar manner. Inhibition of any one of the three connexins resulted in a marked increase in eNOS concentration. ",

Fibrous structures with directionally ordered phage were obtained by interaction with cobalt ions.

Creating a more productive expression host for the manufacture of these proteins is a potential solution. Although heterologous proteins are frequently made in organisms as disparate as E. coli and bovines, the single-celled organism S. cerevisiae has emerged as a well-qualified candidate due to its approachable genetic and fermentation attributes as well as its ability to stably fold disulfide bonded and multi domain proteins. Because S. cerevisiae screens for enhanced protein secretion have traditionally utilized low-throughput and often plate-based methods, a high-throughput, liquid phase assay could offer a real advantage in secretory selection. In this thesis, yeast surface display is investigated as a potential proxy for heterologous protein secretion. Although ultimately unsuitable as a screening proxy, the surface display experiments did show a novel method of improving protein secretion by co-expressing a more stably folded protein with the protein of interest.

To date, no robust, efficient method for the pure, ex vivo expansion of human HSCs has been demonstrated. Previous methods primarily induced the expansion of committed hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), yielding even less pure populations of HSCs. This research was based on the hypothesis that, like for other adult stem cells (ASCs), the major barrier to expanding HSCs ex vivo is in preferentially regulating the asymmetric self-renewal of HSCs without loss in their ability to produce differentiated committed HPCs. This laboratory has shown that a p53-dependent pathway specifically controls the self-renewal pattern of several types of ASCs and thereby provides an effective means for expansion of ASCs in culture. The method, which involves the use of purine metabolites to achieve suppression of asymmetric cell kinetics, is referred to as SACK. The utility of the p53-dependent pathway was investigated for directing expansion of human HSCs. In order to support this investigation, the proliferation of HPCs in in vitro cultures was repressed by culturing cells without hematopoietic growth factors and cytokines. ",

Research currently involves mass screenings of different combinations of vector components without a true understanding of how each component interacts with the target cell. Few tools are currently available for scientists to quantitatively examine these vector-to-cell interactions or determine the rate limiting steps within the gene delivery pathway. Thus, researchers cannot fully optimize the vector design to reach maximal delivery efficiency. This project seeks to address this issue by modifying a density gradient electrophoresis (DGE) device originally developed on Mel Juso cells to segregate primary rat hepatocyte lysate into nuclear, early endosomal, late endosomal/lysosomal, and cytoplasmic fractions. We found that according to the Horseradish Peroxidase assay, late endosomes and lysosomes consistently localize to fractions 11-13 and early endosomes in fractions 18 to 21. There was minimal labeling in fractions 14 through 17 demonstrating that separation of the organelles was achieved. With this higher resolution fractionation, movement through the endosomal pathway can be studied in greater detail. ",

Recombinant protein subunits and peptides are relatively safe alternatives to live attenuated pathogens.

Our objectives were to elucidate the extent and kinetics of the chondrocyte transcriptional response to combined IGF-1 and static compression in cartilage explants. Discussion: Clustering analysis revealed five distinct groups. TIMP-3 and ADAMTS-5, MMP-l and IGF-2, and IGF-1 and Collagen II, were all robustly co-expressed under all conditions tested.

Deep ultraviolet microscopy received attention in the 1950s as a way to generate image contrast from the strong absorbance of proteins and nucleic acids at wavelengths shorter than 300 nm. However, the lethal effects of these wavelengths limited their usefulness in studies of cell function, separating the contributions of protein and nucleic acid proved difficult, and scattering artifacts were a significant concern. We have used short exposures of deep-ultraviolet light synchronized with an ultraviolet-sensitive camera to observe mitosis and motility in living cells without causing necrosis, and quantified absorbance at 280 nm and 260 nm together with tryptophan native fluorescence in order to calculate maps of nucleic acid mass, protein mass, and quantum yield in unlabeled cells. We have also developed a method using images acquired at 320nm and 340nm, and an equation for Mie scattering, to determine a scattering correction factor for each pixel at 260nm and 280nm.

Our de novo reconstruction of a T-cell signaling map was highly accurate, closely reproducing the known pathway structure, and accurately predicted novel pathway connections.

This thesis presents methods for the analysis and design of rationally and evolutionarily designed molecules and focuses on applying these methods to make protein and small molecule changes more strategically. First, electrostatic analysis of a series of small molecule neuraminidase inhibitors was used to demonstrate that charge optimization improves the electrostatic component of the binding free energy, despite changes in binding mode and discrete chemical constraints. Additionally, chemical changes suggested by charge optimization frequently corresponded to tighter-binding inhibitors, indicating that this technique would be useful for the design of future inhibitors. Second, computational sequence and structure analysis were used to study the PDZ3-CRIPT binding interaction and a method for sequence analysis was developed to locate residues important for binding specificity. Third, computational analysis of the horseradish peroxidase active site suggested five positions as candidates for mutation, and further studies of new mutant enzymes let to ideas for the improvement of computational enzyme design procedures. Finally, both computational protein design techniques and a model of the evolutionary process were used to study the efficiency of evolution as a tool for creating new proteins in the laboratory. We identified sequences that serve as better evolutionary starting points that others and provide a general framework for considering the impact of protein structure on the allowed sequence space and therefore on the challenges that each protein presents to evolutionary protein engineering procedures.

While the structural and physiological consequences of negative supercoiling have been well studied, technical challenges have prevented extensive examination of positively supercoiled DNA. Studies suggest that at sufficiently high levels of overwinding, DNA relieves strain by adopting an elongated structure, where the bases are positioned extrahelically and the backbones occupy the center of the helix. This transition has only been identified, however, at a degree of supercoiling substantially higher than is generated physiologically. To examine the structural changes resulting from physiological levels of positive DNA supercoiling, I have developed a method for preparing highly purified positively supercoiled plasmid substrates. Based on a method previously developed in this laboratory, this allows for preparation of large quantities of very pure, highly positively supercoiled plasmid. It also expands on earlier methods by exploiting ionic strength to modulate the direction of supercoiling introduced, allowing preparation of either positively or negatively supercoiled substrates.

Despite the pathophysiological importance of autocrine systems, how protease-mediated ligand release quantitatively influences receptor-mediated signaling and consequent cell behavior is poorly understood. Therefore, we explored the relationship between autocrine EGF release rate and receptor-mediated ERK activation and migration in human mammary epithelial cells. A quantitative spectrum of EGF release rates was achieved using chimeric EGF ligand precursors modulated by the addition of the metalloprotease inhibitor batimastat. We found that ERK activation increased with increasing ligand release rates despite concomitant EGF receptor downregulation. ",

This thesis is focused on constructing such models for gene expression during bacteriophage T7 infection. T7 gene expression is a particularly well suited model system because knowledge of how the phage functions is thought to be relatively complete. My work focuses on two questions in particular. First, can we address deficiencies in past simulations and measurements of bacteriophage T7 to improve models of gene expression? Second, can we design and build refactored surrogates of T7 that are easier to understand and model? To address deficiencies in past simulations and measurements, I developed a new single-molecule, base-pair-resolved gene expression simulator named Tabasco that can faithfully represent mechanisms thought to govern phage gene expression. I used Tabasco to construct a model of T7 gene expression that encodes our mechanistic understanding. The model displayed significant discrepancies from new system-wide measurements of absolute T7 mRNA levels during infection. ",

Although homologous recombination is generally error-free, recombination between misaligned sequences can lead to deleterious sequence rearrangements, and conditions that stimulate homologous recombination are associated with an increased risk of cancer. To study homologous recombination in vivo, we used Fluorescent Yellow Direct Repeat (FYDR) mice in which a homologous recombination event at a transgene yields a fluorescent cell. To study homologous recombination using FYDR mice, we developed one- and two-photon in situ imaging techniques that reveal both the frequency and the sizes of isolated recombinant cell clusters within intact pancreatic tissue. We then applied these tools to analyze the effects of cancer risk factors such as exposure, genetic predisposition and age on homologous recombination in vivo. To determine the effect of exposure to exogenous carcinogens on homologous recombination, FYDR mice were treated with two different chemotherapeutic agents, cisplatin and mitomycin-C. ",

However, after more than three decades of research and development efforts, clinical success has yet to be realized. Successful delivery of DNA is a crucial first step in attaining safe and effective gene therapeutics. While vectors based upon recombinant viruses have shown high delivery and transfection efficiencies, they may also pose certain health risks to patients, can be difficult to target to cell or tissue types of interest, and present difficulties for large-scale manufacturing. Non-viral vectors look to offer a safer alternative and can be engineered to more effectively treat a specific cell type, tissue, or pathology, but these vectors are still plagued with low transfection levels and cannot provide adequate and sustained levels of gene expression. Continued efforts focus on producing next generation non-viral vectors that safely deliver therapeutic transgenes with the efficiency of their viral counterparts. Many barriers exist in the successful trafficking of these non-viral complexes to the nucleus. ",

A tissue-engineered liver for transplantation will require complex structures to support cell differentiation and integration with surrounding vasculature. Recent developments in 3D-printing (3DP™) technology allow the construction of such geometrically complex scaffolds out of biodegradable polymers. These artificial tissues should maintain healthy, functional hepatocytes in proper contact with supporting cell types in the context of proper flow cues. This project comprises three major efforts. First, the design and development of a 3D-printed scaffold, constructed of a porous biodegradable polymer matrix, for flow bioreactor culture. Second, the development of protocols for the production, preparation, and flow support of these scaffolds. And third, the employment of standard cell culture methodologies to test the ability of these scaffolds to support liver tissue cultures. Initial cell culture experiments showed similar rates of albumin production in the polymer disk scaffolds compared to cells in silicon-chip scaffolds under appropriately scaled flow conditions, indicating that the polymer scaffolds maintain functioning liver tissue. Further, histology sections of liver tissue grown on these polymer scaffolds show organization of cells into structures reminiscent of in vivo liver. The results of this study show that 3D-printed porous polymer scaffolds have great potential for use as biodegradable tissue culture support devices. It is believed that, combined with printing technologies now under development, the technologies developed in this thesis will help facilitate the construction of an implantable tissue engineered liver.

Development of such tools is especially important for a key subset of glycosaminoglycans, i.e., heparin/heparan sulfate-like glycosaminoglycans (HLGAGs). As a first step in the development of tools to study HLGAG structure, biochemical studies were completed on the heparinases, a family of three HLGAG-degrading enzymes from Flavobacterium heparinum. With heparinase I, it was found that calcium is a necessary cofactor for optimal activity and that two putative calcium coordinating motifs exist in heparinase I.

Current research has focused on developing such vehicles using end gene expression as the benchmark. While transgene protein production is the overall objective of successful gene delivery, such qualitative treatment of gene delivery, especially for non-viral vectors, may result in unoptimized vectors and potential rate limiting steps unidentified. Quantitative analysis of the gene delivery pathway is essential for the characterization, comparison, and design of vectors. The complex nature of the mechanisms for gene delivery, particularly at the cellular level, contains multiple potentially rate limiting steps to successful gene expression. Through quantitative methodologies, vector efficacy can be related to molecular characteristics and specific processes within the gene delivery pathway. These potentially rate limiting steps include, but are not limited to, cell surface association, subcellular trafficking, endosomal escape, nuclear translocation, vector unpackaging, and gene expression. Design of synthetic gene delivery vectors seeks to develop molecular systems mimicking virus-like infection behavior, including cell membrane attachment and rapid internalization followed by endosomal escape, nuclear localization, and finally gene expression. To explore such opportunities for vector optimization and design, a model human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line by sets of transfection agents complexed with a plasmid.

Current understanding of tissue differentiation mechanisms is based on studies of protein and RNAs that asymmetrically segregate between daughter cells during embryogenesis. Whether or not other types of biomolecules segregate asymmetrically has not been widely studied. In 1975, John Cairns proposed that ASCs preferentially segregate the oldest parental template DNA strands to themselves and pass on newly replicated DNA strands to their differentiating progeny in order to protect the stem cell from inheriting DNA replication mutations. This laboratory has shown non-random chromosome segregation in murine fetal fibroblasts that model asymmetric self-renewal like ASCs. In these cells, chromosomes that contain the oldest DNA strands co-segregate to the cycling daughter stem-like cells, while chromosomes with more recently replicated DNA segregate to the non-stem cell daughters. Previously, cytological methods were reported to elucidate non-random segregation in these cells. This dissertation research provides additional confirmation of the mechanism using physicochemical methods. Specifically, buoyant density-shift experiments in equilibrium CsCl density gradients were used to detect co-segregated \"immortal DNA strands\" based on incorporation of the thymidine base analogue bromodeoxyuridine. In addition, DNA from cells undergoing non-random mitotic chromosome segregation was analyzed for unique DNA base modifications and global structural modifications (by HPLC and melting temperature analyses). To date, these studies show no significant differences compared to control randomly segregated DNA. Components of the mitotic chromosome separation ",

Intracellular mechanosensors are thought to be activated by conformational changes induced by local cellular deformations. Since these mechanosensors have been speculated to be located in several cellular domains including the cell membrane, the cytoskeleton, and the nucleus, it is necessary to achieve a detailed understanding of subcellular mechanics. In this work, we present novel methods to independently quantify cytoskeletal displacements, mechanical coupling between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix, and nuclear mechanics based on high resolution tracking of cellular structures and receptor bound magnetic beads in response to applied strain or microscopic forces. These methods were applied to study the effects of several human disease associated mutations on subcellular mechanics and to examine the interaction between known protein function and specific changes in cellular mechanical properties and mechanotransduction pathways. Initial experiments were targeted to the role of membrane adhesion receptors. Experiments with cells expressing a mutant form of the integrin-associated molecule tetraspanin CD151 revealed that CD151 plays a key role in selectively strengthening α6βl integrin-mediated adhesion to laminin-1.

Studying hepatotoxicity in vitro is a challenging task because hepatocytes, the metabolically active cells of the liver, are very difficult to maintain in culture. After just 24 hours, the cells detach from the plate and die, and even if they survive they usually do not express the metabolic functions which they have in vivo. It has been observed by others that culturing hepatocytes between two layers of collagen type I maintains in vivo-like morphology and also many drug metabolizing enzymes for weeks. In spite of the research examining drug metabolism in collagen sandwiches, there are very few studies evaluating this system for investigating hepatotoxicity. We cultured primary rat hepatocytes in the collagen sandwich configuration and our goal was to optimize this system for long-term studies and to examine toxicity of a variety of hepatotoxins. By measuring secretions of urea and albumin, and P4501A activity, we determined the optimal cell density to be 50,000 cells/cm2. We also evaluated the need for epidermal growth factor (EGF) in our cultures, by comparing urea and albumin secretions in cultures grown with and without EGF. The cultures without EGF had significantly less secretion of both urea and albumin just two days after plating. Therefore, we decided to include EGF in the medium.

The highly orchestrated events that take place in the liver to maintain homeostasis require the presence of all liver cell types. In vivo experiments offer only a snapshot of the liver, and usually involve perturbation of normal function through injury or experimental disease. The role of cell-cell interactions in maintaining normal liver function is far less understood than in pathological conditions. This may be because of the lack of methods in monitoring normal function in vivo. Culturing systems may capture pieces of the puzzle, but often capture only two cell types, and involve mediators presented to the cells in concentrations much higher than physiological values. In addition, the liver lobule contains a 3-dimensional metabolic zonation, and liver cell types comprise a heterogeneous population from the portal triad where the blood flows into the sinusoids to the central vein area where the blood flows out of the sinusoids. Liver cell types are dynamic responders to environmental cues from soluble factors to heterotypic cell interactions, to extracellular matrix proteins. Therefore, a system that serves to promote the health of all liver cell types through a 3-dimensional, perfused scaffold, and allows for self-organization of the liver cells in response to the engineered environment, would serve as a useful tool in understanding some of these complex, orchestrated events. In the research presented here, methods were developed to detect and characterize the heterogeneous population that makes up the hepatic stellate cell population inside the liver bioreactor (Griffith et. al).

Adult stem cells (ASC), which play the prime role in the maintenance and restoration of tissues, are thought to hold great potential for the advancement of medicine. It has been postulated that adult stem cells are able to retain \"immortal\" DNA template strands over successive generations by non-random chromosome co-segregation, and in so doing, to protect the long-term genomic fidelity of whole tissue compartments. The investigation of this theory may yield insights into areas such as the development of cancer and the process of aging. In addition, it may lead to the discovery of an effective method for the unique identification of adult stem cells, the study of which has thus far suffered from the lack of unique identifiers. Thus, the goal of this research was to develop an assay for the detection of immortal DNA strand co-segregation that could be applied to the detection and analysis of adult stem cells. It is proposed that such an assay may in itself serve as a unique identification method for adult stem cells. In this thesis, the development of such an assay is described. This assay, referred to as the label release assay, has provided further evidence for the existence of immortal strand co-segregation in model cell lines, and will potentially be useful in the study of adult stem cells in tissues.

This polymer has the unique properties of being cell resistant and chemically versatile such that various cell ligands can be coupled to its side chains. These properties allow adhesion through specific cell receptors to be studied without the effect of background adhesion to adsorbed proteins. By taking advantage of the ability to target specific receptors the comb polymer could be used as a powerful sorting tool. Sorting could be accomplished by finding cell type specific adhesion ligands. Several possible such ligands were screened. A ligand containing the tripeptide sequence RGD was found to elicit a strong cell adhesion response. However, this ligand is adherent to many cell types of the liver and would not be suitable for sorting purposes. Other cell type specific ligands tested showed little to no affinity for liver cell adhesion.

Initial efforts have resulted in solid PGS-based scaffolds with biomimetic fluid flow and capillary channels on the order of 10 microns in width. These scaffolds have also been seeded with endothelial cells and perfused continuously in culture for up to 14 days resulting in partially confluent channels.

Epidemiological studies have shown a correlation between exposure to AFBI and incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Mutations in p53 are observed in over 50% of the HCC samples studied, and a unique mutational hotspot occurs at the third position of codon 249 in this gene, yielding almost exclusively GC to TA transversions. It is of interest to evaluate the mutagenic properties of specific chemical structures of AFBI adducts in order to determine which of these may be responsible for the mutations that may play a role in the formation of HCC.

Some of these observations are brought to the attention of public health officials in the hope that an environmental cause within these communities may be discovered and subsequently eliminated. However, what appears to be a cluster of cancer cases locally may be a chance occurrence when viewed from the perspective of the entire state or region. The primary aim of this work was to obtain and analyze a data set of sufficient magnitude to provide a means to discover if distributions of cancer mortality rates among communities within a particular state, for any of the most common forms of cancer, were compatible with chance. To this end cancer mortality data for six of the largest states in the United States (California, Florida, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas) were collected, converted into mortality rates and analyzed to discover if the variations among communities could be accounted for by chance alone. These data comprised one third of all recorded deaths in the period of approximately 1969 to 1998. The 21 most common forms of adult and 6 most common forms of pediatric cancers were organized to permit analyses within each of the 6 states with regard to age (0-19, 65-84 and >/= 85 years), gender and ethnicity (European American and Non-European American descent). Key to this work was the mode of statistical analysis. For each community an expected mortality rate and its expected distribution was defined by the average mortality rate for all communities within each state and the binomial distribution, respectively. These expected distributions were summed for all communities to define the expected chance distribution of community mortality rates for each state, cancer, gender, age cohort and ethnicity. This produced nearly 800 separate \"chance\" distributions. Each of these was compared to the corresponding observed distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smimov statistical test. This test was designed to discover statistically significant differences between any two distributions. Here it was used to determine which of the nearly 800 observed distributions could not be accounted for by chance alone. Of these comparisons, 16 were found to have observed distributions significantly different from the expected by chance distributions. All 16 had distributions that exhibited greater dispersion than expected by chance, and none had distributions with less dispersion than the chance expectation. ",

The specificity involved in the HSGAG-protein interactions stems from the structural heterogeneity of HSGAGs, which are highly acidic biopolymers associated on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix. It is believed that structural specificity in the HSGAG-protein interactions determines the biological functions mediated by HSGAG-binding proteins such as basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2). A number of models have been proposed to account for the mode of FGF-FGFR interactions and the role of HSGAGs in modulating FGF2 signaling. It was hypothesized that one role played by HSGAGs was to stabilize FGF2 oligomers in a \"side-by-side\" or cis fashion for presentation to fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR). In this thesis research, we systematically examined different proposed modes of FGF2 dimerization and showed that extensive oligomerization of a FGF2 mutant protein could be achieved by oxidatively crosslinking. Heparin, a highly sulfated form of HSGAGs, was demonstrated to increase the extent of oligomerization. Therefore, the results reported here were consistent with the hypothesis that HSGAGs promoted FGF2 oligomerization in a \"side-by-side\" mode. The functional significance of a FGF2 dimer was tested using a genetically engineered dimeric FGF2 (dFGF2).

The same complexity that contributes to the diversity of GAG function has also hindered their chemical characterization. Recent progress in coupling bacterial GAG-degrading enzymes with sensitive analytical techniques has led to a revolution in understanding the structure-function relationship for an important subset of GAGs, namely heparin/heparan sulfate-like glycosaminoglycans (HSGAGs). The study of chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate (CS/DS), an equally important subset of GAGs, has lagged behind partially due to a lack of enzymatic and analytical tools akin to those developed for HSGAGs. The Flavobacterial heparinases have proven indispensable in characterizing the fine structure of HSGAGs responsible for their different biological functions. As a continuation of ongoing research, a combination of chemical modification, peptide mapping, and site-directed mutagenesis was employed to explore the role of histidine in the activity of heparinase III. Of the thirteen histidines in the enzyme, His295 and His510 were found to be critical for the degradation of heparan sulfate by heparinase III. As a first step to developing the chondroitinases as enzymatic tools for the characterization of CS/DS oligosaccharides, recombinant expression and purification schemes were developed for chondroitinase AC and B from Flactobacterium heparinum. The recombinant enzymes were characterized using biochemical techniques and kinetic parameters were determined for their respective CS/DS substrates. ",

Both classes of molecules have diverse roles in normal and pathological processes including development, cell growth, wound healing, angiogenesis, viral entry, and cancer. Taking advantage of the ability of carbohydrates to affect biological outcomes, several companies have already begun developing sugar-based structures as therapeutics for malaria and breast cancer, among others. However, the structural complexity that allows HSGAGs and N-glycans to exhibit such a wide array of activities also makes them more difficult to study than their protein and nucleotide counterparts. There are currently no effective methods for rapid synthesis of specific HSGAG or N-glycan structures, and until recently, most common analytical techniques were not useful in this field due to sensitivity constraints. Now, with advances in separation techniques and mass spectrometry, the fundamental roles of biological carbohydrates can be elucidated more efficiently. However, there is still a need for improved methodologies for studying these classes of molecules. This thesis describes the development of a novel technique for the direct isolation and sequencing of protein-binding HSGAG oligosaccharides. As a proof-of-concept, we used heparin and HSGAG-binding proteins of known specificity (fibroblast growth factor and antithrombin III), then utilized the technique to identify an oligosaccharide binder for a protein with unknown HSGAG binding specificity (endostatin).

These threats to the genetic integrity of cells are caused by exogenous and endogenous oxidizing agents and may contribute to diseases such as cancer. To better understand the role of oxidative DNA damage in these diseases, it is necessary to quantify deoxyribose oxidation both in vitro and in vivo. Current methods lack the sensitivity required to measure low concentrations of deoxyribose oxidation products. The goals of the research findings reported here is to develop a sensitive method that can accurately and reproducibly quantify 3'-phosphoglycolaldehyde (PGA), one example of a deoxyribose oxidation product, and to apply the method to quantify PGA in vitro and in cells. Given the presence of reactive carbonyl groups in many deoxyribose oxidation products, the method should be widely applicable to other studies of oxidative ])NA damage. The analytical method exploits the reactive carbonyl moiety in PGA by derivatization as a stable oxime with pentafluorobenzylhydroxylamine, followed by solvent extraction and gas chromatography/negative chemical ionization/mass spectrometry. A stable isotopically-labeled [13C2]-PGA is synthesized and used as an internal standard. The method is linear in response over the range of 30 fmol to 300 pmol and precision is verified by analysis of a synthetic, PGA-containing oligodeoxynucleotide. The limit of detection in the presence of DNA is 30 fmol of PGA. The analytical method was then applied to the quantification of PGA in purified DNA and cultured cells treated with several oxidants.

This work consists of an investigation into two possible methods for determining the role of genes involved in the DNA and cellular damage response, though the methods are generally applicable to investigating a wide variety of biological pathways and responses. A library of approximately 4,800 yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) deletion strains produced by the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project and consisting essentially of all possible mutants having one non-essential gene deleted (and replaced with unique identification tags called \"bar codes\") from the genome are employed in this endeavor. The methods focus on gathering phenotype data in a high-throughput manner and in response to the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). The first method makes use of a new technology called the Living ChipTM, which can hold libraries of compounds or cell cultures in an array of 50-nl channels and which could ideally accommodate all deletion strains on a single array. The second method involves pooling all strains together in a single culture and allowing them to grow competitively to determine their relative fitness based on a specific treatment. ",

These cells come from the pre-implantation embryo, whose native environment is the hypoxic mammalian reproductive tract. Growing stem cells in an environment with higher oxygen levels (i.e. the atmospheric oxygen levels that are normally used to cultivate stem cells) could be bad for the cells, as oxygen is toxic due to its powerful oxidative capacity. In this experiment, J1 murine embryonic stem cells were grown at 0%, 2%, 5%, 10%, and 20% oxygen by volume to assess the effects that lower oxygen levels have on stem cell growth, plating efficiency, and metabolism. Two reaction vessels were built so that the cells could be grown in a controlled environment. Premixed gas cylinders were used to flush the vessels and an optical probe was used to measure the headspace oxygen concentration. Cells were found to grow faster than atmospheric conditions when in a moderately hypoxic environment where the oxygen concentration was between 2% and 10%, and considerably slower than atmospheric conditions as the headspace oxygen concentration approached zero. Maximum cell density decreased, glucose-lactate yield increased, glucose-cell yield decreased, and glutamine-cell yield decreased as headspace oxygen decreased. There were no strong correlations between oxygen concentration and glutamine-ammonia yield or plating efficiency. From the results of this study, it appears that it may be preferable to grow murine embryonic stem cells in a moderately hypoxic environment around 10% oxygen to increase the growth rate while minimizing the maximum cell density and metabolic inefficiency compromises.

In this research, an ES cell line with transfected green fluorescent protein (GFP) co-expressed by an Oct-4 promoter was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) to obtain such profile. As Oct-4 is an ES cell differentiation marker whose expression varies with pluripotency, GFP expression could simply be measured in these cells to determine how pluripotent they are as a population. The differentiation characterization of ES cells was also conducted with different culture conditions of reduced serum and glucose concentrations both in the presence and absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) which prevents spontaneous differentiation, as well as at varied LIF concentrations and seeding densities. In addition, fundamental growth kinetic and metabolic profiles were obtained to get a more complete picture of how ES cells behave under these varied culturing conditions. The doubling time (t[sub]d) of R1 Oct4-GFP cell line was found to be 13 hours in LIF⁺ culture and 8 hours in culture with LIF addition after 7 days of LIF withdrawal, implying that cell proliferation rate is higher for cells receiving a sudden upregulation of genes controlling cell division through LIF addition. Although the upregulation of the genes is rapid, the downregulation of these genes through LIF withdrawal was found to take 6-7 days, while 3-4 days were required to downregulate the pou5f gene (which controls Oct4 expression).

As a complement to the LC-MS method for the quantification of nucleobase deamination products, enzymatic probes were also developed for oxidative and nitrosative DNA lesions. These probes would not only allow differential quantification of the two types of DNA damage, but would also allow the lesions to be mapped in any DNA sequence by coupling their activity with the technique of ligation-mediated PCR. As an extension of the biomarker study, the effects of ONOO⁻ dose and dose-rate on the DNA damage and mutations induced in the supF gene were investigated. The observations suggest that both the dose and dose-rate at which a genetic target is exposed to ONOO⁻ substantially influence the damage and mutational response and these parameters will need to be considered in assessing the potential effects of ONOO⁻ in vivo.

However, numerous studies have revealed important differences between TIMP family members in their ability to inhibit angiogenic processes in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo despite their universal ability to inhibit matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity. To address these differences, structure-function studies were conducted to identify and characterize the anti-angiogenic domains of TIMP-2, the endogenous MMP inhibitor that uniquely inhibits capillary endothelial cell (EC) proliferation and angiogenesis in vivo. Only the carboxy-terminal domain of TIMP-2 (T2C) and not the MMP-inhibitory N-terminal domain (T2N), inhibited capillary EC proliferation. Although both T2N and T2C inhibited embryonic angiogenesis, only T2C potently inhibited mitogen-stimulated angiogenesis. These findings demonstrate that TIMP-2 possesses two distinct types of anti-angiogenic activities which can be uncoupled from each other. The anti-proliferative activity of T2C was further mapped to the 24-amino acid peptide, Loop 6, which proved to be a potent inhibitor of both embryonic and nitogen-stimulated angiogenesis in vivo. Initial studies into the mechanism(s) by which Loop 6 inhibits angiogenesis revealed that the anti-proliferative effects of Loop 6 are due, at least in part, to the inhibition of cell cycle progression and not to the induction of apoptosis.

The chondrocyte-seeded peptide hydrogel was then evaluated cellular activities in vitro under standard culture conditions and also when subjected to dynamic compression.

Therefore it is important to understand the specificity of glycan-protein interactions and how these specific interactions influence their structure-function relationships. This thesis addresses many challenges in this emerging area of glycomics, by taking an integrated approach that couples biophysical and biochemical methods with a bioinformatics framework to represent and process sequence information content in GAGs. With this motivation the thesis is divided into 4 components 1. Using heparin/heparan sulfate GAGs (HSGAGs) - fibroblast growth factor (FGF) as a model GAG-protein system, the first part focuses on determining the structural basis of FGF oligomerization, sequence specific FGF-HSGAG interactions and FGF-receptor (FGFR) interactions which collectively influence the specificity of HSGAG mediated FGF signaling. 2.

Due to a lack of effective tools to study structure-function relationship of these complex molecules, the role(s) of HLGAGs in cancer remains largely indirect and poorly understood. To study the role(s) of HLGAGs in cancer growth, metastasis and angiogenesis, tumor systems were studied using heparinases I and III which have distinct substrate specificities. Studies, focusing on the biochemistry of the heparinase active site, elucidated key interactions important for enzymatic activities, thus enabling the biological studies presented here. In vitro cell culture study with heparinases as tools clearly showed that cell surface HLGAGs are involved in regulating fundamental cellular activities including cell proliferation, invasion and adhesion. Significantly, heparinase I and III demonstrated distinct effect on these cellular activities with heparinase III inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, invasion and adhesion in selected model systems and heparinase I inhibiting these processes. Further in vivo studies in animal tumor models confirmed and expanded the distinct responses to heparinase I and III treatment. HLGAG fragments generated from heparinase treatment were found to be responsible for the effect of heparinase treatment in tumor models. Moreover, cell surface HLGAGs containing cryptic activatory and inhibitory sequence information were identified and characterized. In contrast to heparinase I- generated HLGAG fragments, heparinase III- generated HLGAG fragments were shown here to inhibit both primary tumor growth and secondary lung metastasis. ",

In this Thesis, we investigate affinity maturation of antibodies for very high affinity binding. Two single chain antigen-binding fragment (scFv) antibody systems that were engineered to obtain higher affinity interactions through directed evolution were probed using biophysical techniques to illuminate affinity modulation in proteins.

Much work has been done to study the role of inflammation in carcinogenesis. One hypothesis suggests that inflammation causes oxidative stress that induces damage to cellular targets, including DNA. The multistep model of cancer proposes that cancer is a genetic disease in which mutations are required in carcinogenesis. When this theory was championed, research focused on somatic mutations. The focus has broadened to include epigenetic mechanisms in changing gene expression. The association between chronic infection, chronic inflammation and increased cancer risk has been supported by epidemiologic studies. Data link chronic inflammation associated with infectious disease to increased cancer risk. Some examples of such infectious agents include hepatitis B virus, Schistosoma haemotobium, and Helicobacter pylori. One objective of this thesis was to investigate the role of inflammation in self-limiting infection. Additional objectives focus on evaluating a novel model of intestinal and extraintestinal cancer, and using immune regulating cells as treatment for intestinal cancer.

Increased mutant frequency was observed in association with elevated levels of iNOS 13 days post infection. The second aim, to characterize a novel model of neoplasia, led to the discovery of basosquamous cancer in mice with intestinal tumors.

While the collagen network mainly provides resistance to tensile and shear deformation, aggrecan enmeshed within this network contributes significantly to the tissue's compressive and shear properties under equilibrium as well as dynamic loading conditions. Aggrecan has a \"bottle-brush\" structure that includes -100 negatively charged chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan (CS-GAG) chains attached covalently to a core protein. Electrostatic interactions between these GAGs contribute to the compressive and shear stiffness of the tissue. Variations in the structure of aggrecan and its GAG constituents are known to exist as a function of tissue age, disease, and species. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we directly visualized the nanometer scale structure of aggrecan deposited on a 2-D substrate, including the first high resolution imaging of individual GAG chains along the core protein. We also visualized and quantified the differences in structure between aggrecan obtained from fetal epiphyseal and mature nasal bovine cartilages. ",

Numerous other processes have tried and accomplished this by non-specific protein adsorption, covalent attachment, biomolecule entanglement, and synthesis of new polymers with the desired functionality. The focus of this work is to modify the polymer's binding capability to cells while not altering the bulk properties. Through the use of both phage display of peptide libraries and yeast surface display of scFv libraries the surface of chlorine-doped polypyrrole (PPyCl) has been modified to facilitate binding of neuronal phenotype cells. The selection of peptides using phage display found a surface specific recognition peptide (T59) that was made bivalent by altering the C-terminus with an integrin binding epitope. The bivalency of the modified T59 peptide was exploited to tether phenochromocytoma (PC12) cells to the surface of PPyCl. Furthermore the tethering of the cells to PPyCl through the peptide does not decrease the cells neuronal function and maintains the bulk conductive polymers characteristics. Using the peptide as a bivalent linker, the addition of other types of cells, drugs, growth factors, and enzymes could be incorporated for various biomedical applications. ",

We used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching combined with intravital microscopy to quantitate the transport properties of the tumor interstitium. We found that the presence of fibrillar collagen correlated with hindered diffusion in vivo, and also in vitro, in collagen gels prepared to mimic tumor extracellular matrix. Modification of the tumor collagen matrix directly with purified bacterial collagenase, or indirectly with relaxin treatment, resulted in increased diffusion coefficients of macromolecules within tumors in vivo. In order to quantitate the changes in collagen content and structure induced by relaxin treatment, we adapted and further developed the imaging technique of intravital second harmonic generation microscopy. Using second harmonic generation imaging in combination with a fluorescently labeled gene therapeutic vector, we demonstrated that the spread of these viral vectors within tumors is limited by the fibrillar collagen in the extracellular matrix. Matrix modification via the introduction of bacterial collagenase along with the initial virus injection resulted in a significant improvement in the range of viral distribution within the tumor. ",

Although the mechanism by which injury leads to joint degeneration remains to be elucidated, several injury-related factors may contribute to the development of OA. These factors include but are not limited to altered mechanical loading and initiation of a cellular response in cartilage or other joint tissues at the time of the injury. Three in vitro models of joint injury were investigated to separately evaluate the effects on cartilage of mechanical overloading and damage to joint capsule and synovial lining. Models of injury included (1) mechanical injury lto cartilage explants alone, (2) co-culture of normal cartilage explants with an excised specimen of joint capsule tissue, and (3) co-culture of mechanically injured cartilage explants with excised joint capsule tissue. These models have been shown previously to result in matrix damage and decreased biosynthesis by the chondrocytes. We measured gene expression levels of matrix molecules and matrix proteases and found them to be expressed in control cartilage at levels ranging over five orders of magnitude, and to be differentially regulated in these three models of joint injury.

To control cell migration and to restrict cell or colony size, cells and proteins were patterned by using molding or printing methods. Poly(ethylene glycol)-based molecules and polysaccharides were used to control cell-substrate interactions and to prevent cell adhesion on specific regions of a substrate. To control cell-cell contact, layer-by-layer deposition of ionic biopolymers (i.e. negatively charged hyaluronic acid and positively charged poly-L-lysine) was used to generate patterned co-cultures. In addition, to control cell-soluble factor interactions, microfluidic-based approaches were developed.

This question has drawn considerable interest since 1972, when it was first discovered that cells have an intrinsic ability to self-destruct through a process called apoptosis. Since then, apoptosis has been shown to play a critical role in both normal physiology and disease. In addition, many of the basic molecular mechanisms that control apoptosis have been revealed. Yet despite the known list of interactions and regulators, it remains difficult to inspect the network of apoptosis-related proteins and predict how cells will behave. The challenge is even greater when one considers interactions with other networks that are anti-apoptotic, such as growth-factor networks. In this thesis, we develop an approach to measure, analyze, and predict how complex intracellular signaling networks transduce extracellular stimuli into cellular fates. This approach entails three interrelated aims: 1) to develop high-throughput, quantitative techniques that measure key nodes in the intracellular network; 2) to characterize the quantitative changes in network state and cell behavior by exposing cells to diverse fate-changing stimuli; and 3) to use data-driven modeling approaches that analyze large signaling-response datasets to suggest new biological hypotheses.

Alterations in the biosynthesis of this molecule over time could impact the ability of the tissue to perform its necessary functions. Several factors have been shown to alter the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate in cartilage; among them are age, disease, depth of tissue, and mechanical compression. Specifically, mechanical compression has been shown to have a significant effect on the sulfation pattern and chain length and number in cartilage explant studies. The mechanisms that govern these alterations, however, have not been determined. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of mechanical compression on chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis and analyze the roles of two possible mechanisms; enzyme transcription and organelle deformation. The effects of mechanical compression on the transcription rates of enzymes associated with the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate have not been previously studied. To perform this study in a bovine model, portions of the bovine genome had to be sequenced, PCR primers designed, and bulk expression levels determined. Static compression resulted in the significant up-regulation of two genes of interest: chondroitin sulfate and GalNAc 4S,6-sulfotransferase. ",

Mathematical models in terms of these parameters' effects and their interactions were proposed for each of the responses. The significance of each effect and interaction, as well as the goodness-of-fit of mathematical models to data were examined by analysis of variance. It was found that biomass (with R²Adj=0.951) is a strong function of glycerol concentration (higher glycerol concentration leads to higher biomass), but it varies much less with agitation, and it is completely independent of salt concentration. Growth rate (R²Adj=0.901), however, varies strongly with agitation and salt concentration, but much more weakly with glycerol concentration. Protein production has a low R²Adj value of 0.746, implying that higher-order terms, e.g. x₁² and x₂², should be tested for significance in the model. ",

The experimental setup involved stimulating human colorectal cancer cells, HT-29 and HCT- 116, and human prostate cancer cells, LNCaP, with cytokines in order to induce cell death. Then, we observed the effects of NO inhibitors, kinase inhibitors, and activation of Akt, a kinase up-stream of the caspase cascade, following transfection of a DNA sequence that was proven to protect cells against apoptosis induction. In our series of experiments, inhibition of the nitric oxide synthases removes nitric oxide protection from apoptosis, but inhibition of only the inducible synthase has opposite effects with prostate and colon cancer cells that are considered insignificant, and its effects on the two types of colon cancer cells are in discord. Transformation and transfection of ARK5 into the colorectal cancer cell line, HT-29 did not prove beneficial. Similarly, glucosamine showed no clear pattern of reducing apoptosis in the cells. Therefore, we propose further exploration of the inhibition of constitutive nitric oxide synthases as a potential therapy. ",

However, these applications are limited because of the difficulty in isolating and expanding pure populations of adult stem cells (ASCs). A major barrier to ASC expansion in vitro is their property of asymmetric cell kinetics. Our lab has developed a method, Suppression of Asymmetric Cell Kinetics (SACK), to expand ASCs in vitro by shifting their cell kinetics program from asymmetric to symmetric. We have found that guanine nucleotide precursors can be used to convert the kinetics of adult stem cells from asymmetric to symmetric, which promotes their exponential expansion. Previously, we have used the SACK method to derive hepatic and cholangiocyte stem cell strains from adult rat livers in vitro. These cell strains provide an assay to evaluate whether growth factors and cytokines previously implicated in proliferation of progenitor cells act by converting the kinetics of the stem cells in the population from asymmetric to symmetric, and thus identify new SACK agents.

With the recent and progressive emergence of biochemical and analytical tools to probe GAG structure and function, efforts can be taken to understand the role of GAGs in cell biology and in disease in the various physiological locations where GAGs can exist. As a first step to probe the functions of GAGs, the heparin/heparan sulfate-GAG (HSGAG)-fibroblast growth factor (FGF) system was examined. Understanding the role of HSGAGs in inducing FGF2 dimerization led to the development of a novel engineered protein that was found to be effective at promoting functional recovery in stroke. Subsequently, methods to isolate HSGAGs from the cell surface were optimized and the ability of HSGAGs to support FGF signaling was investigated. Cell surface HSGAGs can define the responsiveness of a given cell to FGF1 and FGF2 through multiple receptor isoforms. Stromal cell derived HSGAGs were also identified as critical regulators of tumor cell growth and metastasis, effecting not only FGF2., but also 1-integrin signaling. ",

Hepatocyte adhesion environments were examined in two settings: spheroid culture prior to seeding in the bioreactor and 2D surface culture methods that could be applied to the bioreactor scaffold. Spheroids were formed either by culturing in spinning suspension or on a static, non-adherent surface. In spheroid culture, the addition of extracellular matrix (ECM) signaling through the use of soluble Matrigel or adhesion protein-coated microspheres did not improve hepatocyte viability or function as assessed by liver-specific gene expression. These results suggest the importance of cell-cell rather than cell-surface interactions in maintaining hepatocytes.

Anti-angiogenics alone have not proven effective in inducing tumor regression in the clinic due to both the cytostatic nature of anti-angiogenic therapy and the potential formation of new regions of hypoxia within the tumor after therapy. The new therapeutic paradigm is for combining both anti-angiogenics and traditional cytotoxic agents for a synergistic effect. The efficacy of cytotoxic agents may be reduced after anti-angiogenic therapy, however, due to limited access to tumor vasculature and hypoxia-induced drug resistance. We propose that loading cytotoxic agents within the tumor prior to blood vessel collapse will enable both greater drug accumulation within the tumor as well as a reduction in the formation of therapy-induced regions of hypoxia. We present here a novel nanodelivery vehicle termed a 'nanocell' for the spatio-temporal recruitment of both anti-angiogenics and cytotoxic agents within the solid tumor to achieve this goal.

However, this hypothesis has not been tested by an assay of nuclear point mutations in lungs of smokers and nonsmokers. Mismatch amplification mutation assay (MAMA), an effective form of allele-specific PCR, was applied for detection of point mutations in TP53 bp742, bp746 and bp747, K-ras bp35 and HPRT bp508 from a total of 291 tracheal-bronchial epithelial sectors from six smokers and nine non-smokers, yielding 949 individual mutational assays.

Thesis for this research was that the study of asymmetric self-renewal, a defining property of ASCs, might provide key clues to understanding ASC function and lead to discovery of novel molecular markers for ASCs. Fifty two self-renewal pattern associated (SRPA) genes were identified by cDNA microarray analysis with cell culture models whose self-renewal pattern could be reversibly regulated, instead of using heterogeneous ASC-enriched populations. From evaluation of whole genome transcript levels to expand the SRPA gene pool, 543 SRPA genes were discovered. Both microarray studies showed that asymmetric self-renewal associated (ASRA) genes were highly represented in ASC-enriched populations but not in embryonic stem cells. The SRPA gene expression signature successfully distinguished isolated ASC-enriched populations from non-stem cell populations by principal component analysis (PCA). ",

    "text": "Mechanical injury and inflammatory cytokines affect cartilage integrity and tissue homeostasis : a mass spectrometric analysis of proteins with relevance to arthritis Osteoarthritis is characterized by synovial joint degeneration, and its cardinal pathological feature is degeneration and loss of the articular cartilage joint surface. While the aetiology of osteoarthritis is unknown, risk factors include gender, age, obesity, and prior joint injury. Joint injuries, including tears of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and meniscus, increase the risk for the development of OA and involve both mechanical damage to cartilage, meniscus and synovial tissues, and tissue degradation associated with cytokine-induced inflammation. While the role of inflammatory cytokines in OA is still controversial, their role in rheumatoid arthritis is evidenced by the successful use of anti-TNF-ca and anti-IL-1 therapies to abrogate disease symptoms and progression. In vitro, both IL-13 and TNF-ca promote chondrocyte-mediated matrix degradation and inhibit cartilage matrix synthesis, while mechanical damage causes cell death, matrix damage, and decreased cell biosynthesis. Understanding the similarities and differences in cartilage responses to inflammatory cytokines and mechanical injury is important in understanding the catabolic-anabolic shifts that typify OA progression. Therefore, the objectives of this thesis were (1) to identify the role of TNF-a and IL-1 induced nitric oxide (NO) as a mediator of cartilage tissue damage; ",

We have developed a model immunization system designed to allow these steps in the DC life cycle to be controlled in the context of a subunit vaccine. The system is comprised of microspheres encapsulating chemokines and hydrogel nanoparticles; each nanoparticle contains antigen and DC maturation signals (e.g., TLR ligands). The nanoparticles remain sequestered within the carrier microspheres but the chemokine is released at a controllable rate, creating a local chemoattractant gradient centered on each microsphere. DCs are attracted to individual microspheres where nanoparticles are concentrated; attracted DCs extract nanoparticles from the carrier microspheres, and receive maturation signals coincident with the delivery of antigen into both class I and class II MHC processing pathways.

Many envisioned applications of CTP, such as treating large defects in bone, involve in vivo implantation of CTP attached to a scaffold, a process that creates an acute inflammatory environment that may be hostile to CTP survival. This project entails the design of a two-component polymeric implant system to aid in the healing process of bony defects by influencing cell behaviors at the implant site through the covalent modification of the implant surface with selected ligands. We investigate cellular responses of CTP on a biomaterial surface covalently modified with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and find that surface-tethered EGF (tEGF) promotes both cell spreading and survival more strongly than saturating concentrations of soluble EGF. By sustaining MEK-ERK signaling, tEGF increases the contact of CTP with an otherwise moderately adhesive synthetic polymer and confers resistance to apoptosis induced by the proinflammatory cytokine, FasL.

Also, deformation above a threshold stimulus results in neutrophil activation, evidenced by pseudopod projection from the cell. These two events are thought to occur via independent pathways, yet little is known about the mechanosensing signaling involved. Other work has demonstrated that physiological deformation of neutrophils induces a marked increase in the levels of cytosolic calcium, suggesting that this occurrence may trigger the biomechanical response observed in the cell.

The desire is to differentiate among diseased and healthy cells, cell age, and cell type with the minimum amount of sample pretreatment. This project addresses this need by developing microfluidic devices that exploit the adhesion differences between cell states and cell types to rapidly count cells of different types without the need for labels. There are two avenues in which to explore cell adhesion differences with these devices, the first is a net electrostatic change at the surface of the cell wall and the second is the presence of specific cell-membrane adhesion proteins. It is hypothesized that the forced interaction of the cell wall with the microfabricated microcapillary walls would result in a differential velocity based on cell type that could be detected simply using a microscope and video camera or an interferometer. The eventual integration of cell velocity detection would result in a portable all-inclusive lab-on-a-chip system that could be used in the field for detecting the presence of diseases, such as malaria and cancer as well as in a lab setting for drug discovery.

However, the design principles governing the construction and operation of these networks remain mostly unknown. To discover design principles in these networks, we investigated and developed a set of computational tools described below. First, we looked into the application of optimization techniques to explore network topology, parameterization, or both, and to evaluate relative fitness of networks operational strategies. In particular, we studied the ability of an enzymatic cycle to produce dynamic properties such as responsiveness and transient noise filtering. We discovered that non-linearity of the enzymatic cycle allows more effective filtering of transient noise. Furthermore, we found that networks with multiple activation steps, despite being less responsive, are better in filtering transient noise. Second, we explored a method to construct compact models of signal transduction networks based on a protein-domain network representation. This method generates models whose number of species, in the worst case, scales quadratically to the number of protein-domain sites and modification states, a tremendous saving over the combinatorial scaling in the more standard mass-action model was estimated to consist of more that 10⁷ species and was too large to simulate; however, a simplified model consists of only 132 state variables and produced intuitive behavior. The resulting models were utilized to study the roles of a scaffold protein and of a shared binding domain to pathway functions. ",

Because S. cerevisiae screens for enhanced protein secretion have traditionally utilized low-throughput and often plate-based methods, a high-throughput, liquid phase assay could offer a real advantage in secretory selection. In this thesis, yeast surface display is investigated as a potential proxy for heterologous protein secretion. Although ultimately unsuitable as a screening proxy, the surface display experiments did show a novel method of improving protein secretion by co-expressing a more stably folded protein with the protein of interest.

To date, no robust, efficient method for the pure, ex vivo expansion of human HSCs has been demonstrated. Previous methods primarily induced the expansion of committed hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), yielding even less pure populations of HSCs. This research was based on the hypothesis that, like for other adult stem cells (ASCs), the major barrier to expanding HSCs ex vivo is in preferentially regulating the asymmetric self-renewal of HSCs without loss in their ability to produce differentiated committed HPCs. This laboratory has shown that a p53-dependent pathway specifically controls the self-renewal pattern of several types of ASCs and thereby provides an effective means for expansion of ASCs in culture. The method, which involves the use of purine metabolites to achieve suppression of asymmetric cell kinetics, is referred to as SACK. The utility of the p53-dependent pathway was investigated for directing expansion of human HSCs. In order to support this investigation, the proliferation of HPCs in in vitro cultures was repressed by culturing cells without hematopoietic growth factors and cytokines. ",

Few tools are currently available for scientists to quantitatively examine these vector-to-cell interactions or determine the rate limiting steps within the gene delivery pathway. Thus, researchers cannot fully optimize the vector design to reach maximal delivery efficiency. This project seeks to address this issue by modifying a density gradient electrophoresis (DGE) device originally developed on Mel Juso cells to segregate primary rat hepatocyte lysate into nuclear, early endosomal, late endosomal/lysosomal, and cytoplasmic fractions. We found that according to the Horseradish Peroxidase assay, late endosomes and lysosomes consistently localize to fractions 11-13 and early endosomes in fractions 18 to 21. There was minimal labeling in fractions 14 through 17 demonstrating that separation of the organelles was achieved.

However, the lethal effects of these wavelengths limited their usefulness in studies of cell function, separating the contributions of protein and nucleic acid proved difficult, and scattering artifacts were a significant concern.

First, electrostatic analysis of a series of small molecule neuraminidase inhibitors was used to demonstrate that charge optimization improves the electrostatic component of the binding free energy, despite changes in binding mode and discrete chemical constraints. Additionally, chemical changes suggested by charge optimization frequently corresponded to tighter-binding inhibitors, indicating that this technique would be useful for the design of future inhibitors. Second, computational sequence and structure analysis were used to study the PDZ3-CRIPT binding interaction and a method for sequence analysis was developed to locate residues important for binding specificity. Third, computational analysis of the horseradish peroxidase active site suggested five positions as candidates for mutation, and further studies of new mutant enzymes let to ideas for the improvement of computational enzyme design procedures. Finally, both computational protein design techniques and a model of the evolutionary process were used to study the efficiency of evolution as a tool for creating new proteins in the laboratory.

We hypothesized that recreating a liver tissue system that captured in vivo like paracrine influences would foster survival of these cells, and predicted that stimuli resulting from flow and oxygen gradients close to physiological conditions would preserve the delicate balance between the cell types.

Micro-flow rates of different media through the formed tissue units in scaffolds were controlled using pneumatic pumps and microfluidics. Staining and confocal imaging of endpoint tissue showed that lower flow rates closer to physiological regimes allowed the survival of SE-1+ SECs, regardless of exogenously added growth factors in the medium. Higher flow rates, exogenous growth factors, and scaffold contact were associated with activation of stellate cells (alpha-smooth muscle actin staining). ",

    "text": "Analysis of the structural changes caused by positive DNA supercoiling The procession of helix-tracking enzymes along a DNA molecule results in the formation of supercoils in the DNA, with positive supercoiling (overwinding) generated ahead of the enzyme, and negative supercoiling (underwinding) in its wake. While the structural and physiological consequences of negative supercoiling have been well studied, technical challenges have prevented extensive examination of positively supercoiled DNA. Studies suggest that at sufficiently high levels of overwinding, DNA relieves strain by adopting an elongated structure, where the bases are positioned extrahelically and the backbones occupy the center of the helix. This transition has only been identified, however, at a degree of supercoiling substantially higher than is generated physiologically. To examine the structural changes resulting from physiological levels of positive DNA supercoiling, I have developed a method for preparing highly purified positively supercoiled plasmid substrates. Based on a method previously developed in this laboratory, this allows for preparation of large quantities of very pure, highly positively supercoiled plasmid. It also expands on earlier methods by exploiting ionic strength to modulate the direction of supercoiling introduced, allowing preparation of either positively or negatively supercoiled substrates.

    "text": "Inherited risk for common disease Linkage disequilibrium studies have discovered few gene-disease associations for common diseases. The explanation has been offered that complex modes of inheritance govern risk for cancers, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and diabetes. Such studies, however, depended on the untested assumption of monoallelic risk. My research advisor and I set out to investigate whether simple forms of inherited risk, monoallelic or multiallelic, could be excluded by analysis of familial risk for a common disease, such as colorectal cancer (CRC). First, we derived formulae that describe the risk for monogenic, multigenic, and polygenic possibilities of Mendelian inheritance. Next, we obtained an estimate of minimum lifetime risk for CRC of >0.26. Then, we examined the case of late-onset CRC, using the Swedish Family Cancer Database (1958-2002) to estimate the familial relative risk for CRC diagnosis at age 50 or older, and obtained an estimated range of 1.5 to 3.0. We compared this range of actual values to the ranges of expected values for monogenic, multigenic, and polygenic modes of inheritance. ",

    "text": "Quantitative studies of EGFR autocrine induced cell signaling and migration Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor autocrine and/or paracrine signaling plays an important role in normal epithelial cell proliferation, survival, adhesion and migration. Aberrant expression of the EGF receptor and its cognate ligands have been implicated in various types of cancers, hence EGF receptor autocrine activation is thought to also be involved in tumorigenesis. EGF family ligands are synthesized as membrane-anchored proteins requiring proteolytic release to form the mature soluble, receptor-binding factor. Despite the pathophysiological importance of autocrine systems, how protease-mediated ligand release quantitatively influences receptor-mediated signaling and consequent cell behavior is poorly understood. Therefore, we explored the relationship between autocrine EGF release rate and receptor-mediated ERK activation and migration in human mammary epithelial cells. A quantitative spectrum of EGF release rates was achieved using chimeric EGF ligand precursors modulated by the addition of the metalloprotease inhibitor batimastat. We found that ERK activation increased with increasing ligand release rates despite concomitant EGF receptor downregulation. ",

    "text": "Simulation, models, and refactoring of bacteriophage T7 gene expression Our understanding of why biological systems are designed in a particular way would benefit from biophysically-realistic models that can make accurate predictions on the time-evolution of molecular events given arbitrary arrangements of genetic components. This thesis is focused on constructing such models for gene expression during bacteriophage T7 infection. T7 gene expression is a particularly well suited model system because knowledge of how the phage functions is thought to be relatively complete. My work focuses on two questions in particular. First, can we address deficiencies in past simulations and measurements of bacteriophage T7 to improve models of gene expression? Second, can we design and build refactored surrogates of T7 that are easier to understand and model? To address deficiencies in past simulations and measurements, I developed a new single-molecule, base-pair-resolved gene expression simulator named Tabasco that can faithfully represent mechanisms thought to govern phage gene expression. I used Tabasco to construct a model of T7 gene expression that encodes our mechanistic understanding. The model displayed significant discrepancies from new system-wide measurements of absolute T7 mRNA levels during infection. ",

    "text": "The impact of age, exposure and genetics on homologous recombination at the engineered repeat sequence in mice Mitotic homologous recombination is a critical pathway for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and broken replication forks. Although homologous recombination is generally error-free, recombination between misaligned sequences can lead to deleterious sequence rearrangements, and conditions that stimulate homologous recombination are associated with an increased risk of cancer. To study homologous recombination in vivo, we used Fluorescent Yellow Direct Repeat (FYDR) mice in which a homologous recombination event at a transgene yields a fluorescent cell. To study homologous recombination using FYDR mice, we developed one- and two-photon in situ imaging techniques that reveal both the frequency and the sizes of isolated recombinant cell clusters within intact pancreatic tissue. We then applied these tools to analyze the effects of cancer risk factors such as exposure, genetic predisposition and age on homologous recombination in vivo. To determine the effect of exposure to exogenous carcinogens on homologous recombination, FYDR mice were treated with two different chemotherapeutic agents, cisplatin and mitomycin-C. ",

    "text": "Quantitative analysis of non-viral gene therapy in primary liver culture systems Gene therapy has the potential to cure thousands of diseases caused by genetic abnormalities, provide novel combination therapies for cancers and viral infections, and offer a new and effective platform for next generation vaccines. However, after more than three decades of research and development efforts, clinical success has yet to be realized. Successful delivery of DNA is a crucial first step in attaining safe and effective gene therapeutics. While vectors based upon recombinant viruses have shown high delivery and transfection efficiencies, they may also pose certain health risks to patients, can be difficult to target to cell or tissue types of interest, and present difficulties for large-scale manufacturing. Non-viral vectors look to offer a safer alternative and can be engineered to more effectively treat a specific cell type, tissue, or pathology, but these vectors are still plagued with low transfection levels and cannot provide adequate and sustained levels of gene expression. Continued efforts focus on producing next generation non-viral vectors that safely deliver therapeutic transgenes with the efficiency of their viral counterparts. Many barriers exist in the successful trafficking of these non-viral complexes to the nucleus. ",
