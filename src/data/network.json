        "text": "Complete drawing prototypes for urban complete streets A study was performed to determine how drawings for streets may be tailored to a broad range of viewers and agendas, yet still be viewed as a credible design tool for architects. With a growing number of cities designing their own guidelines according to the Complete Streets movements, it's necessary to develop a graphic style that not only appeals to the typical engineering aspect of streets, but is also robust enough to include details for various design components and spatial qualities not before considered in street design. New drawings and information graphics were invented to better describe multi-modal streets, spatial qualities, and a fully conceived taxonomy of urban street types. It was discovered that three drawing types are especially useful for conveying this type of information: Perspective- Sections, Overhead Views, and Transects.

Passive electromagnetic damping device for motion control of building structures The research presented in this thesis develops a new device for the passive control of motion in building structures: an electromagnetic damper. The electromagnetic damper is a self-excited device that provides a reaction force to an applied motion. We chose a tubular permanent-magnet linear machine as this new structural damper, and we derive its mathematical model using quasi-static electromagnetic theory. Computer simulations and experimental characterization of a small-scale prototype electromagnetic damper validated the mathematical model of the device. The behavior of the electromagnetic damper approximates that of an ideal damper. We conducted a feasibility study for the application of electromagnetic dampers to full-scale buildings. We used two performance measures: the damping density and the damping cost of the device. Comparing the performance of the electromagnetic damper to that of viscous fluid dampers, the maximum damping density of electromagnetic dampers is, at best, equal to that of hydraulic dampers, but with a price at least five times higher. The permanent magnet's current technology and cost are the limiting factors for the electromagnetic damper. (cont.) However, the electromagnetic damper provides flexibility not available previously to building designers as it can be used as a semi-active damper, as an actuator or as an energy regenerator without physical modifications to the device. Finally, we developed a design methodology for the electromagnetic damper to achieve a specified damping performance and introduced two techniques for the dynamic response analysis of buildings with electromagnetic dampers: One based on frequency domain approximations and one based on state-space models.

As a result, people are trapped in a mindset that discards vernacular architecture as obsolete and unpractical, and that associates modernity with the \"concrete and zinc\" model. Thriving to overcome extreme poverty, these villages plan to develop stronger economies and encourage education by building permanent school structures.

The project addresses three main issues in the field of shelter design: 1) the need of transitional shelters in a particular disaster situation (the October 8, 2005 Pakistan earthquake), 2) the design criteria for the shelters in this specific setting and a systematic way of evaluating shelter designs, and 3) a specific transitional shelter design that is produced using the established methodology. Maintaining familiarity through mobile design This thesis aims to fulfill the needs for storage, portability, and comfort in the growing population of itinerant young professionals through generating a deployable device that provides a sense of familiarity and personalization. Prior to activation, the device acts as a secure and protective container for personal belongings. Once activated, it will provide a number of surfaces that allow for work, rest, display, and storage. Acting as both storage receptacle and deployable furniture, the device allows for one to move efficiently and, in doing so, still maintain a sense of identity at different locations.

With the advent of the internet, information has been further democratized and the status of the library has been questioned. However, its status as a symbol of the city's vitality has not lessened. While the internet can speedily distribute kernels of information, books provide the means of realization. As an important cultural center of the city, the library takes on various roles in the quest to create a culture that fosters education. Thus, it is more important than ever to create a space that challenges the identity of the library as it is today and provides a forum for the interactions of the city. The work of this thesis examines the library's influence on the reader, the community, and the world at large. The importance of occupying a library building rather than \"remotely accessing\" it must be understood. Finding factoids online is a solitary activity. Speed replaces the communal activities of searching, understanding and realizing, often replacing accuracy as well. The internet cannot simulate the feeling of the book, its weight, feel, and smell. Even the taboo food stains and pencil markings in the margins of a book trace the presence of the body, the mind, and the evolution of knowledge. The history of the book can be seen not only through the printed words, but within the markings left behind and the dates stamped in the back cover. Space, materiality, and activity must be emphasized in the library to underline the difference between information of the mind and understanding of the whole. The need for interaction among patrons has lead to a broadening of the term \"library\" and its uses. This word now refers to a cultural center intended for the spread of knowledge of all sorts. What once housed the source of man's cumulative education written for posterity in books, now also serves as a source of understanding between people. This \"secular cathedral\" has merged the museum, the concert hall, and the community center, validating their lessons: What we know is not only fact, but feeling. The library touches our senses as much as our mind. The library has become a site of sharing experiences learned from study and learned from the World, brought together in one building. It is a physical manifestation of enlightenment. The library is often considered figuratively to be the container of all knowledge. Though this is impossible, the library still remains the symbol of enlightenment in a city. Thus, the stacks can become a jewel box, displaying the books as an enticement for the public. Whether this takes the form of a transparent glass cube or a isolated, self-contained capsule, the stacks can be a beacon, guiding people towards education. The journey through the library to reach the books is important, as is the method of threshold through which they are revealed. This project seeks to set an example for what a community building can be to a city by examining a site at the corner of Massachusetts and Western Avenues in Central Square, the heart of Cambridge, Massachusetts. This site, however, is vital for the municipality and would demonstrate the city's dedication to the education of all its citizens. Several bus stops begin at that very corner and the Central Square T-stop is just a block away. The transportation and governmental infrastructure is present near the site and make it ideal for a community library. The City of Cambridge currently has plans to expand its central library, located near Harvard Square. There is also a small branch library a short distance off of Massachusetts Avenue. Central Square is a vital front on which the library could expand it readership. Currently this area of Cambridge is populated with what one might call \"undesirables.\" However, the creation of the library is an opportunity to attract these people to the joys of reading. Perhaps it begins as a warm place to rest, but the library should ultimately entice its occupants into the pursuit of knowledge within its walls, as well as outside of them. The library must relate to its urban context in order to draw people in. Although Central Square appears to be very disordered, there is in fact a regular pattern of parcels which extends perpendicularly from Massachusetts Avenue. In addition, each block has two \"fronts\" which also create an axis. The library responds to the overlapping of these two perpendicular systems, allowing one of the grid areas to remain open as a plaza. The building is also striated by function, according to the fabric of the land.

The Township took its name from the Bloomfield Presbyterian Church. This church was named for General Joseph Bloomfield, the fourth Governor of New Jersey and the first Governor to be born in New Jersey Bloomfield prides itself on its rich historical background. In 1830, a town resident David Oakes established a woolen mill. This mill prospered and provided employment for hundreds of immigrants and among its various materials, uniforms for the Union Army in the Civil War. In addition, the Township housed many military leaders including General George Washington during the American Revolution. Moreover, the community's Green functioned as a military training ground during the war. Today, it remains among the most attractive features of Bloomfield. The Township Green and its surrounding buildings, including the Oakes' mansion, which is now used as a performing arts center, have been recognized as a historic district. In 1945, the Bethany United Presbyterian Church purchased a tract of property from the Township of Bloomfield. Like Bloomfield, this church has a meaningful history. Though the construction of the church building itself began in 1945, the church as a congregation became established years earlier. Its original meeting place was a local storefront just up the street of the now existing church. In 1947, the Bethany congregation marched down the street to its present location. It was a very ceremonial event that marked years of planning, prayer, hard work, and the faith of church leaders and members alike. In expressing the church's interest in obtaining the land, Reverend William H. Neebe, on behalf of Bethany's Board of Trustees wrote to the Bloomfield Town Council, \"We believe that as a church we are rendering a public service to the community Our only reason for existence is for service to the town and community... .Anything that aids the church enhances the opportunity that the church has to serve the community.\" Church housing : a symbol of hospitality This project is located in Bloomfield, NJ. Less than fifteen miles from New York City, the Township of Bloomfield was first settled by the Dutch in 1691 and later by the English in 1719.

The development and revitalization of old industrial centers in the United States has prompted urban transformations in usage, densification and demographics. These shifting neighborhoods call for a reconsideration of the makeup and syntax of their associated green spaces. The design of this urban landscape is not currently positioned to take advantage of limited spatial opportunities while meeting increasingly diverse programmatic needs. Traditional park typologies must respond to contemporary forces, varying leisure practices and allow for new interactions with an evolving city. This thesis posits a new model for parks and their architecture within changing urban neighborhoods. It explores how parks can accommodate these transformations through the topics of imbedded infrastructure, flexibility, prototyping and merging public and private usage. It seeks to create more humane and vital open spaces by adding functional and diversified occupations that respond to specific contextual requirements. This thesis looks to understand how both the landscape and its built architecture can work together to become a more viable model for the next century.

When these biological models are coupled with computational power, architectural design can begin to address the dimension of time. By dealing with the concept of duration, architecture reaches levels of complexity that match the world in which it exists. This thesis will explore the possibilities of organic and evolutionary surface in architecture and will attempt to provide a design that responds to a new understanding of duration in architecture. This thesis explores the relevance of a time-based model of architecture that draws on the concepts of organic and evolutionary form. It proposes a new understanding of architecture's relationship with time, and then uses this concept of duration as the foundation for experimental design. The goal of such an exploration is to gain a deeper understanding of the physical consequences of a new theoretical approach to architecture. A secondary goal is to demonstrate the power and necessity of computation in collaboration with biological models of architecture. The thesis includes research into nonlinearity as a challenge to the dominant understanding of the relationship between artificial and natural. From this research, the concept of duration is proposed as a new way of viewing the distinction between the natural and artificial. Duration then becomes a metaphor and guide in the design process of a studio assignment. In order to expand the possibilities of this concept, the thesis looks to ideas of adaptation and evolution as well as biological models of systems exhibiting these properties. Computation is used to model design sketches based on adaptive and genetic algorithms. Finally, a design experiment incorporates all of these ideas in an evolutionary architectural surface.

The importation of African slaves to the Americas was the economic catalyst that subsequently catapulted America in a world superpower, and questionably into imperial leadership. Speckled along the coast of West Africa, the architecture of the slave trade is as monumental and systematically oppressive as the institution it sustained. Due to the rise in prison privatization and the common practice of leasing prison labor to corporations while paying the offenders a menial fee, the American prison industry is operating more and more like slave fortresses. Spatially, the spaces are particularly similar in the areas of exterior formal qualities and parallel evolution of urban planning. Capsule homes : creating space within space Inspired by my final Studio IV project in 2010, the Capsule Hotel, and the growing demand for efficient housing due to overcrowding in developing cities, this thesis explores, examines and realizes the need for compact homes. The need of reducing a small living space to the bare necessities, whilst allowing consumers to quickly transform and personalize the function requires great understanding of space efficiency and construction methods. Realizing a carefully designed space is one thing, but actually understanding how or why it is put together in a particular way is another. In this day and age, architects tend to create with the intention of purely design and often forget to consider and fully understand how the pieces actually come together, often leaving such tasks to contractors to \"work out\". What would happen to the design industry if consumers were not only able to customize and assemble their own apartment furniture, but at the same time get involved in the design of their furniture units? How would this impact consumers as well as the industry? The driving force behind Capsule Homes is to design a product that will provide users with the everyday amenities that can be transformed and customized, whilst involving the consumers in the affordable construction process. My thesis acts as a design proposal for introducing a new method of designing and customizing living spaces, whilst involving the consumer in the process from ordering units to understanding the construction methods, to ultimately living in a customizable quarters.

In January 2010, thirteen primary schools in Sierra Leone were analyzed in order to identify design changes that will improve performance and reduce costs. One struggle that this analysis revealed is that construction methods have not changed for decades, as local builders resist changes in the current design. This thesis aims to explain small-scale alterations for primary school buildings in Sierra Leone and list the impact on daylighting and thermal comfort performance for each alteration. For each design alteration, the daylight performance, air flow, and thermal comfort of the new design are compared to the standard design. The overall goal of this thesis is to create guidelines that can be used to reduce the risk of design changes and improve the performance of schools without raising costs.

Energy efficiency in office technology This thesis, directed toward a wide variety of persons interested in energy efficiency issues with office technology, explores several issues relating to reducing energy use and improving energy efficiency of office equipment. Chapter 2 compares policies and programs in several European countries and the United States that could enhance the energy efficiency of office technology. Different programs are examined, including federal government programs where in some cases target values for power usage of office equipment have already been set. Large customer procurement programs, industry involvement, with emphasis on voluntary labeling programs, and research projects are also examined. Procedures that provide energy consumption measurements of various types of equipment are important for providing information to emerging procurement programs. Two sets of proposed test procedures for testing energy consumption of copiers, fax machines and printers are examined and compared. In Chapter 3, comparisons are made of the electrical power and energy used by computers, displays, copiers, printers and facsimile machines, both while operating and while idle. Technology options for reduced energy and power consumption and improved energy efficiency are examined. As the capability of office equipment has increased, there has been a trend toward increased electrical power requirements and energy consumption while equipment is in active operation. Computer power continues to grow rapidly. These factors will combine to exert an upward pressure for electrical power. However, some emerging technologies are lessening or in some cases reversing this trend, with little or no penalty in performance or production. The overall balance between increased service and efficiency is uncertain. Chapter 3 also examines the embodied energy of paper and office equipment. I compare it to the total energy required to produce a printed page of information, or required over the lifetime of the machine. Many difficulties were encountered in collecting and comparing data on power requirements of various machines. Procedures for testing the energy usage of office equipment are needed to make valid comparisons between machines. This thesis describes in Chapter 4, modifications to the procedure issued by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) to test energy consumption in copiers, to account for energy saver modes and double-sided copying. It also presents new procedures submitted to the ASTM committee for printers and fax machines. A fourth procedure is also presented here, one to test the energy consumption of personal computers. Typically, office equipment is not in use for much of the time it is turned on. Use of power management in office equipment can considerably decrease overall energy consumption. While energy saver modes are more prevalent in copiers, those printers that have incorporated this feature achieve more dramatic power reductions. Fax machines do not seem to utilize this technology at all, even though many have high power consumption when they are idle. How energy saving modes effect the overall energy consumption of machines is largely determined by operating profiles of the machines. The effect of operating profiles on energy usage with imaging equipment has not yet been examined. Methods of determining operating profiles of office equipment are presented in Chapter 5. A comparison is made between the energy use predicted by the ASTM procedures, energy use predicted by the ASTM procedures and actual operating profiles, and the actual energy usage of several copiers and printers. For copiers, the ASTM rated energy use per page was from 10-161 % different from the actual measured energy use per page. The use of the ASTM method with the measured operating profiles of the machine gave a 7-22% difference in energy use per page. For printers, the rated values using the ASTM method gave 61-317 % difference from the actual measured energy use per page, while using actual usage profiles with the ASTM method gave 0-6% difference. This thesis provides information on a variety of subject in the area of energy use and energy efficiency in office technology. The results provide information for emerging programs and provide a strong basis for a variety of further research.

Experience of light : the use of an inverse method and a genetic algorithm in daylight design Integration of daylight availability in time and architectural space is a critical element in achieving optimal comfort and productivity, as well as in minimizing energy consumption. In recent years, there has been an increase in the demand of the better quality of the built environment. Accessibility and availability of information do not assurance success in design. There is a gap between available information and design team. A critical understanding of the issues that affects design and its process needs to be developed. Successful strategies require the participation of individual users and designers in configuring built environments and needs. Before proposing a new solution, success factors and methodology have been identified. There are many problems-solving techniques associated with design and delivery systems. Most popular techniques are forward methods and typically employed \"trial and error\" processes, attacking problems on the front end first. On the other hand, a problem-solving technique called the inverse method seems to be efficient. It starts with designer's goals and then identifies a design to meet those goals. In an effort to provide optimum choices in daylighting design, this thesis emphasizes the use of scientific-knowledge computational tools in the later stages of design employing the inverse method. The genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to search for optimal daylighting design strategies. A new design process has been created, developed, and implemented to increase design process efficiency and creativity. This thesis additionally presents a structured method for defining and evaluating multiple objectives. Objective measures are defined as maximized visual comfort and preferred lighting conditions. The thesis introduces a new daylight glare index (DGln). Further, a study has been conducted comparing subjective glare response in an office space with the DGln. Its correlation yields very promising results. Moreover, this research investigates several design problems, GA parameters, and processes for improving design results and efficiency. The most important aspect of GA and its application is the use of computation not as an analytical tool but rather as a vehicle to stimulate learning in the design process. Finally, ideas are presented for future work, based on the potential suggested by our findings. Building load control and optimization Researchers and practitioners have proposed a variety of solutions to reduce electricity consumption and curtail peak demand. This research focuses on load control by improving the operations in existing building HVAC (Heating, Ventilating and Air-Conditioning) systems and by aggregating individual loads based on optimization studies. Emphasis is placed on electricity rates and climate data in California, where electricity costs have been of particular concern. The optimization problem in this research is multi-objective in the sense that we aim to reduce building load while maintaining an acceptable level of comfort. The first part of this research focuses on optimizing controls in a single building. A simple three-zone VAV system model is built in EnergyPlus (E+). The cost function structures and the potential difficulties associated with simulation-based optimization are discussed. Discontinuity and nonlinearity are of major concern. Two optimization algorithms are tested and applied to a variety of problems: Direct Search (DS) and Genetic Algorithms (GA). An E+ simulation based GA optimization environment is developed in Matlab. DS is found to be efficient with small problems in this research, while GA works in almost any situation with the price of intensive computation. A few operations guidelines are proposed. The second part of this research presents three ways of optimizing load control in an aggregation pool: Enumeration, multi-GA and model-based nonlinear optimization. Enumeration relies on expert rules to find a small set of feasible solutions through automated E+ simulations and search exhaustively for the optimal solution. Multi-GA solves the aggregation problem in the Matlab GA environment with (cont.) sequential E+ simulations as the function evaluator. Because simulation-based optimization is very computationally intensive in handling multiple buildings, the model-based approach develops for each aggregation participant a time series model and several regression models to predict individual load profiles under load control. It then applies an interior-point-method-based commercial solver LOQO to these simplified building models. This system is fast and easy to scale up. Certain precision is lost due to modeling simplifications, but the results are still satisfactory for practice purposes. Overall, load aggregation offers load diversification opportunities among participants and improves the aggregated load profile. Load shedding later individual load profiles in a way that enhances the aggregation performance.  Numerical solution of nonlinear algebraic systems in building energy modeling When solving a system of nonlinear equations by Newton-Raphson's method, a common means of avoiding divergence requires each step to reduce some vector norm of the residual errors, usually the convenient and tractable sum of squares. Unfortunately, the descent requirement subjects the solver to difficulties typically associated with function minimization-- stagnation, and convergence to local minima. The descent requirement also can disrupt a successful Newton-Raphson sequence. To explore these problems, the thesis reformulates the theory of function minimization in terms of the familiar Jacobian matrix, which linearizes the equations, and a vector which relates first-order changes in the norm to first-order changes in the residuals. The resulting expressions give the norm's gradient, and approximate its Hessian, as functions of the key variables defining the underlying equations. Therefore when Newton- raphson diverges, the solver can choose a reasonable alternate search strategy directly from the Jacobian model, and subsequently construct an appropriate norm for evaluating the search. Applying these results, the thesis modifies a standard equation-solving algorithm, the double dogleg method. Replacing the published algorithm's r-square norm with a general family of weighted r-square norms, it develops and tests a variety of rules for choosing the particular weighting factors. Selecting new weights at each iteration avoids local minima; in tests on a standard suite of nonlinear systems, the resulting algorithms prove more robust to stagnation, and often converge faster, than the double dogleg. In separate investigations, the thesis specializes to equation-solving a double dogleg variation which minimizes the norm model in the plane of its steepest descent and Newton-Raphson directions, and develops a scalar measure of divergence which, unlike a residual norm, does not depend on results from function minimization. An evolution-based generative design system : using adaptation to shape architectural form This dissertation dwells in the interstitial spaces between the fields of architecture, environmental design and computation. It introduces a Generative Design System that draws on evolutionary concepts to incorporate adaptation paradigms into the architectural design process. The initial aim of the project focused on helping architects improving the environmental performance of buildings, but the final conclusions of the thesis transcend this realm to question the process of incorporating computational generative systems in the broader context of architectural design. The Generative System [GS] uses a Genetic Algorithm as the search and optimization engine. The evaluation of solutions in terms of environmental performance is done using DOE2.1E. The GS is first tested within a restricted domain, where the optimal solution is previously known, to allow for the evaluation of the system's performance in locating high quality solutions. Results are very satisfactory and provide confidence to extend the GS to complex building layouts. Comparative studies using other heuristic search procedures like Simulated Annealing are also performed. The GS is then applied to an existing building by Alvaro Siza, to study the system's behavior in a complex architectural domain, and to assess its capability for encoding language constraints, so that solutions generated may be within certain design intentions. An extension to multicriteria problems is presented, using a Pareto-based method. (cont.) The GS successfully finds well-defined Pareto fronts providing information on best trade-offs between conflicting objectives. The method is open-ended, as it leaves the final decision-making to the architect. Examples include finding best trade-offs between costs of construction materials, annual energy consumption in buildings, and greenhouse gas emissions embedded in materials. The GS is then used to generate whole building geometries, departing from abstract relationships between design elements and using adaptation to evolve architectural form. The shape-generation experiments are performed for distinct geographic locations, testing the algorithm's ability to adapt buildings shape to different environments. Pareto methods are used to investigate what forms respond better to conflicting objectives. New directions of research are suggested, like combining the GS with a parametric solid modeler, or extending the investigation to the study of complex adaptive systems in architecture.  Model identification with application to building control and fault detection (cont.) may still be solved as an unconstrained linear least squares problem. To enforce the constraint on system eigenvalues, the problem is formulated as an unconstrained mixed (linear and non-linear) least-squares problem, which is easier to solve than the corresponding problem with linear objective function and non-linear constraints. The (usually unfounded) assumption on which the normal equations are based--that observations of the independent variables are error free--is relaxed at the cost of one more non-linear term. The resulting model coefficients are valid for predicting heat rate given zone temperature as well as for predicting zone temperature given heat rate. Control. Three important control applications involving transient zone thermal response are HVAC curtailment, optimal start, and night precooling. A general framework for model-based control of zone and whole-building operation is developed. Optimal precooling under time-of-use rates is formulated to solve the optimal fan operation sequence using a one-day control horizon with hourly time steps. Energy and demand cost savings are presented. Motivated by the high speed of real-time data acquisition, computational power, and low cost of generic PCs and embedded-PCs running Linux, this thesis addresses new methods and approaches to fault detection, model identification, and control. Fault detection: A series of faults was introduced into a 3-Ton roof-top air-conditioning unit (RTU). Supply and condenser fan imbalance were detected by changes in amplitude spectrum of real power resulting from the interaction of impeller rotation and the dominant chassis vibration mode. Ingestion of liquid refrigerant by the compressor was identified by detecting power and reactive power transients during compressor starts. An adaptive ARX(5) model was used to detect ingestion during steady compressor operation. Compressor valve or seal leakage were detected by a change in the leakage parameter of a simple evaporator-compressor-condenser model that explains the rise in compressor load from 0.25 to .5 seconds after compressor start, i.e. as shaft speed rises from about 50% to 90% of synchronous speed. Refrigerant undercharge was also detected by changes in start transient shape. Overcharge was detected by steady state compressor power and reduced evaporator and condenser air flow were detected by steady state power draw of the respective fan motors. Model Identification. On-line models are useful for control as well as fault detection. Model-based control of building loads requires a valid plant model and identification of such a model for a specific building or zone is a non-trivial inverse problem. The thesis develops three advances in the thermal diffusion inverse problem. Two involve thermodynamic constraints. The problem is first reformulated in such a way that the constraint on temperature  Experience of light : the use of an inverse method and a genetic algorithm in daylight design Integration of daylight availability in time and architectural space is a critical element in achieving optimal comfort and productivity, as well as in minimizing energy consumption.

This research focuses on load control by improving the operations in existing building HVAC (Heating, Ventilating and Air-Conditioning) systems and by aggregating individual loads based on optimization studies. Emphasis is placed on electricity rates and climate data in California, where electricity costs have been of particular concern. The optimization problem in this research is multi-objective in the sense that we aim to reduce building load while maintaining an acceptable level of comfort. The first part of this research focuses on optimizing controls in a single building. A simple three-zone VAV system model is built in EnergyPlus (E+). The cost function structures and the potential difficulties associated with simulation-based optimization are discussed. Discontinuity and nonlinearity are of major concern. Two optimization algorithms are tested and applied to a variety of problems: Direct Search (DS) and Genetic Algorithms (GA). An E+ simulation based GA optimization environment is developed in Matlab. DS is found to be efficient with small problems in this research, while GA works in almost any situation with the price of intensive computation. A few operations guidelines are proposed. The second part of this research presents three ways of optimizing load control in an aggregation pool: Enumeration, multi-GA and model-based nonlinear optimization. Enumeration relies on expert rules to find a small set of feasible solutions through automated E+ simulations and search exhaustively for the optimal solution. Multi-GA solves the aggregation problem in the Matlab GA environment with (cont.) sequential E+ simulations as the function evaluator. Because simulation-based optimization is very computationally intensive in handling multiple buildings, the model-based approach develops for each aggregation participant a time series model and several regression models to predict individual load profiles under load control. It then applies an interior-point-method-based commercial solver LOQO to these simplified building models. This system is fast and easy to scale up. Certain precision is lost due to modeling simplifications, but the results are still satisfactory for practice purposes. Overall, load aggregation offers load diversification opportunities among participants and improves the aggregated load profile. Load shedding later individual load profiles in a way that enhances the aggregation performance.  Experience of light : the use of an inverse method and a genetic algorithm in daylight design Integration of daylight availability in time and architectural space is a critical element in achieving optimal comfort and productivity, as well as in minimizing energy consumption. In recent years, there has been an increase in the demand of the better quality of the built environment. Accessibility and availability of information do not assurance success in design. There is a gap between available information and design team. A critical understanding of the issues that affects design and its process needs to be developed. Successful strategies require the participation of individual users and designers in configuring built environments and needs. Before proposing a new solution, success factors and methodology have been identified. There are many problems-solving techniques associated with design and delivery systems. Most popular techniques are forward methods and typically employed \"trial and error\" processes, attacking problems on the front end first. On the other hand, a problem-solving technique called the inverse method seems to be efficient. It starts with designer's goals and then identifies a design to meet those goals. In an effort to provide optimum choices in daylighting design, this thesis emphasizes the use of scientific-knowledge computational tools in the later stages of design employing the inverse method. The genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to search for optimal daylighting design strategies. A new design process has been created, developed, and implemented to increase design process efficiency and creativity. This thesis additionally presents a structured method for defining and evaluating multiple objectives. Objective measures are defined as maximized visual comfort and preferred lighting conditions. The thesis introduces a new daylight glare index (DGln). Further, a study has been conducted comparing subjective glare response in an office space with the DGln. Its correlation yields very promising results. Moreover, this research investigates several design problems, GA parameters, and processes for improving design results and efficiency. The most important aspect of GA and its application is the use of computation not as an analytical tool but rather as a vehicle to stimulate learning in the design process.

        "text": "Spatial effects and experience through reflectivity Architectural discourse on transparency has centered on the idea of layering spaces, light construction, and perceptions of different spatial relationships and has a long history from modernism to the present. This thesis proposes to question received notions of glass as a transparent material and instead focus on its possibilities as a reflective material. The thesis is an exploration of a specific material property, reflectivity, and the effects it has on architecture in terms of experiencing a space and defining a space and redefining perceptions of one's self within space. Architectural projects often draw from materials and their specific properties to create certain forms or types of spaces. Reflectivity as a material property operates on the extreme end of the spectrum of transparency. Transparency is a way of introducing layers of space and juxtaposing spaces on top of one another. Reflectivity, on the other hand, has the special property of recreating an image almost exactly but one that is dependent as an effect on the actual eye of the viewer. The location of the viewer in relation to a space and a mirrored surface becomes a relationship that can be highly controlled to create a specific effect or experience. The geometry of the mirrored surface and the geometry of the space being reflected can also be carefully controlled and designed to produce particular effects. Mirrors are unique in that they provide an opportunity where spatial relationships may not be as solidly defined as what is normally experienced. The architecture latent within the reflected image of a mirrored surface can appear to operate under its own laws of physics. There can be an ambiguous quality to a space that detracts from the more concrete materialization of the architecture. Normally, we can readily define our position within a space but the mirror distorts our perception of space beyond cognition addressing the psychological aspects of experiencing a spatial architecture.

Taking cues from natural environmental processes, the design for a contemporary playscape within existing environmental conditions provides a refuge from city life for Boston area children. The design balances between the designed landscape and the natural landscape. Natural processes over time erode the playscape away so that the transformation is perceived by the children who return regularly to the site. Considerations of natural soil behavior, water drainage patterns, soil erosion, and plant invasion are instrumented into the final articulation of the playscape.

Using an interdisciplinary approach, the artist and researcher investigates the diverse landscapes of her native Cambridge, Massachusetts: from her own backyard to the Minuteman Bikeway. Places such as public parks once felt physically infinite and natural in childhood, but are revealed as man-made and enclosed by the inorganic frameworks of the city. The level of fragmentation in landscapes experienced increases along the timeline of life, reflecting increased pace and complexity further away from home. These energetic forms lead to city exits such as highways, where one-point perspective reintroduces the notion of infinity. Methods of research include site studies, a literature review, and the development of a form generation process leading to the production of an exhibition of paintings. While at first glance some of the featured landscapes appear natural, their artificiality is revealed by the geometries of elements such as fences, pavement, and bridges. The compositions were developed iteratively using digital photography and tracing to find the most dynamic forms and rhythms. Site photos were deconstructed literally into two different layers: inorganic and organic. The final paintings subtract the inorganic layers from the organic layers, resulting in a distinctly modern, urban aesthetic.

Using water as a tool for form-finding in landscape design fosters a sense of awareness of the relationship and interaction between people, water and the land. The physical properties of water in all its states encourage thinking in terms of adaptable systems and temporality, of surface behavior and material relevance. This thesis explores the dialogue between experience and performance -- the reciprocity between form and function -- through the design of a performative landscape that re-interprets the water treatment cycle as an architectural medium in an urban setting. The groundscape topology curates a gradated ecological agenda that, over time, transforms the seamless and the uniform to a cellularized non-uniformity. This physical transformation, along with the integration of geometric scale and rates of change, informs a social program by creating public pools as a 'destination' for the water that is drained through the landscape surface. The level and quality of water in the pools is dictated by the variation of the global topography of the site, and is reflected in the temporal behavior of the groundscape, defining a coherence between the socially interactive (the architecture) and the seemingly passive landscape.

This thesis proposes a sonic facade that turns an existing building into a sound producing instrument. Sonic facade is a wind powered sound producing device that can be integrated into a wall structure. The facade is produced out of a series tubes, or more technically, a series of air column vibrators. While all the tubes may be the same length, the combination of three different types of tubes produces different sounds. This thesis proposes a seven rule shape grammar for users to determine the placement and implementation of the sonic facade on an existing building and site. The shape grammar allows for a range of simple to complex possibilities that could be applied to a variety of buildings. The sonic facade not only has an aural quality, but it is also an indicator and transmitter of the outside world. When the tubes pass from the outside to the inside of a building, the wind, the rain, and passersby bring sound inside the building.

This causes extended commuting times that result in the exacerbation of pollution and wasted allocation of resources. In effect, the overall function of the city grows more inefficient.

The lack of income diversity results in a spatial built form that also mimics this polarized condition. In these circumstances, might there be a strategy for encouraging a housing prototype that specifically targets the broad middle class market in order for cities to maintain diverse communities, a tapestry of spatial form, and a more efficient competitive city. The hypothesis is that if housing occupancy levels can be doubled from what is currently allowed within spaces that are tighter than typical American standards, then middle-income affordability can be achieved without diminishing design quality. This thesis investigates what flexible spatial possibilities there may be for middle-income housing based on a series of design priorities that are underpinned with an approach that advocates for a more intense occupancy use per unit of housing.

Each design variation is subsequently tested against a private sector based feedback mechanism that measures the affordability range that the design can offer. This iterative tool reveals what income groups can be supplied due to the design changes put forth by the varying design priorities. It is the hope that this tool will enable architects, developers, and the capital markets to understand the trade-offs made from both a spatial form perspective as well as a market perspective in order to ultimately enhance the condition of the built environment. Higher occupancy humanism : the trade-offs for encouraging middle income housing in a global city In high density urban areas where the land acquisition and construction cost components are significant relative to total development costs, the market typically supplies a high-income housing product in order to justify the risks for new construction. In places such as New York, Tokyo, London and other land supply restricted cities, the effect of these rising costs has forced the unsubsidized middle-class to migrate further and further from the center of the city where most of the infrastructural area amenities and jobs are located. This causes extended commuting times that result in the exacerbation of pollution and wasted allocation of resources. In effect, the overall function of the city grows more inefficient. All the while, the demographic texture of the central city becomes a polarized gathering of the wealthy elite and the service oriented subsidized poor. The lack of income diversity results in a spatial built form that also mimics this polarized condition. In these circumstances, might there be a strategy for encouraging a housing prototype that specifically targets the broad middle class market in order for cities to maintain diverse communities, a tapestry of spatial form, and a more efficient competitive city. The hypothesis is that if housing occupancy levels can be doubled from what is currently allowed within spaces that are tighter than typical American standards, then middle-income affordability can be achieved without diminishing design quality.

Inigo Jones's library and the language of architectural classicism in England, 1580-1640 Inigo Jones's collection of books is a unique and early survival of an architect's annotated library. The combination of standard sixteenth century Italian and French editions of classics, mathematical and scientific treatises, and specialized architectural books, comprised the library of a professional whose approach to his field was based on an understanding of practical humanism and the study of antique precedent. The library is the starting point for an investigation of the relationship of humanist learning and the creation in England of a classical architectural vocabulary. The forty~s ix books record in Jones's marginal annotations to the text and plates his interpretation of continental architecture and textual exegesis. For Jones, books were a crucial resource for the study of classical architecture as practiced in continental Europe; and necessary for an understanding of the intellectual precepts inherent in that architectural vocabulary. Jones's architectural self~education reflected and repeated the desire by patrons for a visible document of their humanist learning and aspirations. From the evidence of the marginal annotations by Jones, I discuss three central themes of the shift in architectural style in England during the period 1580 to 1640: the role of reading as an essential professional skill for the architect and its mnemonic function in design method; the use and significance of the orders as a system for representing ideas of personal and public decorum and learning; and Jones's use of the methods and resources of English antiquarians in his study of ancient architectural precedent. Each of these themes are located within the cultural and intellectual history of Renaissance England. The descriptive language created for architecture, and the images used to encourage its study, was the language of education and classical learning, and specifically, the language of books. The appropriation by Jones and his patrons of the Vitruvian notion of decorum- the distinction between the exterior of a building and its internal distribution- formed a central tenet of English classicism, in Jones's terms the creation of an architecture \"masculine and unaffected.\" The library of Inigo Jones represented one of the architect's essential professional tools, a repository of ideas and models which could serve as an ever present resource and comparable to other professional collections created by those seeking advancement within the late Tudor and early Stuart court. An annotated and descriptive bibliography of the surviving volumes, and further likely titles, attests to Jones's wide~ranging interests and design acumen.

        "text": "Switches and mortar in the Internet's shadow : a study of the effects of technology on competitive strategy for the Internet's landlords Communications technology has experienced a period of explosive growth, driven by a confluence of legal, political and technical factors including the following: the 1968 Carter Phone and 1980's competitive carrier decisions, the 1984 divestiture of AT&T, the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the development and standardization of new technologies, and the proliferation of the Internet and World Wide Web. This thesis asks the fundamental questions: How has the rapid growth of the Internet and other communications technologies changed the competitive strategy of commercial tenants, and how have these changes affected commercial real estate developers? This study proposes that developers and landlords need to use more forward-looking theories of competitive strategy in order to understand the current and future real estate needs of technology-driven commercial tenants. Telecommunications deregulation and the growth of the Internet led to the creation of a new and rapidly growing high technology industry and commercial tenancy. Deregulation and the Internet also transformed the way traditional commercial real estate uses information technology, encouraged the forging of partnerships between commercial real estate professionals and \"last mile\" information technology contractors, and resulted in the creation of a new commercial real estate product-the telecom hotel.' Current literature suggests traditional commercial tenants might differ from Internet-based business tenants in four general areas of the development process: feasibility, site selection, design and building operations. The proliferation of the Internet as a catalyst for new real estate products, commercial tenants and partnerships, and the observed differences in development practices between traditional and commercial tenants are both clues to fundamental differences between these two tenants' competitive strategies. It is possible to understand these clues to tenant behavior by taking an in-depth look at how these two tenants compete in their respective industries. Traditional commercial business tenants appear to conform to Michael Porter's theories on competitive strategy and advantage. High-tech tenant's competitive strategies seem to be more accurately reflected by Gary Hamel and C.K. Prahalad's model of competition for the future. These two theories, and the industries they represent, differ in four dimensions: Future versus Past/Present orientation, technology use, rate of growth, and resource use. In comparing three case studies on these four strategic dimensions, this thesis concludes that Porter's more stable, efficiency-oriented model does explain the strategy of Northwestern Mutual, a large insurance organization. Hamel and Prahalad's model better explains the hectic, high growth, future orientation of Akamai and YankeeTek Incubator as well as Teleplace, a telecom hotel service company. Hamel and Prahalad and Porter's frameworks explain significant discrepancies between predicted development practices based on current industry thinking, and observed development practices based on these in depth case studies. This thesis thus verifies a need by real estate developers and landlords to use forward-looking theories of competitive strategy when examining the current and future needs of hightech tenants. Switches and mortar in the Internet's shadow : a study of the effects of technology on competitive strategy for the Internet's landlords Communications technology has experienced a period of explosive growth, driven by a confluence of legal, political and technical factors including the following: the 1968 Carter Phone and 1980's competitive carrier decisions, the 1984 divestiture of AT&T, the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the development and standardization of new technologies, and the proliferation of the Internet and World Wide Web. This thesis asks the fundamental questions: How has the rapid growth of the Internet and other communications technologies changed the competitive strategy of commercial tenants, and how have these changes affected commercial real estate developers? This study proposes that developers and landlords need to use more forward-looking theories of competitive strategy in order to understand the current and future real estate needs of technology-driven commercial tenants. Telecommunications deregulation and the growth of the Internet led to the creation of a new and rapidly growing high technology industry and commercial tenancy. Deregulation and the Internet also transformed the way traditional commercial real estate uses information technology, encouraged the forging of partnerships between commercial real estate professionals and \"last mile\" information technology contractors, and resulted in the creation of a new commercial real estate product-the telecom hotel.' Current literature suggests traditional commercial tenants might differ from Internet-based business tenants in four general areas of the development process: feasibility, site selection, design and building operations. The proliferation of the Internet as a catalyst for new real estate products, commercial tenants and partnerships, and the observed differences in development practices between traditional and commercial tenants are both clues to fundamental differences between these two tenants' competitive strategies. It is possible to understand these clues to tenant behavior by taking an in-depth look at how these two tenants compete in their respective industries. Traditional commercial business tenants appear to conform to Michael Porter's theories on competitive strategy and advantage. High-tech tenant's competitive strategies seem to be more accurately reflected by Gary Hamel and C.K. Prahalad's model of competition for the future. These two theories, and the industries they represent, differ in four dimensions: Future versus Past/Present orientation, technology use, rate of growth, and resource use. In comparing three case studies on these four strategic dimensions, this thesis concludes that Porter's more stable, efficiency-oriented model does explain the strategy of Northwestern Mutual, a large insurance organization. Hamel and Prahalad's model better explains the hectic, high growth, future orientation of Akamai and YankeeTek Incubator as well as Teleplace, a telecom hotel service company.

        "text": "Brief encounter : transformation of space underneath elevated expressway through surface design The emergence of automobile culture has significantly influenced the development of contemporary cities since the late 19th century. On the theoretical level, fascination with the concept of \"mobility\" can be clearly traced from numerous visionary urban proposals by architects, ranging from members of ClAM and Team X to Japanese metabolists. Despite these creative attempts, the actual solution to the demands of motorization often resulted in erections of elevated expressways. These infrastructures are cost efficient remedy to growing traffic flow and to improve connections between points in and around cities. However, they often generate problems by breaking the continuity of urban fabric, therefore, interrupting pedestrian street life. The space underneath an elevated roadway is usually undesirable for inhabitance due to poor lighting and acoustical qualities. In regards, this thesis project intends to create an association between elevated structures and public space. The thesis, titled \"Brief Encounter\", investigates the possibility to transform the interstitial space, created by public infrastructure, into a container for pedestrian experiences. Taking the structural members of the elevated roadway as a given condition, the project aims to explore spatial qualities through various building skin/surface designs. The design concepts are guided by five parameters: usage, pattern of movement, light, acoustics, and materials. The use of natural and light-weight materials (bamboo, polycarbonate, water) is given priority. The topography generated by the surfaces responds to three program destinations: assembly, gallery/garden, and a chapel that can be transformed into an open market. These programs introduce a counter-rhythm to the everyday life, and create an anchor against the speed of automobile traffic. The goal the project is to search for a tectonic synthesis that mediates between the dynamics of different programs. Extending the infinite corridor : building the connection between academics and athletics Physical fitness and athletics are far more important at MIT than the outsider might imagine. Exercising brings together the MIT community, not only the students but also the faculty and support staff. But the architecture of the existing facilities neither accurately symbolizes nor promotes the energy and significance of the athletic community to the campus as a whole. This thesis proposes a built extension of the Infinite Corridor in the West Campus. The extension, an elevated walkway, supports campus activities, including athletics, becoming the connection between academics and athletics. The goal in building the walkway on the campus organizational axis is to reinforce athletics as part of campus life. The actual elevated experience and machine-like form of the pier and the curved roofs and exposed structure of the various design elements -- all characteristics unique to the MIT campus -- further highlights the importance of athletics to the campus. Brief encounter : transformation of space underneath elevated expressway through surface design The emergence of automobile culture has significantly influenced the development of contemporary cities since the late 19th century. On the theoretical level, fascination with the concept of \"mobility\" can be clearly traced from numerous visionary urban proposals by architects, ranging from members of ClAM and Team X to Japanese metabolists. Despite these creative attempts, the actual solution to the demands of motorization often resulted in erections of elevated expressways. These infrastructures are cost efficient remedy to growing traffic flow and to improve connections between points in and around cities. However, they often generate problems by breaking the continuity of urban fabric, therefore, interrupting pedestrian street life. The space underneath an elevated roadway is usually undesirable for inhabitance due to poor lighting and acoustical qualities.

Building community : design in the organizational mind In the search for meaning, the architectural profession legitimately seeks culture to sanction its products. However, in business organizations, culture is complex and tacit- richer and deeper than any of its external manifestations, including architecture. To compensate for culture's incoherence, the profession assumes facile access to culture through existing artifacts and spatial usage. I contend this response limits the profession's ability to engage social complexity, imbue architecture with cultural relevancy, and establish competitive advantage. This dissertation aims to provide insights into architectural form and process in relation to organizational culture. Schon contends tacit frames revealed in design activity circumscribe organizational culture. Further, the institutional and cultural status of these frames requires engaging in a collaborative design process. 'Appearances of form' in design activity demonstrate the presence of frames and simultaneously enable speculating about their tacit nature. Similar to the construction of frames, the design of an evolving physical object reveals how prior knowledge is assembled to facilitate sense-making. Design in a social setting- characterized by negotiation, conflict, and agreement- sparks the frame restructuring required to coordinate disparate agendas through organizational learning. Designing within the 'collective memory' and supplemented by the theory of type, design can leverage its potential to enlighten and improve organizational culture. Beginning with what designers share, the practices of Louis Kahn demonstrate cultivating an 'archi-type'- form containing both cultural and architectural knowledge. To imbue each with 'good' form, the architects collaboratively creating organizational space to direct architectural form and redirect cultural action. By seeking shared understanding through form, architectural design stimulates organizational reflection, learning, and agreement. Implanting these virtues occurs by an architectural design process stimulating the emergence of culture though 'bricolage' - the synthesis of current and future concerns with an omnipresent past to guide daily interaction. As form emerges, the architect encourages an organization to reassess the frames circumscribing its cultural activity. Heightening the appreciation and awareness of culture instills communal practices of cooperation, respect, and learning. To achieve such acumen and influence, however, requires 'reframing' our professional agenda to reinvigorate the cultural significance of architecture and the design process. Digital diffusion in the clinical trenches : findings from a Telemedicine Needs Assessment Broadly stated, this dissertation focuses on how practitioners and provider organizations integrate the computer and web into healthcare delivery. The opportunity that afforded this research was a Telemedicine Needs Assessment commissioned by a Massachusetts-based provider organization, consisting of two hospitals and 29 community group practices (CGP). The Telemedicine Needs Assessment incorporated qualitative and quantitative research programs to include: 1. cross-sectional, institution-wide, in-depth interviews; 2. participant observation at administrative and clinical day-to-day operations, and lastly, 3. a 68 item, closed-ended survey distributed to all 586 clinical practitioners to assess the access, use, and perceived needs of current computer, web, and telemedicine technologies. Data from the survey, (72% response rate), established a computer and web enablement baseline against which the success, failure, or potential usefulness of any future medical informatics implementation would be evaluated. Findings included: 1. Computer and web enablement within the organization is not ubiquitous. Access is high, use is low; 2. Practitioner status, practice location, and gender affect enablement. Non-MDs, CGP-based practitioners, and female practitioners report lowest access and use. 3. No differences were reported specific to home access to computers and use of e-mail. 4. Hospital-based practitioners report greater access and use. CGP-based practitioners report greater perceived needs for teletechnologies. (cont.) 5. Hospital-based and CGP-based male MDs emerge as the most polarized subgroups due to differences in computer and web use and perceived needs. 6. Female practitioners are more successful than male practitioners securing tech support at home and at work. 7. With regard to technology uptake, female MDs constitute a more homogeneous group than male MDs. Also, four products emerged from the Telemedicine Needs Assessment: 1. a needs assessment theory and methodology derived from Process Architecture which promulgates that discussions specific to the end users' work must always be inextricably linked with their work practice; 2. a typology of barriers to the integration of computer and web-based technologies into healthcare delivery stratified by practitioner, administration, organization, and industry; 3. a framework which defines and integrates real and virtual healthcare delivery services, products, and technologies, and finally; 4. a systems-based model of clinical and telecommunications integrated delivery networks providing IS, IT, and administrative infrastructure support for the framework.  Technological innovation in architecture : effective practices for energy efficient implementation The objective of this research is to simultaneously address the environmental concerns in building design and the urgency in the architectural, engineering, and construction industry (AEC) to advance technologically by providing specific responses to the following questions. What are the barriers that a design team faces when introducing environmental strategies and innovations into building projects? What are the mechanisms that can assist design teams to surpass industry standards or even break away from the limits of their own professional training? Ultimately, what is required to successfully implement environmentally sound and technologically innovative solutions in buildings? In order to gain a better insight into these issues, this research examines eight case studies and reconstructs their respective patterns of practices to discover how and why certain AEC teams successfully overcome design, development, and implementation barriers relating to energy efficient innovation (EEI) while most do not. The results of the study are categorized into four distinct, but related, components: (1) implementation techniques, (2) basic team attributes, (3) critical success factors, and (4) the implementation process. Contrary to popular belief, the findings suggest that technological innovation, specifically EEI, is best fostered by team members with prior work experience with each other, as opposed to an assembly of individuals selected solely on the basis of expertise. The repeated collaborations serve multiple functions: technical-risk reduction, financial security, and psychological assurance. (cont.) In addition, six key factors of EEI implementation are isolated and organized into two groups: team dynamics and project logistics. Team dynamics encompasses concurrent collaboration, team relational competence, and commitment to environmental goals. Project logistics encompasses external funding; research collaboration; and technical evaluation, demonstration, and validation. A strong relationship was found between the integrated design process and the commitment to EEI. Specifically, contributors of EEI worked in parallel with an expedient feedback loop or explicit feedback period. Interestingly, financial contributions external to the clients' allocated budgets were consistently found and often related to the particular research of at least one member within the team. The direct relationship between research and the resultant innovation suggests that technological innovation is not random, but rather predictable and specific to team members' areas of expertise.  Knowledge trading : computational support for individual and collaborative sense-making activities (cont.) outlined. 2. Demonstration that computer systems can use the discovered relations among data items to help users search for relevant information, prioritize the data exchange between collaborating users, and visualize data in various ways. This investigation looks at how a human's increasing knowledge about a problem space is influential in the subsequent accumulation of new data. The findings are converted into computational equivalents that can support individual and collaborative sense-making processes. This dissertation explores the potential for computational systems to analyze and support individual and collaborative human sense-making activities. In this context human sense-making refers to the act of mentally and physically relating pieces of information so as to develop an understanding of a particular situation. Human sense-making activities such as brainstorming, decision-making, and problem solving sessions often produce a lot of data such as notes, sketches, and documents. The participants of sense-making activities usually develop a good understanding of the relations among these individual data items. These relations define the context. Because the relations remain within the minds of the participants they are neither accessible to outsiders and computational systems nor can they be recorded or backed up. This dissertation outlines a first set of computational mechanisms that construct relations from the spatial arrangement, use, and storage of data items. A second set of computational mechanisms takes advantage of these relations by helping users to keep track of, search for, exchange, arrange, and visualize data items. The computational mechanisms are both adaptive and evocative, meaning that the computational mechanisms dynamically adapt to users and changing circumstances while also trying to influence the human sense-making process. Contributions: 1. Demonstration that computer systems can discover probable relations among data items from their spatial arrangement and use by users. This work identifies and analyzes various human mental processes involved in the determination of possible relations among data items such as documents on a work desk or files in a computer system. A computational equivalent is proposed for every mental process  Building community : design in the organizational mind In the search for meaning, the architectural profession legitimately seeks culture to sanction its products.

This investigation looks at how a human's increasing knowledge about a problem space is influential in the subsequent accumulation of new data. The findings are converted into computational equivalents that can support individual and collaborative sense-making processes. This dissertation explores the potential for computational systems to analyze and support individual and collaborative human sense-making activities. In this context human sense-making refers to the act of mentally and physically relating pieces of information so as to develop an understanding of a particular situation. Human sense-making activities such as brainstorming, decision-making, and problem solving sessions often produce a lot of data such as notes, sketches, and documents. The participants of sense-making activities usually develop a good understanding of the relations among these individual data items. These relations define the context. Because the relations remain within the minds of the participants they are neither accessible to outsiders and computational systems nor can they be recorded or backed up. This dissertation outlines a first set of computational mechanisms that construct relations from the spatial arrangement, use, and storage of data items. A second set of computational mechanisms takes advantage of these relations by helping users to keep track of, search for, exchange, arrange, and visualize data items. The computational mechanisms are both adaptive and evocative, meaning that the computational mechanisms dynamically adapt to users and changing circumstances while also trying to influence the human sense-making process. Contributions: 1. Demonstration that computer systems can discover probable relations among data items from their spatial arrangement and use by users. This work identifies and analyzes various human mental processes involved in the determination of possible relations among data items such as documents on a work desk or files in a computer system. A computational equivalent is proposed for every mental process  Design for achieving strategic business objectives The workplace is simultaneously functioning as a site of personal productivity and social interaction. As such, the contemporary work environment demands a multiple functioning architectural space, for which our current understandings of process, program and even building type are insufficient. As organizations become increasingly complex and their competitive environments less stable, progressively higher demands are placed on work environments. In an attempt to reframe some of our current workplace design challenges, this thesis looks to neighboring fields of research: organizational management, urban design and planning and the field of environmental psychology. This work looks to discover a more empirical understanding of success and failures in office design approaches, new modes of investigation, and new approaches to communication within an architectural intervention. Some of these hybrid components will then be deployed for making recommendations on the reconfiguration of an office of fifty educational consultants located in Boston, MA. This sample implementation is then used to evaluate the relative usefulness of tools for different purposes within the analysis and design process. Design operators Design operators is a thesis that investigates the nature and characteristics of the design process by examining the interaction of computation with architectural design. The effects of the introduction of these media in design are traced and their quantitative and qualitative characteristics are identified. The thesis hints for an emerging design mentality delineated by the implementation, documentation and critical evaluation of a series of experimental projects in computational design.

The challenge is to use this mechanism in real-world architectural contexts in which complexity and constraints imposed by the design problem make it difficult to negotiate between the emergent output, the context, and the controllability desired by the human designer. This thesis investigates how generative systems address contextual parameters, including the designer, client, user, meaning, aesthetics, environment, and function. This is demonstrated through my case studies, in which my aim was to avoid computerized unprocessed formalism that does not implicitly allow for any contextual and cultural content. I sought to extend simple algorithmic form-generation processes to allow for the subtleties of a given context to be effectively addressed. Some challenges and questions arose from these case studies. By interrogating different generative machines, common threads and challenges, similar to mine encountered in the case studies, were found. All of the processes that strove towards the creation of a generative system struggled with similar issues: How can we use rule-based systems without sacrificing meaning or function or the humanistic touch? How can we address contextual parameters without a loss?

I sought to extend simple algorithmic form-generation processes to allow for the subtleties of a given context to be effectively addressed. Some challenges and questions arose from these case studies. By interrogating different generative machines, common threads and challenges, similar to mine encountered in the case studies, were found. All of the processes that strove towards the creation of a generative system struggled with similar issues: How can we use rule-based systems without sacrificing meaning or function or the humanistic touch? How can we address contextual parameters without a loss? Poetics of furniture : augmenting furniture with technologies This dissertation focuses on one genre of new hybrid objects, namely furniture augmented with electronics. It explores the role of furniture as mediators of social interactions, as well as its potential for eliciting emotional and social responses from users. To understand the ways in which augmentations of furniture are manifested, examples of augmented furniture have been analyzed and classified into three taxonomies - by functionality, autonomy and design strategy. The dissertation does not focus on furniture situated in activities or scenarios for work-related themes, but in the theme of small moments, everyday, non-instrumental social interaction scenarios between people (for example, dinner at a table, conversation with a friend, walking on the street or reading a newspaper). Although the small moments scenarios may appear marginal, they are in fact the very glue of our daily lives. Three furniture projects are developed to explore the mediating role of furniture. They are the Conversation Table, Stealing Table and Orev Bench. The design strategy applied for addressing small moments through these projects can be best described as poetic. The projects are attempts to encourage moments of playful reflection and ultimately help their users learn more about themselves and about the objects they use.

Contextualizing generative design Generative systems have been widely used to produce two- and three-dimensional constructs, in an attempt to escape from our preconceptions and pre-existing spatial language. The challenge is to use this mechanism in real-world architectural contexts in which complexity and constraints imposed by the design problem make it difficult to negotiate between the emergent output, the context, and the controllability desired by the human designer. This thesis investigates how generative systems address contextual parameters, including the designer, client, user, meaning, aesthetics, environment, and function.

The development of the American city can be explained through the opposition between nature and culture, wilderness and city.\"-- Diana Agrest, 1996. From the Greek for study of the house, ecology refers to the relationships (or the study thereof) between organisms and their physical environment. As a field of study, ecology is relatively young, one that initially concentrated on descriptive research attempting to understand the processes of \"natural\" systems absent human intervention. Only recently have ecologists begun to argue for the understanding of the urban environment as participating in these processes. At issue in this debate is how one perceives the role of humans. The historical Western division between \"nature\" and \"culture\" is still operative; for many, the very definition of nature is that which is non-human. This thesis is an attempt to move beyond that division by forging an understanding of the city as a set of interlaced ecologies, including the biotic (animal, plants, microorganisms), the abiotic (water, wind, sun, soil), the sociocultural (social networks, psychogeography), the political (land uses, wards, school districts), and the economic (land value, capital flows), among others. Through an understanding that places humans and human settlement directly in nature, a new mode of urban intervention may becomes viable. The goal of this thesis is to explore and develop new models for understanding the ecological city, models that will enable new modes of urban intervention.

As a field of study, ecology is relatively young, one that initially concentrated on descriptive research attempting to understand the processes of \"natural\" systems absent human intervention. Only recently have ecologists begun to argue for the understanding of the urban environment as participating in these processes. At issue in this debate is how one perceives the role of humans. The historical Western division between \"nature\" and \"culture\" is still operative; for many, the very definition of nature is that which is non-human. This thesis is an attempt to move beyond that division by forging an understanding of the city as a set of interlaced ecologies, including the biotic (animal, plants, microorganisms), the abiotic (water, wind, sun, soil), the sociocultural (social networks, psychogeography), the political (land uses, wards, school districts), and the economic (land value, capital flows), among others. Through an understanding that places humans and human settlement directly in nature, a new mode of urban intervention may becomes viable. The goal of this thesis is to explore and develop new models for understanding the ecological city, models that will enable new modes of urban intervention.

The section of the document known as Leyes de Indias which deals with the urbanistic norms and the prescriptions for the laying out of the colonial cities, and the cities founded within the first three centuries of the colonial period, are the most important elements of this thesis. Several issues are to be discussed throughout the work and the most important ones are: The social and political context underlying the building up of the vast network of new cities in Latin America, The characteristics of that network and the means to control its development. The colonial city as resulting from the application of such means of control, or in other words, of the prescriptions contained in the Laws of Indias. The changes produced by contradictions on what was prescribed by those Laws and identified through a systematic observation of the available sample of cities. The reasons behind those changes. The relevancy of this work in terms of the current trends of development of Venezuelan cities. The process oriented and the product oriented views of this issue. Finally, the material is presented in two major parts containing, the first, an analysis of the context and the objectives from where the Laws of Indias were derived, of the hypothesis concerning the sources from where the Spanish planners drew those urbanistic norms, and, a description of the structure of physical space as prescribed by the Laws of Indias. The second part contains the description of the structure of physical space, and the substantiation of that description, as resulting from the application of the prescriptions and norms contained in the Laws. The substantiation is made through previous studies from Latin American, European and North America authors. The conclusion of this second part and at the same time, of the whole work, is a recompilation of those issues and of various speculations concerning their relation with today's city.

This work was done out in the open, where everyone could see it as they walked by. People grew up knowing how to take 'responsibility' for the maintenance and modification of their own home. During and after the Renaissance , when these small independent communities merged with other communities, and a specialized economy developed, the integration of functions which supported learning from the environment began to disappear. This is a study of a neighborhood in Rome, where the traditional characteristics which support the transfer of knowledge, still exist . The streets are arranged in a hierarchy from most public to most private. When work places, or retail shops, or residences, occur on a public street, they are large. When they occur on a private street, they are small. 'A hierarchy of building typologies corresponds to the hierarchy of activity sizes. The buildings which are large and located in the public zone, where people are moving quickly, have large openings. The buildings which are small and are located in private zones, where people spend time in the street, have smaller openings. The result is that the building facade exposes the appropriate amount of the work process to the residents, as they use the neighborhood.

        "text": "Deployable structures This thesis has the purpose of describing the meaning and applications of deployable structures (making emphasis in the scissor-hinged and sliding mechanisms.) and the development of new geometries, details, and mechanisms that make these systems buildable and useful for architectural applications. A deployable structure is one that can be transformed, with the addition of an energy input, from a closed stage or compact configuration to a predetermined, stable expanded form. Deployable structures are suitable in response to the following needs: a- A situation in which there is a need to create enclosed or protected space for a short period of time and then move that space to another location for erection or storage. b- Difficult access places, and/or lack of labor. c- Special applications equipment and shelters for special equipment which can not be transported in full open size and needs to be erected in a very quick way. d- Need to enclose space due to variable weather conditions. e- Situations of high risk with elevated labor costs, hostile environments, costly transportation. f- Construction aid. g- As a construction method There are many mechanisms which fall into the category of deployable structures, but we can group them into two general categories: A) Struts Structures : scissor-hinged, tensile, and sliding mechanisms, etc. B) Surface Structures : folded, inflatable, telescopic, etc. The general characteristic of group A is that these structures are made out of struts which commonly work as compression, tension or bending components connected by joints or hinges. In Group B stresses are carried by surfaces. In some, cases a continuous surface carries only tension forces like, in pressurized or inflatable construction; other structures are made out of small surfaces or planes joined together by some usually flexible means of forming a continuous structure. Deployability implies an extra cost over an assembly structure due to more sophisticated, expensive, movable connections, locking mechanisms, and deployment mechanisms. This extra cost has to be balanced by the structure's greater potential for adaptability, mobility, and labor saving construction.

        "text": "Designing national identity : recent capitols in the post-colonial world While all buildings are a product of social and cultural conditions, the architecture of national capitals raises especially complicated questions about power and identity. The architecture of a national capitol, as the seat of government within a national capital, is often a continuation of politics by other means. Part One provides an overview of the \"capital city\" as a concept, drawing a distinction between \"evolved\" capitals and \"designed \" capitals. It investigates the social and geopolitical reasons that under lie the choice of location of several designed capitals built during the last two hundred years. In analyzing each city, the focus is on the relationship between the \"capitol\" and the rest of the capital. This discussion concludes with an analysis of two ongoing projects-- Abuja, Nigeria and Dodoma, Tanzania-- where the design of new capitals is intimately connected to the search for a post-colonial \"national identity.\" Part Two begins with this concept of \"national identity,\" and stresses that what is put forth by government leaders and their architects as \"n ational\" most often contains significant biases towards preserving or advancing the hegemony of a politically ascendant group . In cases where an entire new capital is not commissioned, much of these biases can get channeled into the design of a new capitol complex instead. \"National Identity,\" when given architectural representation in a building designed to house a national legislature, is a product of these preferences. Moreover, what is termed \"n ational identity\" is also closely tied to both \"international\" identity and to the personal identities of the architects and sponsoring politicians. These issues are discussed in relation to four recently-completed capitol complexes, in Papua New Guinea, Kuwait, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Each national assembly building is a monumental edifice for a fledgling institution. Each has been designed to symbolize a highly plural post-colonial state, but reveals both subnational and supranational strains. Part Three compares and contrasts the spatial and iconographical treatment of cultural pluralism and democratic institutions in each of the four case studies, stressing the limitations of buildings that are either too literal or too abstract. It emphasizes that designers should recognize that these buildings play an ever-changing political role , and that they be conscious of the gap between their clients' (and their own) hegemonic preferences and the more inclusive promises implied by a building that is called a \"national\" assembly. It stresses that designers be aware of the ways that architectural idealizations may be used not to anticipate some more perfect future order but to mask the severe abuses of power in the present. It concludes with a discussion about how to improve the design of capitols, and offers suggestions for further research. Inquiring into architectural texts : towards an interpretation of architectural knowledge An investigation was carried out on the contents of the architectural texts in order to illuminate written architectural knowledge. The thesis takes as its case study the required reading list for Introduction to Architecture course at Yale College, Yale University, a mandatory course for undergraduate students majoring in architecture . This course, given at a school with a liberal arts education program, lists more readings than do any other similar courses given at other schools surveyed for this thesis. In this undergraduate course, the texts are used as background information for the students t o draw upon in order to do their assignments. The texts used for the course range widely, from a first-century treatise to articles published in the eighties. They represent a continuous development of architectural thought throughout the history of architecture. Yet the reading list exclude several major theoretical works of architecture. The examination of the texts shows that they are primarily theoretical,and expose different proper ties and principles of architecture and attitudes towards architects and architecture . Some of the texts contradicts with each other, others are in agreement. Very few of the texts are concerned with the practical knowledge of architecture. Humanistic, populist approaches, as exemplified by several texts written by previous faculty members of the school, seem to dominate the themes of the readings. The list does not attempt to include classical works written by non-architect authors. Organic cities and the case of Patrick Geddes in Dhaka Looking at the city of Dhaka, anyone in the first instance may feel he is perceiving a chaotic construct. But amazingly this city lives and sustains millions of people living in it. Chaos may be perceived in the very form of the city and in the way it functions. The situation of Dhaka today has grown into a very complex reality, but in the beginning of this century when the city was metamorphising to become what it happened to become today, an western town planner came to the city to give a masterplan to the city. It was almost like the ordaining of an order in the Indian tradition of founding of a city. Patrick Geddes the Scotish town planner came with a huge enthusiasm to work in India. On his eastern sojourn he came to Dhaka to produce a masterplan for the city. He perceived a regenerative organic dimension in the cities form and function, instead of chaos. His work here also raises questions as to how successful or appropriate it has been in the context of Dhaka. If he was an intruder or an interpreter in a context so opposite to his industrial background? This thesis will look into all these questions and postulate a position to interpret it based on the hypothesis presented by the proposal and the situation that exist today in the city.

Many designers, when probed for reasons to explain their actions, are either unable to answer questions, or provide explanations that are not true descriptions of their actions. Frequently the designer will answer that his or her reason for making a particular design decision is based on 'feeling' or 'intuition.' Under this model the design process assumes a 'mystical' aura. Architectural designers can create, yet are unable to say how they do so. Often that which can be explicitly discussed by the designer is the least significant part of his or her design process. It is unlikely that designers are 'channeling' information from cosmic sources. Rather, they are working with knowledge that is largely tacit. This thesis attempts to de-mystify the process of architectural design. Through a close scrutiny of existing literature, incorporation of personal experience as an architect, and testing of theories with lay, novice, and expert designers a theory of design methodology is proposed.

        "text": "The architectural design studio as a method of inquiry : a pedagogical model for the development of architectural knowledge This thesis is concerned with the systematic investigation and application of knowledge within the architectural design studio. The thesis takes, as a point of departure in the development of architectural epistemology, a model of knowledge developed by Yehuda Elkana, in A Programmatic At tempt at an Anthropology of Knowledge, Science and Cultures. Sociology of the Sciences, Everett Mendelson and Yehuda Elkana (eds.) (D. Reidel Publishing Co., 1981). It is generally accepted that the design process can be characterized in a variety of ways with respect to the development and implementation of architectural knowledge. However, it is my contention that the design process, particularly [but not exclusively] within an academic setting, is best characterized as a form of critical inquiry about architecture, leading to the development of a form of architectural knowledge-contextually dependant and conventional in nature--which can be examined, tested and modified. Therefore, the goal of the design studio is two-fold. It is to help students develop a body of architectural knowledge that they can take with them beyond the individual studio. Additionally, it is to help students develop a working method to examine new material, as well as re-examine old . If we assume this position about the design studio, namely that of a method of inquiry, is correct, then it should hold true for the instructor as well. With this position in mind, the design studio becomes an investigation into such questions as \"what is architectural knowledge?\" and \"how should it be taught?\"; which can be examined, tested, and modified in the design studio process. The journey from New Delhi to Islamabad : dependence and subversion in the ambivalent expression of nationhood This thesis addresses the critical terrain on which the colonial and post-colonial narratives of identity take shape. Taking Gayatri Spivak's aphorism that imperialism requires a rereading \"not because Empire ..... is abstract, but because Empire messes with identity\" as its premise, it attempts to map the spatio-temporal territory of identity expression inscribed between colonial New Delhi - \"The King's God Child\" - as the capital city of Imperial British India, and post-colonial Islamabad - \"The City of Islam\" - as the capital city of the nation-state the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The paper identifies a colonial legacy in Islamabad, and establishes the dialogic persistence of socio-spatial structures congruent in both cities. The independent nation status attained by much of the developing world in the last fifty years can be taken as a change in consciousness: breaking with the past is inextricably linked with the sense that tradition has been dismembered. This has led to a crystallization of memory at the particular moment of independence, and an effort to embody memory within a sense of historical continuity. Effacement of identity, which was once the only means of survival for the colonized, has been replaced by the legitimation of identity. The return to a denied heritage requires a re-invention of traditions which project an apparent coherence. Public architecture, as a form of cultural production, allows the suppression of inherent contradictions within the constitution of a nation. In this capacity it functions in much the same way as ideology. Capital cities as signifiers of a projected national identity thus provide an appropriate site of intervention for this discussion. It is the contention of this thesis that New Delhi in its epitomic narrativization of colonialism foreshadows the narrative mechanisms of post-colonial Islamabad. Sara Suleri has written: \"If English India can serve as a discursive model of any interpretive resonance, then it must illustrate a disbanding of the most enduring binarism that perplexes colonial cultural studies: it must provide an alternative to the assignation of 'cultures' to colonialism; of 'nation' to post-colonialism\". The sorry contiguity of the two terms evokes the post-colonial presence of the socio-spatial idiom of Imperial British India within the contemporary situation; this is the transitional social reality of postcolonial \"modernity\" as manifest in the architecture and urbanism of Islamabad.

These developments have established a new post-modern version of the European medieval walled cities. The need for safety in the city has caused affluent citizens to react, by supplying themselves with the kind of services that were once the municipality's responsibility. As a result one can see increased subdivision of the urban fabric into virtual miniature cities. These secluded residential pockets are a tentative answer to a pervasive need for security and control, which is significantly disrupting the traditional form of the city. The study concludes that, as local economic problems worsen and government services lessen, increased private-based measures are likely to dominate the urban scene.

The period examined starts with Theories and History of Architecture, first published in 1968 and ends with \"The Historical 'Project\"', the introductory essay of The Sphere and the Labyrinth, published in 1980 The first chapter outlines the intertwining of the two neo-idealist and Marxist components of Tafuri's thought, combined with the early familiarity with the writings of the Nouvelle Critique. Subsequently, it identifies the points that, in Theories and History, represent Tafuri's original contribution to architectural history: the identification of architecture as ideology and the consequent demystifying role that the historian must play; consequently, the formulation of the specific notions that will serve as the instruments for this task of the historian; the identity of history and criticism; the complete separation of the design process from the 'reading' process (Le. history writing) of a building; the logical consequence of this: the 'futility' of history and theory in design; and, finally, the obsoleteness of the mode of criticism termed \"operative criticism\". The second chapter tackles the problem posed by the contradictory coexistence, in Tafuri's later writings, of Marxist and neo-avant-garde positions. It analyzes in detail what neo-avant-garde ideas were, what they implied and what theoretical and methodological purposes they served. The analysis centers on the strong impact of Foucault's theories on Tafuri, and his equally strong criticism of them. Most importantly, however, it outlines the profound impact of Walter Benjamin's notion of history, particularly as exposed in \"The Theses on the Philosophy of History\", on Tafuri. In the last chapter, are drawn some partial conclusions on the epistemological implications of Tafuri's theory.

This technology provides the possibility to the industrialize housing construction and thus enhance the availability and quality of houses. With regard to the design process of precast concrete housing, architectural and technological concepts have to be woven into housing systems by iterative processes. Although precast concrete technology is an offshoot of reinforced concrete technology, its structural nature and construction process is not the same: its identification with the concept of industrialization makes this technology quite different from cast-in-place concrete. In other words, the processes of precasting, of transportation and handling, and of the erection of precast concrete building systems give significant advantages to housing systems, but they pose technological constraints to as well. This thesis investigates the technological rules and constraints of precast concrete structural systems which provide technological approaches to precast concrete housing systems. First, the methodology of the considerations of structural systems is introduced. Second, the technological rules and constraints of precasting, transportation, and construction methods are discussed in detail. Then, the technological rules and constraints of three typical structural systems, including unbraced frame, braced frame, and large panel, are examined.

The Clarke House was only discovered as a Gill building in 1981; and although praised by a prominent California historian as a project comparable in the strength of its design to Gill's masterpiece Dodge House (1914-16), there has been virtually nothing published on the project. The thesis attempts to collect the known information about the Clarke House; it documents the house through a series of new photographs, and provides a first set of drawings for the project. The Clarke House is set within the context of Gill's oeuvre in order to lay the groundwork for a wider critical interpretation. The thesis seeks a methodological approach which would avoid seeing Gill's work as either a purely regionalist phenomenon, or an example of Gill's proto-(European) modernism. Rather, the thesis adopts a method which could be called an \"iconology of materials.\" A focus on the material context does not imply any obvious mechanistic relation between the properties of reinforced concrete and Gill's architectural forms - indeed, it will be shown that there is no obvious correlation. While Gill has become synonymous with the pioneering of concrete building technology in California, his interest in the material was always tempered by an intensely pragmatic social philosophy, predicated on economy. In proposing a cultural analysis of concrete in Gill's work, the thesis attempts to account for Gill's passion for reinforced concrete and his ambivalence to its structural potential. It analyzes how Gill exploited concrete's plasticity, monolithic quality, color, and surface effects. Comparisons of the Clarke House to several other major residences also built in Los Angeles c. 1920, show that he was not alone in the metaphoric rediscovery of concrete in California. Yet, the thesis argues that Gill's particular mastery of the material, as evidenced in the Clarke House, depended on his distillation of poignant symbolic images in the work.

Technological innovation in architecture : effective practices for energy efficient implementation The objective of this research is to simultaneously address the environmental concerns in building design and the urgency in the architectural, engineering, and construction industry (AEC) to advance technologically by providing specific responses to the following questions. What are the barriers that a design team faces when introducing environmental strategies and innovations into building projects? What are the mechanisms that can assist design teams to surpass industry standards or even break away from the limits of their own professional training? Ultimately, what is required to successfully implement environmentally sound and technologically innovative solutions in buildings? In order to gain a better insight into these issues, this research examines eight case studies and reconstructs their respective patterns of practices to discover how and why certain AEC teams successfully overcome design, development, and implementation barriers relating to energy efficient innovation (EEI) while most do not. The results of the study are categorized into four distinct, but related, components: (1) implementation techniques, (2) basic team attributes, (3) critical success factors, and (4) the implementation process. Contrary to popular belief, the findings suggest that technological innovation, specifically EEI, is best fostered by team members with prior work experience with each other, as opposed to an assembly of individuals selected solely on the basis of expertise. The repeated collaborations serve multiple functions: technical-risk reduction, financial security, and psychological assurance. (cont.) In addition, six key factors of EEI implementation are isolated and organized into two groups: team dynamics and project logistics. Team dynamics encompasses concurrent collaboration, team relational competence, and commitment to environmental goals. Project logistics encompasses external funding; research collaboration; and technical evaluation, demonstration, and validation. A strong relationship was found between the integrated design process and the commitment to EEI. Specifically, contributors of EEI worked in parallel with an expedient feedback loop or explicit feedback period. Interestingly, financial contributions external to the clients' allocated budgets were consistently found and often related to the particular research of at least one member within the team. The direct relationship between research and the resultant innovation suggests that technological innovation is not random, but rather predictable and specific to team members' areas of expertise.

A strong relationship was found between the integrated design process and the commitment to EEI. Specifically, contributors of EEI worked in parallel with an expedient feedback loop or explicit feedback period. Interestingly, financial contributions external to the clients' allocated budgets were consistently found and often related to the particular research of at least one member within the team. The direct relationship between research and the resultant innovation suggests that technological innovation is not random, but rather predictable and specific to team members' areas of expertise.

In Calcutta the divisions of society within the city are becoming increasingly polarized along the lines of religion and wealth, creating a real need for a public place accessible to income and class groups from all over the city. The 'ground level' public spaces of colonialism-parks and gardens-have been taken over by the city's poor. The only zone of interaction for the city's varied population is the street; a few 'street-like' built spaces-covered street-edge arcades and the· 'interior streets' of the city's covered markets still function as public places, creating a civic collective realm. An analysis of these public places shows that rather than a static conception of public place as open 'plaza' or 'square' (which would most likely be built upon and privatized), the routes of access- the 'interior' streets-within these places are used as public places. At a small scale, a variety of environments are created by local intensifications of the access zones. At a larger scale, differentiation in the access (or 'interior street') network creates differential degrees of access that serve the needs of various groups still remaining public at the collective size. The thesis proposes that the static polarities of 'public' and 'private' space be replaced by looking at the continuum of differential access that creates particularity within the built environment, yet structures the experience as a whole. In Calcutta, the complex divisions within society are congruent with the need for the fine gradiations of accessibility that are seen in the built environments of its public places. It is the need for different degrees of accessibility that differentiates the design of public place in Calcutta from that in Western society. The architecture of Hermann Hertzberger and Aldo Van Eyck has done much to reformulate the idea of public place as 'interior streetscape'. To underscore the difference with the Indian context, the thesis examines the assumptions of individual and collective that are implicit in their designs. The thesis also analyzes the intricate degrees of accessibility created by the access systems of traditional Indian built environments at the collective size. Drawing from these sources, the design project focuses on the design of addition to the old covered market as public place, focussing on the design of the access system as the organizational structure of the built environment. Through the design of the built environment's access system the aim is to accommodate the often conflicting needs of groups within it as well as allow for it's collective use.

Digitally mediated design : using computer programming to develop a personal design process This thesis is based on the proposal that the current system of architectural design education confuses product and process. Students are assessed through, and therefore concentrate on, the former whilst the latter is left in many cases to chance. This thesis describes a new course taught by the author at M IT for the last three years whose aim is to teach the design process away from the complexities inherent in the studio system. This course draws a parallel between the design process and the Constructionist view of learning, and asserts that the design process is a constant learning activity. Therefore, learning about the design process necessarily involves learning the cognitive skills of this theoretical approach to education. These include concrete thinking and the creation of external artifacts to develop of ideas through iterative, experimental, incremental exploration. The course mimics the Constructionist model of using the computer programming environment LOGO to teach mathematics. It uses computer programming in a CAD environment, and specifically the development of a generative system, to teach the design process. The efficacy of such an approach to architectural design education has been studied using methodologies from educational research. The research design used an emergent qualitative model, employing Maykut and Morehouse's \"interpretive descriptive\" approach (Maykut & Morehouse, 1994) and Glaser and Strauss's Constant Comparative Method of data analysis (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). Six students joined the course in the Spring 1999 semester. The experience of these students, what and how they learned, and whether this understanding was transferred to other areas of their educational process, were studied. The findings demonstrated that computer programming in a particular pedagogical framework, can help transform the way in which students understand the process of designing. The following changes were observed in the students during the course of the year: Development of understanding of a personalized design process; move from using computer programming to solve quantifiable problems to using it to support qualitative design decisions; change in understanding of the paradigm for computers in the design process; awareness of the importance of intra personal and interpersonal communication skills; change in expectations of, their sense of control over, and appropriation of, the computer in the design process; evidence of transference of cognitive skills; change from a Behaviourist to a Constructionist model of learning. Digital surface representation and the constructibility of Gehry's architecture This thesis presents work in the development of computational descriptions of Gehry's architectural forms. In Gehry's process for realizing buildings, computation serves as an intermediary agent for the integration of design intent with the geometric logics of fabrication and construction. This agenda for digital representation of both formal and operational intentions, in the context of an ongoing exploration of challenging geometries, has provided new roles for computation in architectural practice. The work described in this thesis focuses on the digital representation of surface geometry and its capacity for describing the constructibility of building enclosure systems. A particular class of paper surface forms - curved surfaces with minimal in plane deformation of the surface material - provide the specific object of inquiry for exploring the relationships between form, geometry and constructibility. An analysis and framework for the description of Gehry's geometry is developed through existing theory of differential geometry and topology. Geometric rules of constructibility associated with several enclosure system strategies are presented in this framework. With this theoretical framework in place, the discussion turns to efforts to develop generative strategies for the rationalization of surface forms into constructible configurations. Building communities for design education : using telecommunication technology for remote collaborative learning The design studio, as both a learning environment and a social place, is one of the major components of architectural education. Traditionally, the studio has been considered a place for individual design work and one-on-one mentoring between an instructor and a student. With the integration of new information and telecommunication technologies, the nature of the design studio and the learning processes within it are being altered. This new landscape of the design studio offers opportunities for globally distributed collaborative work as well as new interpretations of design processes and studio practices. The technologies and the studio system are interwoven and their symbiotic relationships need to be understood if these technology-mediated long-distance collaborative design studios are to be common, valuable, and creative occurrences in architectural education. In this study, the consequences of integrating telecommunication technologies into the design studio are examined through ten cases. The new studios involve multidisciplinary design participants from separate and distant physical and social environments that are electronically connected for sharing design ideas, creating a common understanding of design practices, and co-constructing design objects. With technology use, changes occur in the studio's participants and relationships, the design content and processes, and the events and organization. I argue that the changes to the studio can create an enriched environment for design learning. The successive case studies represent a dynamic pedagogic strategy in which both students and teachers are active participants in constructing their new technology-mediated learning environment through creative experimentation. The findings of these cases provide a comprehensive description of the technical and social characteristics, conditions, and practices of remote collaborative design studios. In these new virtual design studios, there are rich opportunities for building innovative and effective communities for design education in which the traditional boundaries of time, culture, language, discipline, and institution are blurred and new configurations for design learning become possible. Customizing mass housing : a discursive grammar for Siza's Malagueira houses This thesis proposes a process of providing mass-customized housing based on computer-aided design and production systems. It focuses on the design part, which mainly consists of an interactive system for the generation of design solutions based on a mathematical model called discursive grammar. A discursive grammar includes a shape grammar, a description grammar, and a set of heuristics. The shape grammar provides the rules of formal composition, whereas the description grammar describes the design from other relevant viewpoints. The set of heuristics is used to guide the generation of designs by comparing the description of the evolving design with the description of the desired house. The generation of a design proceeds first by producing a design brief from the user-prompted requirements and then by finding a solution that satisfies this brief. Search is largely deterministic, which decreases the amount of time required to find a solution, thereby making it reasonable to develop Web-based implementations. The proposed model enables an enduring designer's dream, that of the mass customization of housing. The model is illustrated with a case study that includes a shape grammar developed for the houses designed by the architect Alvaro Siza at Malagueira, a description grammar based on the Portuguese housing regulations, and a set of heuristics inferred after a set of experiments. In these experiments, designers were asked to generate houses based on the Malagueira grammar for specific clients. It is argued that this discursive grammar provides a rigorous method for understanding and teaching Siza's design process and that similar grammars could be developed for other styles. A Web page for explaining the grammar and generating new designs on-line was developed as a prototype. Architecture theory, 1960-1980 : emergence of a computational perspective This thesis attempts to clarify the need for an appreciation of architecture theory within a computational architectural domain. It reveals and reflects upon some of the cultural, historical and technological contexts that influenced the emergence of a computational practice in architecture. To carry out this new reading, we focus on the pioneering research that underpinned the beginnings of the relationship between architecture and computation and which was carried out at four research Centres both in the UK and in the USA: The Land Use and Built Form Studies [LUBFS], founded at Cambridge, UK; The Center for Configurational Studies at the Open University, Milton Keynes; The Architecture Machine Group [AMG] at MIT, and the Design Research Center [DRC] at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA. Moreover this thesis reinterprets the role of Leslie Martin as the founding father of LUBFS by showing the influence of the British physicist Desmond Bernal's building science research and the British avant-garde movement on Martin's work. This thesis also presents reflections on how best to use computation in architecture. Reconstructing Palladio's villas : an analysis of Palladio's villa design and construction process The thesis is a presentation of a method of reconstruction using a computational device to represent and evaluate two of Palladio's un-built villas in three-dimensions. The first of The Four Books of Architecture contains text and images explaining Palladio's design and construction systems in the form of text and graphic rules. These design guidelines or rules were written for the masons and craftsmen of the 16th century, offering one and two-dimensional data on each of Palladio's villas, palaces and churches. The text only offers general treatment of the villas; it missing construction data and rules needed to execute a full reconstruction of an un-built building. Many have attempted to reconstruct Palladio's work in drawings, wooden models and computation. This thesis presents a new method of reconstruction through the definition of construction rules in addition to shape and proportional rules defined by previous scholars. This reconstruction of the Villa Trissino in Meledo and the Villa Mocenigo on the Brenta River in the form of physical models, cad drawings and computer renderings from fragmented information offered in the Four Books. The end product will serve as a method for reconstruction in the form of a three-dimensional analysis of Palladio's design and construction rules and a demonstration of the new rules, through the two reconstructions. The work began with a pilot study focused on modeling Palladio's villas in three-dimensions with little detail. The next step was to reconstruct one villa in detail following the rules, which called for a complete rewriting of the rules from the Four Books of Architecture. These rewritten rules are applied to a simple floor plan and elevation drawing in order to reconstruct Palladio's original sketch in a CAD environment. The reconstructed sketches were used to create a three-dimensional CAD file by construction rules. Afterward, three-dimensional prints, two dimensional drawings and renderings were created from the model for evaluation. The final results of each study contain textural as well as visual information on the reconstruction of two un-built villas. The conclusions demonstrate how the results can be transformed into a full three-dimensional shape grammar composed of shape, proportion and construction rules.

The reconstructed sketches were used to create a three-dimensional CAD file by construction rules. Afterward, three-dimensional prints, two dimensional drawings and renderings were created from the model for evaluation. The final results of each study contain textural as well as visual information on the reconstruction of two un-built villas. The conclusions demonstrate how the results can be transformed into a full three-dimensional shape grammar composed of shape, proportion and construction rules. Digitally mediated design : using computer programming to develop a personal design process This thesis is based on the proposal that the current system of architectural design education confuses product and process. Students are assessed through, and therefore concentrate on, the former whilst the latter is left in many cases to chance. This thesis describes a new course taught by the author at M IT for the last three years whose aim is to teach the design process away from the complexities inherent in the studio system. This course draws a parallel between the design process and the Constructionist view of learning, and asserts that the design process is a constant learning activity. Therefore, learning about the design process necessarily involves learning the cognitive skills of this theoretical approach to education. These include concrete thinking and the creation of external artifacts to develop of ideas through iterative, experimental, incremental exploration. The course mimics the Constructionist model of using the computer programming environment LOGO to teach mathematics. It uses computer programming in a CAD environment, and specifically the development of a generative system, to teach the design process. The efficacy of such an approach to architectural design education has been studied using methodologies from educational research. The research design used an emergent qualitative model, employing Maykut and Morehouse's \"interpretive descriptive\" approach (Maykut & Morehouse, 1994) and Glaser and Strauss's Constant Comparative Method of data analysis (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). Six students joined the course in the Spring 1999 semester. The experience of these students, what and how they learned, and whether this understanding was transferred to other areas of their educational process, were studied. The findings demonstrated that computer programming in a particular pedagogical framework, can help transform the way in which students understand the process of designing. The following changes were observed in the students during the course of the year: Development of understanding of a personalized design process; move from using computer programming to solve quantifiable problems to using it to support qualitative design decisions; change in understanding of the paradigm for computers in the design process; awareness of the importance of intra personal and interpersonal communication skills; change in expectations of, their sense of control over, and appropriation of, the computer in the design process; evidence of transference of cognitive skills; change from a Behaviourist to a Constructionist model of learning. Digital surface representation and the constructibility of Gehry's architecture This thesis presents work in the development of computational descriptions of Gehry's architectural forms. In Gehry's process for realizing buildings, computation serves as an intermediary agent for the integration of design intent with the geometric logics of fabrication and construction. This agenda for digital representation of both formal and operational intentions, in the context of an ongoing exploration of challenging geometries, has provided new roles for computation in architectural practice. The work described in this thesis focuses on the digital representation of surface geometry and its capacity for describing the constructibility of building enclosure systems. A particular class of paper surface forms - curved surfaces with minimal in plane deformation of the surface material - provide the specific object of inquiry for exploring the relationships between form, geometry and constructibility. An analysis and framework for the description of Gehry's geometry is developed through existing theory of differential geometry and topology. Geometric rules of constructibility associated with several enclosure system strategies are presented in this framework. With this theoretical framework in place, the discussion turns to efforts to develop generative strategies for the rationalization of surface forms into constructible configurations.

        "text": "Novel affordances of computation to the design processes of kinetic structures This paper is a discourse into the relationship between the process, computational tools and the role which symbolic structure can play in both. I argue the relationship of the process and tools is dialectic, whereby the tools we utilize in design develop new heuristics, the methodologies in tum, if reflectively understood, can be more aptly facilitated through the development of novel tools. The tools and the process then evolve together. A theory is laid out exploring the human visual information processing systems pertinence to the limitations in mental three-dimensional imaging and transformation operations relevant to the operations of drawing and mental visualization within the architectural design processes, substantiating the designers \"necessity\" to d raw (by traditional means, but more importantly here, through the inclusive integration of CAD within the process). The \"necessity\" to draw is explored as a re-presentational process to the visual system predicated upon the existence of a structured internal \"library\" of diagram-like representations. I argue that the ways we utilize such idiosyncratic libraries is predicated upon the ways in which we go about structuring the perceived \"experienced\" world around us into \"symbol systems\". And finally, the ways we utilize our reflective understanding of the heuristic transformations of these \"symbols\" within the design process in the context of a CAD environment are explored as a means to an enhanced understanding of that which is being designed and consequently as a vehicle for the development of future CAD systems to better facilitate such methodologies of designing. A personal design process of several kinetic structures is carried out in order to arrive at a localized process analysis within computer-aided design environment. Through an interactive, reflective process analysis, conclusions are drawn as to the affordances and limitations of such tools as suggestive of the operations a CAD environment might perform so as to better foster future methodologies of designing. The design \"experiments\" are utilized as a vehicle to understand the process. Specifically three kinetic projects are exploited for the prototypical \"operations\" they display. When difficulties or mental limitations are encountered with the operations, specific \"tools\" are developed to facilitate the limitation or to overcome the problem.

Design exploration through bidirectional modeling of constraints Today digital models for design exploration are not used to their full potential. The research efforts in the past decades have placed geometric design representations firmly at the center of digital design environments. In this thesis it is argued that models for design exploration that bridge different representation aid in the discovery of novel designs. Replacing commonly used analytical, uni-directional models for linking representations, with bidirectional ones, further supports design exploration. The key benefit of bidirectional models is the ability to swap the role of driver and driven in the exploration. The thesis developed around a set of design experiments that tested the integration of bidirectional computational models in domain specific designs. From the experiments three main exploration types emerged. They are: branching explorations for establishing constraints for an undefined design problem; illustrated in the design of a concept car. Circular explorations for the refinement of constraint relationships; illustrated in the design of a chair. Parallel explorations for exercising well-understood constraints; illustrated in a form finding model in architecture. A key contribution of the thesis is the novel use of constraint diagrams developed to construct design explorers for the experiments. The diagrams show the importance of translations between design representations in establishing design drivers from the set of constraints. The incomplete mapping of design features across different representations requires the redescription of the design for each translation. (cont.) This redescription is a key aspect of exploration and supports design innovation. Finally, this thesis argues that the development of design specific design explorers favors a shift in software design away from monolithic, integrated software environments and towards open software platforms that support user development.

        "text": "The Independent Group's encounters with logical positivism and searches for unity in the 1951 Growth and Form Exhibition This study analyzes the intellectual and historical milieu of the Independent Group. Its point of departure is Growth and Form, an exhibition of scientific imagery, largely conceived and designed by Richard Hamilton, and the book accompanying the exhibition, Aspects of Form, edited by Lancelot Law Whyte and including a wide range of essays by leading scientists of the day, as well as by Konrad Lorenz, Rudolf Arnheim, and Ernst Gombrich. In tracing the discourses of \"form\" and \"unity\" to several distinct sources, my study charts the unmapped territory where multiple influential, yet previously unconnected art figures may be seen to cross paths. The models of perception posited by the writers discussed in this study-a Romantic organicism, a scientific and a scientistic unitarism, and the ostensibly empirical Gestalt theory-existed simultaneously and intermingled in the IG environment.

The artist's role became one not of agitator, planner, or social engineer but of medium or seismograph as Moholy-Nagy's wrote in the 1947 Vision in Motion. This intellectual framework led the IG to see in mass culture an art form that fulfilled all the concepts of unity their milieu had to offer: it practiced a unity of art and life, constituted direct communication (unhampered by emotive speech or extra-textual references), and it practiced a cultural monism in which all perceptions were equally valid. Accordingly, the assumption was, one could decide whether something was successful or not, but ethical and political judgments could be left out as metaphysical, elitist, or, simply, old-fashioned.

Accordingly, the assumption was, one could decide whether something was successful or not, but ethical and political judgments could be left out as metaphysical, elitist, or, simply, old-fashioned.  The Independent Group's encounters with logical positivism and searches for unity in the 1951 Growth and Form Exhibition This study analyzes the intellectual and historical milieu of the Independent Group. Its point of departure is Growth and Form, an exhibition of scientific imagery, largely conceived and designed by Richard Hamilton, and the book accompanying the exhibition, Aspects of Form, edited by Lancelot Law Whyte and including a wide range of essays by leading scientists of the day, as well as by Konrad Lorenz, Rudolf Arnheim, and Ernst Gombrich. In tracing the discourses of \"form\" and \"unity\" to several distinct sources, my study charts the unmapped territory where multiple influential, yet previously unconnected art figures may be seen to cross paths. The models of perception posited by the writers discussed in this study-a Romantic organicism, a scientific and a scientistic unitarism, and the ostensibly empirical Gestalt theory-existed simultaneously and intermingled in the IG environment. The historical avant-garde's emphasis on method--such as El Lissitsky's call for \"Gestaltung als Ergebnis wissenschaftlicher Untersuchung eines Problems,\" or Hannes Meyer's call for the \"wissenschaftliche Erfassung und gestalterische Umsetzung der neuen Welt\" --continued after World War II. (cont.) But while those radical experiments were at times themselves totalizing-wanting to reform society, politics, and housing right then and there-scientific method or, in Habermas' term, a notion of \"procedural rationality,\" now served as a means of somehow 'neutralizing' politics from practices such as architecture, design, and painting. The artist's role became one not of agitator, planner, or social engineer but of medium or seismograph as Moholy-Nagy's wrote in the 1947 Vision in Motion. This intellectual framework led the IG to see in mass culture an art form that fulfilled all the concepts of unity their milieu had to offer: it practiced a unity of art and life, constituted direct communication (unhampered by emotive speech or extra-textual references), and it practiced a cultural monism in which all perceptions were equally valid.

        "text": "Developing an integrated building design tool by coupling building energy simulation and computational fluid dynamics programs Building energy simulation (ES) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can play important roles in building design by providing essential information to help design energy-efficient, thermally comfortable and healthy buildings. However, separate applications of ES and CFD usually cannot give an accurate prediction of building thermal and airflow behaviors due to the partial modeling of the problem. An integration of ES and CFD can eliminate many of the assumptions used in ES and CFD because of the complementary nature of ES and CFD results. This thesis studies the fundamentals, implementation and application of ES and CFD coupling, significantly advancing the knowledge and experience in this area. The study has been focused on the iterative coupling of individual ES and CFD programs, which shows good potential of providing reasonable results with acceptable computing costs. The research first analyzes the principles and challenges of ES and CFD program coupling. To bridge three major discontinuities in time-scale, spatial resolution and computing speed between ES and CFD programs, special coupling strategies have been developed. Particularly, the staged coupling strategies proposed can effectively reduce computing time while preserving the accuracy and details of the computed results. The study discusses the solution characteristics of iterative coupling simulation. Through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, the research verifies the solution existence and uniqueness of a coupled simulation. The investigation concludes that a converged and stable simulation can be achieved with four different data coupling methods. The study has further developed an improved iteration and control algorithm for the coupled simulation. An integrated program, E+MIT-CFD, has been developed by coupling a new- generation ES program (E+) with a newly-developed ready-to-plug-in CFD solver (MIT- CFD). All the coupling methods and strategies proposed have been implemented in this program. The program has been well validated with various experimental facilities. The comparison of numerical solutions with experimental data reveals the advantages of the integrated simulation over the separate ES and CFD applications. The study further demonstrates the performance and capabilities of the coupled program through practical (cont.) through practical design projects. Finally, sensitivity analysis of the coupling simulation to building characteristics and coupling strategies has been performed, based on which general guidelines are established for appropriate usage of the coupling simulation.  New turbulence models for indoor airflow simulation It is important to predict indoor environment in order to design thermally comfortable and healthy indoor spaces. Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) design engineers and architects widely use the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technique for indoor environment predictions. The CFD technique requires a turbulence model to correctly calculate indoor air distribution. However, the currently available turbulence models in the literature are either inaccurate or inefficient for the indoor environment predictions. To solve the problem, this thesis proposes two two-layer turbulence models and a zero-equation turbulence model. The two-layer models use a one-equation (k) model for the near wall region and the \"standard\" k -£ model in the outer region. The zero-equation model calculates turbulent viscosity based on local velocity and a length-scale. The near wall models have been developed with the aid of the data of natural and forced convection flows by Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), while the zero-equation model has been proposed empirically. One of the two-layer turbulence models is used for predicting natural convection in rooms. The other two-layer model and the zero-equation model can be used to predict forced, natural, and mixed convection in rooms. These three new models have been applied to predict different types of indoor airflows. The corresponding DNS or experimental data were used to validate the models. This study concludes that the two-layer models can predict airflows most accurately, better than many k -E models. The computing cost is significantly lower than that of the low Reynolds number k-E models and is only slightly higher than that of the \"standard\" k-E models. The zero-equation model is at least ten times faster than the \"standard\" k-E model and it is numerically stable and can predict indoor airflow with acceptable accuracy. Study of building material emissions and indoor air quality Building materials and furnishings emit a wide variety of indoor pollutants, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs). At present, no accurate models are available to characterize material emissions and sorption under realistic indoor conditions. The objective of this thesis is to fill that gap. Using the emission data measured in small-scale and full-scale environmental chambers, this investigation has developed a numerical model for simulating emissions of \"wet\" materials applied to porous substrates. This model considers VOC mass transfer processes in the air, material-air interface, material film, and the substrate. The model can predict \"wet\" material emissions under different environmental conditions (i.e., temperature, velocity, turbulence, and VOC concentration in the air) with reasonable accuracy. We developed two models for simulating VOC emissions from dry materials. One is a numerical model for short-term predictions, the other is an analytical model for long-term predictions. The models have been successfully used to examine the VOC emissions from two particleboard samples and a polypropene Styrene-Butadiene Rubber (SBR) carpet. A VOC sorption model has also been developed to analytically solve the VOC sorption rate as a function of air-phase concentrations. The model has been validated using an analytical solution as well as data obtained from sorption experiments. The emission and sorption models that we developed have been further used to study indoor air quality (IAQ) in a small office with different ventilation systems. The results show that displacement ventilation may not provide better IAQ than mixing systems if the VOC sources are from the floor. Further, our study shows sink effects from internal walls of gypsum board. Simplified methodology for indoor environment designs Current design of the building indoor environment uses averaged single parameters such as air velocity, air temperature or contaminant concentration. This approach gives only general information about thermal comfort and indoor air quality, which is limiting for the design of energy efficient and healthy buildings. The design of these buildings requires sophisticated but practical tools that are not currently available, and the objective of this thesis is to develop such a tool. The development of the simple design tool had several phases. Each phase employed simplified models validated with measured data in order to assess model accuracy and reliability. The validation data was obtained from a state-of-the-art experimental facility at MIT. Based on the collected data, we first developed simplified boundary conditions for the diffuser jet flow, which is the key flow element in mechanically ventilated spaces. The boundary conditions employ resultant momentum from the supply diffusers without modeling the detailed diffuser geometry. Although simple, the models can simulate airflow from complex diffusers commonly used for air-conditioning with reasonable accuracy. Another simplification is the use of a zero-equation turbulence model to calculate indoor air distribution. The model uses the concept of eddy-viscosity and approximate turbulent viscosity with an algebraic equation. To test the turbulence model, an airflow program was developed. The program can simulate indoor airflow on a PC within several minutes, which is five to ten times faster than with the similar programs with a \"standard\" k-£ model. Finally, the airflow program was coupled with an energy analysis program. The combined program simultaneously analyzes internal heat transfer and air movement as well as the heat transfer through the building envelope. The impacts on the thermal comfort in the occupied zone are quantified, and we found that the thermal comfort in most cases is not Developing an integrated building design tool by coupling building energy simulation and computational fluid dynamics programs Building energy simulation (ES) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can play important roles in building design by providing essential information to help design energy-efficient, thermally comfortable and healthy buildings.

The research first analyzes the principles and challenges of ES and CFD program coupling. To bridge three major discontinuities in time-scale, spatial resolution and computing speed between ES and CFD programs, special coupling strategies have been developed. Particularly, the staged coupling strategies proposed can effectively reduce computing time while preserving the accuracy and details of the computed results. The study discusses the solution characteristics of iterative coupling simulation. Through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, the research verifies the solution existence and uniqueness of a coupled simulation. The investigation concludes that a converged and stable simulation can be achieved with four different data coupling methods. The study has further developed an improved iteration and control algorithm for the coupled simulation. An integrated program, E+MIT-CFD, has been developed by coupling a new- generation ES program (E+) with a newly-developed ready-to-plug-in CFD solver (MIT- CFD). All the coupling methods and strategies proposed have been implemented in this program. The program has been well validated with various experimental facilities. The comparison of numerical solutions with experimental data reveals the advantages of the integrated simulation over the separate ES and CFD applications. The study further demonstrates the performance and capabilities of the coupled program through practical (cont.) through practical design projects. Finally, sensitivity analysis of the coupling simulation to building characteristics and coupling strategies has been performed, based on which general guidelines are established for appropriate usage of the coupling simulation.  New turbulence models for indoor airflow simulation It is important to predict indoor environment in order to design thermally comfortable and healthy indoor spaces. Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) design engineers and architects widely use the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technique for indoor environment predictions. The CFD technique requires a turbulence model to correctly calculate indoor air distribution. However, the currently available turbulence models in the literature are either inaccurate or inefficient for the indoor environment predictions. To solve the problem, this thesis proposes two two-layer turbulence models and a zero-equation turbulence model. The two-layer models use a one-equation (k) model for the near wall region and the \"standard\" k -£ model in the outer region. The zero-equation model calculates turbulent viscosity based on local velocity and a length-scale. The near wall models have been developed with the aid of the data of natural and forced convection flows by Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), while the zero-equation model has been proposed empirically. One of the two-layer turbulence models is used for predicting natural convection in rooms. The other two-layer model and the zero-equation model can be used to predict forced, natural, and mixed convection in rooms. These three new models have been applied to predict different types of indoor airflows. The corresponding DNS or experimental data were used to validate the models. This study concludes that the two-layer models can predict airflows most accurately, better than many k -E models. The computing cost is significantly lower than that of the low Reynolds number k-E models and is only slightly higher than that of the \"standard\" k-E models. The zero-equation model is at least ten times faster than the \"standard\" k-E model and it is numerically stable and can predict indoor airflow with acceptable accuracy. Study of building material emissions and indoor air quality Building materials and furnishings emit a wide variety of indoor pollutants, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs). At present, no accurate models are available to characterize material emissions and sorption under realistic indoor conditions. The objective of this thesis is to fill that gap. Using the emission data measured in small-scale and full-scale environmental chambers, this investigation has developed a numerical model for simulating emissions of \"wet\" materials applied to porous substrates. This model considers VOC mass transfer processes in the air, material-air interface, material film, and the substrate. The model can predict \"wet\" material emissions under different environmental conditions (i.e., temperature, velocity, turbulence, and VOC concentration in the air) with reasonable accuracy. We developed two models for simulating VOC emissions from dry materials. One is a numerical model for short-term predictions, the other is an analytical model for long-term predictions. The models have been successfully used to examine the VOC emissions from two particleboard samples and a polypropene Styrene-Butadiene Rubber (SBR) carpet. A VOC sorption model has also been developed to analytically solve the VOC sorption rate as a function of air-phase concentrations. The model has been validated using an analytical solution as well as data obtained from sorption experiments. The emission and sorption models that we developed have been further used to study indoor air quality (IAQ) in a small office with different ventilation systems. The results show that displacement ventilation may not provide better IAQ than mixing systems if the VOC sources are from the floor. Further, our study shows sink effects from internal walls of gypsum board. Simplified methodology for indoor environment designs Current design of the building indoor environment uses averaged single parameters such as air velocity, air temperature or contaminant concentration. This approach gives only general information about thermal comfort and indoor air quality, which is limiting for the design of energy efficient and healthy buildings. The design of these buildings requires sophisticated but practical tools that are not currently available, and the objective of this thesis is to develop such a tool. The development of the simple design tool had several phases. Each phase employed simplified models validated with measured data in order to assess model accuracy and reliability. The validation data was obtained from a state-of-the-art experimental facility at MIT. Based on the collected data, we first developed simplified boundary conditions for the diffuser jet flow, which is the key flow element in mechanically ventilated spaces. The boundary conditions employ resultant momentum from the supply diffusers without modeling the detailed diffuser geometry. Although simple, the models can simulate airflow from complex diffusers commonly used for air-conditioning with reasonable accuracy. Another simplification is the use of a zero-equation turbulence model to calculate indoor air distribution. The model uses the concept of eddy-viscosity and approximate turbulent viscosity with an algebraic equation. To test the turbulence model, an airflow program was developed. The program can simulate indoor airflow on a PC within several minutes, which is five to ten times faster than with the similar programs with a \"standard\" k-£ model. Finally, the airflow program was coupled with an energy analysis program. The combined program simultaneously analyzes internal heat transfer and air movement as well as the heat transfer through the building envelope. The impacts on the thermal comfort in the occupied zone are quantified, and we found that the thermal comfort in most cases is not Developing an integrated building design tool by coupling building energy simulation and computational fluid dynamics programs Building energy simulation (ES) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can play important roles in building design by providing essential information to help design energy-efficient, thermally comfortable and healthy buildings. However, separate applications of ES and CFD usually cannot give an accurate prediction of building thermal and airflow behaviors due to the partial modeling of the problem. An integration of ES and CFD can eliminate many of the assumptions used in ES and CFD because of the complementary nature of ES and CFD results.

However, separate applications of ES and CFD usually cannot give an accurate prediction of building thermal and airflow behaviors due to the partial modeling of the problem. An integration of ES and CFD can eliminate many of the assumptions used in ES and CFD because of the complementary nature of ES and CFD results. This thesis studies the fundamentals, implementation and application of ES and CFD coupling, significantly advancing the knowledge and experience in this area. The study has been focused on the iterative coupling of individual ES and CFD programs, which shows good potential of providing reasonable results with acceptable computing costs. The research first analyzes the principles and challenges of ES and CFD program coupling. To bridge three major discontinuities in time-scale, spatial resolution and computing speed between ES and CFD programs, special coupling strategies have been developed. Particularly, the staged coupling strategies proposed can effectively reduce computing time while preserving the accuracy and details of the computed results. The study discusses the solution characteristics of iterative coupling simulation. Through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, the research verifies the solution existence and uniqueness of a coupled simulation. The investigation concludes that a converged and stable simulation can be achieved with four different data coupling methods. The study has further developed an improved iteration and control algorithm for the coupled simulation. An integrated program, E+MIT-CFD, has been developed by coupling a new- generation ES program (E+) with a newly-developed ready-to-plug-in CFD solver (MIT- CFD).

        "text": "The \"Skyscraper problem\" and the city beautiful : the Woolworth Building The \"skyscraper problem\" challenged the thought and practice of civic designers and architects prior to World War I. It referred to the incompatibility of City Beautiful principles with economically propelled land development, and to the contradiction between the notion of architecture as an art and the skyscraper's programmatic and technical requirements. Civic designers in New York had difficulty accommodating the skyscraper in their large-scale plans. They also found that it intruded on their vision for the business street, hindered their attempts to plan City Hall Park as New York's civic center, and created a chaotic skyline. Bruce Price, Louis Sullivan, Thomas Hastings, Cyrus L.W. Eidlitz, and other architects suggested alternative proposals for subjecting the skyscraper to the constraints of design . Prior to the design of the Woolworth Building, however, architectural critics did not unanimously endorse any single approach. Frank Woolworth chose a site for his proposed headquarters at the intersection of City Hall Park, New York's civic center, with lower Broadway, the spine of its business district . Woolworth commissioned Cass Gilbert to design the Woolworth Building in 1910. Gilbert shared the City Beautiful vision of McKim, Mead & White and Daniel Burnham. He also accepted the skyscraper's pragmatic requirements. Woolworth intended his headquarters to function as a speculative office building, but also to look like a civic institution. The imagery of a civic institution would represent the capitol of his commercial \"empire\" as well as display his civic-mindedness, wealth, and cosmopolitanism. The Woolworth Building's siting at New York's civic center, its composition, its arcade, and its sculptural and mural decoration identified it with the prevailing concept of the civic building. The soaring vertical piers of its exterior recalled Gilbert's earlier design for the West Street Building, which was influenced by the functionalist ideas of Louis Sullivan. The Woolworth Building convinced critics that a suitable architectural expression could be found for the skyscraper. Zoning reformers regarded it as a benign skyscraper. Contemporary observers attuned to City Beautiful aesthetic principles thought that the Woolworth Building strengthened the order and image of New York's civic center and enhanced the view of the city from afar.

        "text": "Pascal-Xavier Coste (1787-1879) : a French architect in Egypt The purpose of this dissertation is to examine the life of a Marseilles architect, Pascal-Xavier Coste (1787-1879), his architectural work in Egypt, and his subsequent historical publications on his return to France. In Egypt, Coste served as the chief architect of the Ottoman Viceroy, Muhammad Ali, during the early portion of his reign. Coste worked on modernizing Lower Egypt through various architectural and engineering projects. I plan to show that Coste was not only responsive to the needs of progressive design but was also sensitive to the Egyptian culture, creating a stylistic synthesis of European and Islamic forms. Unfortunately, due to Muhammad Ali's military expenditures, much of Coste's work was sidelined, to be built later in the governor's reign. Coste's original designs and realized buildings, however, continued to have a great impact on the design of Egyptian architecture throughout the nineteenth century. Through a narrative of the life of Coste concluding with his publication of Architecture Arabe ou Monuments du Kaire in 1837, I will illustrate Coste's attitude toward the Muslim world, his reasons for compiling the study of Egypt's monuments, and the ultimate reception the book received in mid-nineteenth century France. Coste greatly admired the Islamic architecture of Egypt and through his work hoped to share this love with his European audience. In addition, he wished to contribute to the pursuit of Islamic architectural history. Ultimately, Coste's work had little impact on nineteenth century historical studies because of the change in European politics and Europeans' attitudes toward the Middle East during the later part of the nineteenth century. By discussing Coste's life in the context of contemporary historical developments, I will argue that Coste's innovative objectivity led to the neglect of his work during the nineteenth century and the renewed appreciation of it by historians of Islamic architecture in the early twentieth century and beyond. Modernism and professionalism in American architecture, 1919-1933 This dissertation examines the dominant conventions of architectural practice in the United States between 1919 and 1933. It proceeds from two assumptions: first, that by the 1900s, both the American Institute of Architects (AlA) and the numerous professional journals available to architects across the country solidified the profession nationally and yielded a coherent field within which practitioners could debate the content of their professional service; second, that within the context of its national discourse, the architecture profession drew inspiration for its effort to identify a social function for itself from the White City Movement which forged a link between the architect and a national political, industrial and cultural leadership drawn together by American Progressivism. The study focuses on the period following the demise of the White City Movement during which American architects cast off their allegiance to its traditional aesthetic formulae but retained the aspiration to associate themselves and their work with prevailing trends in a national political and social milieu. It demonstrates that in their efforts to redefine the terms of their professional service, American architects invoked the popular terminology of Scientific Management, Technocracy, Fordism, and the nostrums of the 'New Era' and promised 'efficiency' in their work and in the industries they presumed to manage. It reveals that within these efforts of professional redefinition, the professional ideology supporting the architect's aspirations for work converged with a modernist idealism espousing the value of technical expertise as a medium of social emancipation and progress. By giving evidence of a widespread and indigenous modernism that perceived a social benefit in the architect's capacity to utilize industrial technology, this project amends the dominant historical view which attributes the re-emergence of an American Modem Movement in the 1930s to the 'diaspora' of European artists and intellectuals before to WW II. This study has two parts. In Part One, it examines first the canons of Beaux-Arts Classicism and their gradual dissolution after World War I under the pressure of criticism from writers such as Ralph Adams Cram, Louis Sullivan and Lewis Mumford and through the work of the AlA's PostWar Committee; and second, the institutional structure of the AlA and its organizational ideologies in the 1920s. In Part Two, it looks more closely at the evolving conventions of professional service, demonstrating that American architects reached a consensus about the necessity of a 'new' architecture which identified itself in three areas: first, in its rejection of the Beaux-Arts method of interpreting a building program through a stylistic rendition of its social 'character' in favor of design strategies that maximized usable space; second, in its abandonment of the visual paradigm of the White City in favor of the expansionist rhetoric of Regional Planning; and third, in its disavowal of stylistic conventions based on historical precedent in favor of styles that both demonstrated a discontinuity with the past and celebrated an evolving consumerist 'utopia' populated by industrial commodities. L'appareil de l'architecture moderne : new materials and architectural modernity in France, 1889-1934 This dissertation is an historical inquiry into the role played by new building materials in the formation of architectural modernism in France. It proceeds on the theoretical assumption that a \"material\" is not a technical given -- a securely defined entity in the physical and linguistic senses -- but an architectural construct whose \"inherent properties\" are a matter of interpretation. It suggests that within a specific architectural culture, the conceptions and uses of a material are defined by concerns that are not only constructional but involve architectural doctrines, building practices, aesthetic projects, and cultural strategies. Since the publication of Sigfried Giedion's Bauen in Frankreich. Bauen in Eisen. Bauen in Eisenbeton (1928), reinforced concrete has been commonly accepted as the common denominator of French modernism. The dissertation questions this interpretive assumption, focusing on the changing conceptions of the material as an index of transformations in French architecture and architectural culture. It covers a period that spans from the Universal Exhibition of 1889 to the early 1930s, a period which saw the development of reinforced concrete in French architecture, from its emergence within architectural discourses to its inscription within early modernist historiography. Through a close examination of contemporary books and periodicals, unpublished sources, and graphic documents, the dissertation explores the theories and works that framed the critical relationship of new material to French modernism. Inaugurated with the late nineteenth-century demise of metal as the leading material in architectural theory, the preeminence of reinforced concrete in French architecture was marked by the dispersion of rationalist tenets into competing architectural programs. The First World War was a pivotal event in this process. Of principal importance were the positions of Auguste Perret and Le Corbusier. While Perret insisted on continuity with prewar practices, emphasizing the role of craft production, Le Corbusier embraced the rupture brought about by the societe machinique, shifting towards the idea of industrialized construction. These positions were key to the technical and aesthetic definition of the modem house, from the function of the concrete frame to the nature of external revetments. They also led the way to the cultural and ideological debates that ensued on the nationality of the material and the sources of modem architecture. In the late 1920s the return of metal merely underscored the \"rhetoric of materials\" in the definition of French modernism. The geodesic works of Richard Buckminster Fuller, 1948-68 : (the universe as a home of man) The thesis investigates the geodesic structure and dome phase in the corpus of Richard Buckminster Fuller's artifactual production and writings. It offers a history of the meteoric rise of the geodesic structure, its production, deployment, reception and subsequent marginalization. The geodesic work, as a pinnacle of Fuller's life work, form a multi-layered symbolic project with significance that extends beyond architecture. While the geodesic dome is an aspect of Fuller's many artifactual productions, it is studied here as a culmination of a set of ideas that Fuller developed and refined over a course of forty years, beginning with the 4D-Dymaxion House. These ideas represent a set of poignant observations and critique of design and design practices in particular, and of contemporary American culture in general. At a cursory level, Fuller's invention of the geodesic dome in the late forties appears to be a historical aberration, given the traditional, deeply symbolic significance of the dome and the fairly entrenched modem aesthetic sensibility based on planes and asymmetry. Yet, over a period of twenty years, the geodesic invention reinvigorated a traditional archetypal form besides charging up new interests in all types of space-frame structures. The invention of the geodesic structure invention enjoyed professional attention and rallied public enthusiasm. However, with its swan-song at the Montreal Expo '67, it was quickly eclipsed and marginalized. The thesis shows that Fuller's geodesic work is an attempt to create a seamless continuity between nature and society, following on the heels of his first attempt (in the 4D-Dymaxion House phase) to create a similar continuity between society and industry and between production and consumption. To understand anyone of these aspects, one must posit the invention in the context of its inventor and the relationship of the desires he brought to bear on American society and culture in his time. Empathy abstracted : George Fuchs and the Munich Artists' Theater Founded by the art critic Georg Fuchs and built by the architect Max Littmann in 1908, the Munich Artists' Theater is famous for its shallow \"relief stage.\" Reworking the ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche and Richard Wagner in the service of the emerging mass audience, Fuchs advocated \"the stage of the future,\" but created one embedded in its historical moment. Eliciting reactions from major figures in theater, architecture, and the visual arts, it provoked debate over the nature of spectatorship and crystallizes the complex relationship between empathy and abstraction, foundational concepts in modernist aesthetic discourse and artistic production. The relief stage embodied the modernist discourse of flatness; the performances it presented may be allied to the contemporaneous birth of abstraction in Munich. Evoking the newly popular film screen, it faced an amphitheatrical auditorium suitable for the emerging mass audience. The publication that year in Munich of Wilhelm Worringer's Abstraction and Empathy, which articulated the \"urge to abstraction,\" a universal, visceral response to art, registered the spectator's changing status in aesthetic discourse. But Fuchs was inspired by the discussion of relief sculpture presented in 1893 by the sculptor and visual theorist Adolf von Hildebrand. Through Hildebrand, he absorbed the theory of empathy, developed in late nineteenth-century aesthetic philosophy, psychology, and visual theory to describe the spectator's experience as a form of active and embodied vision. Fuchs attempted both to create and serve the mass audience, but he relied on an outmoded aesthetic model while abstraction was brewing in Munich. Ignoring Worringer's displacement of theoretical allegiances from empathy to abstraction, he never linked the relief stage to the aesthetic theory being embraced by the Munich avant-garde. His political leanings were equally conservative; he valued theater's ability to mold a group of individual spectators into the unified audience that he considered necessary for the creation of a strong German state. The promotion and reception of the Artists' Theater in 1908 present a turning point between the solitary bourgeois viewer of the nineteenth century implied by empathy and the mass audience of the 1920s, often described in terms of abstraction, distraction, and estrangement. Cultural construction of Jakarta : design, planning, and development in Jabotabek, 1980-1997 Jakarta's physical restructuring during the 1980s and 1990s was largely the result of choices made by a small circle of business and political elite surrounding President Suharto (1966-1998) in emulation of North American urban form. The insights of urban regime theory are useful in moderating any lingering economic determinism common in political economy and globalization approaches but fail to account for the successes of Suharto's growth coalition. With media controls setting the terms of reference for public discourse, Suharto' s \"New Order\" regime deployed a rhetoric of \"development,\" functioning as the overarching paradigm to coordinate individual and collective values, priorities, and assumptions while reinforcing both fears of violent repression and aspirations for the trappings of modernization. Examination of specific historical processes reveals that, unlike their dominance in the West, economic forces operated within, and subordinate to, long-standing culturally-defined structures of power, as but one of a long history of syncretically adapted forms imported from foreign sources. With culture defining the goals and means of the controlling elite, the restructuring of architecture, urban design, and planning of the Jakarta Metropolitan Area became, not just a reflection of the dominant culture, but one of the most significant instruments for achieving the desired social order. The imagery employed in the design and marketing of Jabotabek suburban real estate development played off interwoven projections of life imagined to exist in the developed West (based largely on American television and film), while the internal spaces of California-style houses reveal a hybrid formation reflecting persistent social relationships and everyday practices. (cont.) Planning's normative function to remediate and avoid infrastructure shortages and a growing environmental crisis was acquiesced in the pursuit of the New Order elite's rent-seeking projects, ultimately responsible for the financial crisis of 1997 and 1998 that ended Suharto's rule. The inescapable spatial divide driven between the enclaves of high amenity (entertainment kitchens, gated communities, private automobiles) and the left-over spaces beyond the walls of privilege (servants quarters, the kampung, the street) left a shrinking public realm increasingly abandoned to the multiple crises of failing infrastructures, poor housing, and environmental degradation.  José Rafael Moneo Vallés: 1965-1985 Rafael Moneo, a Spanish architect and educator who has been practicing architecture in Madrid since 1965, rose in the profession from local practitioner to designer of international reputation in the mid-1980s with his Museum of Roman Art in MWrida (1980-86) and into the highest ranks of academe when he assumed the chairmanship of the Department of Architecture at the Graduate School of Design at Harvard University (1985-1990). Moneo's work falls into three distinct periods: the pre-Harvard Spanish years (1965-85), the five Harvard years (1985-90), and the post-Harvard international years (1990-present). This dissertation traces the systematic and reflective character of Moneo's double practice up to 1985; it fits his uninterrupted professional practice into the context of his academic career, suggesting that his commitment to both professional practice and knowledge of the discipline is what led him to form a coherent philosophy of design. Throughout the years the contents of his teaching and writing have imbued his built projects with a programmatic character derived from his critique of modern architecture in the 1960s, investigations in architectural theory in the 1970s, and interpretation of the history of Western architecture in the early 1980s and allowed him to achieve a synthetic reading of the modern within the Western tradition of building. (cont.) It is his drive to design and explain the building, not as part of a local tradition, but as the work of a cultured architect able to transcend national borders that has allowed him to have an all-encompassing career that combines practice and teaching. Moneo is generally considered to be the most independent thinker and the most intellectual of the architects of his generation. Through the influence of the Spanish philosopher Jose Ortega y Gasset Moneo's ability to \"reabsorb his circumstances\" was a source of necessity and freedom to connect practice with intellect: he could become both architect and educator furthering the cultural development of Spain. Using the Italian aesthete Luigi Pareyson's theory of \"formativity,\" which regards material and form as inseparable, Moneo realized that the making of architectural form lay in its construction and formalized the principles of his philosophy of design.  Adolf Loos and theories of architecture and the practical arts in nineteenth century Austria and Germany This dissertation investigates changes that occurred in architectural culture in respect to conditions of modernity. Large-scale industrialization and urbanization caused dramatic ruptures with traditional social and economic hierarchies, forcing a reconceptualization of the theoretical constructs underlying architecture. During the course of the nineteenth century, writers on architecture took an active role in attempting to make sense of these changes. By the end of the century, the Viennese architect and theorist Adolf Loos set forth a critical project, often in confrontation with the views of others, to overcome the growing separation between the realms of reality and representation in design. The particular objective of this study is to situate Loos's texts within the intellectual context of Austrian and German writings on architecture and the practical arts. Such theories prefigure important expressions of modernism in the twentieth century. These writings also express a deep range of thoughts on the changing material and intellectual conditions affecting the visual arts. They exemplify a long series of attempts to create a unified identity for architecture in a world of new social relations and value systems. Despite amorphous conditions which favored social heterogeneity and difference, writers sought uniformity and an authoritative ground for architectural logic. The textual discourse in journals and books reveals the mental structures and preoccupations of writers in the grips of rapid transformation. On the practical level, new functional needs led to an expanded and diverse range of building types and plans. Further, industrial advances in construction technology and the use of new materials such as iron and glass challenged the applicability of traditional architectural forms for these new buildings. In turn, in a theoretical vein, debates on ethnic and historical genealogy and the epistemological or ontological foundations of all aspects of design turned architectural thought away from its former reliance on classicist paradigms of knowledge. It was also during the nineteenth century that historical consciousness structured architectural epistemology. As traditional guarantors of knowledge were questioned, the entirety of concepts defining architecture was transfigured. Laos and other writers sought to re-define the now hotly contested concepts of craft, art, architect, beauty, function, and truth. Conceptual production was frequently crafted through binary oppositions such as national/international or real/ideal. Loos's response to these developments was divided. On the one hand, he recognized cultural fragmentation and argued for the separate development of art and architecture. On the other hand, his vision of a design world dominated by the hand crafts and aristocratic values constitutes the Enlightenment vision of stability amidst progress. Pascal-Xavier Coste (1787-1879) : a French architect in Egypt The purpose of this dissertation is to examine the life of a Marseilles architect, Pascal-Xavier Coste (1787-1879), his architectural work in Egypt, and his subsequent historical publications on his return to France. In Egypt, Coste served as the chief architect of the Ottoman Viceroy, Muhammad Ali, during the early portion of his reign. Coste worked on modernizing Lower Egypt through various architectural and engineering projects. I plan to show that Coste was not only responsive to the needs of progressive design but was also sensitive to the Egyptian culture, creating a stylistic synthesis of European and Islamic forms. Unfortunately, due to Muhammad Ali's military expenditures, much of Coste's work was sidelined, to be built later in the governor's reign. Coste's original designs and realized buildings, however, continued to have a great impact on the design of Egyptian architecture throughout the nineteenth century. Through a narrative of the life of Coste concluding with his publication of Architecture Arabe ou Monuments du Kaire in 1837, I will illustrate Coste's attitude toward the Muslim world, his reasons for compiling the study of Egypt's monuments, and the ultimate reception the book received in mid-nineteenth century France. Coste greatly admired the Islamic architecture of Egypt and through his work hoped to share this love with his European audience. In addition, he wished to contribute to the pursuit of Islamic architectural history. Ultimately, Coste's work had little impact on nineteenth century historical studies because of the change in European politics and Europeans' attitudes toward the Middle East during the later part of the nineteenth century. By discussing Coste's life in the context of contemporary historical developments, I will argue that Coste's innovative objectivity led to the neglect of his work during the nineteenth century and the renewed appreciation of it by historians of Islamic architecture in the early twentieth century and beyond. Modernism and professionalism in American architecture, 1919-1933 This dissertation examines the dominant conventions of architectural practice in the United States between 1919 and 1933. It proceeds from two assumptions: first, that by the 1900s, both the American Institute of Architects (AlA) and the numerous professional journals available to architects across the country solidified the profession nationally and yielded a coherent field within which practitioners could debate the content of their professional service; second, that within the context of its national discourse, the architecture profession drew inspiration for its effort to identify a social function for itself from the White City Movement which forged a link between the architect and a national political, industrial and cultural leadership drawn together by American Progressivism. The study focuses on the period following the demise of the White City Movement during which American architects cast off their allegiance to its traditional aesthetic formulae but retained the aspiration to associate themselves and their work with prevailing trends in a national political and social milieu. It demonstrates that in their efforts to redefine the terms of their professional service, American architects invoked the popular terminology of Scientific Management, Technocracy, Fordism, and the nostrums of the 'New Era' and promised 'efficiency' in their work and in the industries they presumed to manage. It reveals that within these efforts of professional redefinition, the professional ideology supporting the architect's aspirations for work converged with a modernist idealism espousing the value of technical expertise as a medium of social emancipation and progress. By giving evidence of a widespread and indigenous modernism that perceived a social benefit in the architect's capacity to utilize industrial technology, this project amends the dominant historical view which attributes the re-emergence of an American Modem Movement in the 1930s to the 'diaspora' of European artists and intellectuals before to WW II. This study has two parts. In Part One, it examines first the canons of Beaux-Arts Classicism and their gradual dissolution after World War I under the pressure of criticism from writers such as Ralph Adams Cram, Louis Sullivan and Lewis Mumford and through the work of the AlA's PostWar Committee; and second, the institutional structure of the AlA and its organizational ideologies in the 1920s. In Part Two, it looks more closely at the evolving conventions of professional service, demonstrating that American architects reached a consensus about the necessity of a 'new' architecture which identified itself in three areas: first, in its rejection of the Beaux-Arts method of interpreting a building program through a stylistic rendition of its social 'character' in favor of design strategies that maximized usable space; second, in its abandonment of the visual paradigm of the White City in favor of the expansionist rhetoric of Regional Planning; and third, in its disavowal of stylistic conventions based on historical precedent in favor of styles that both demonstrated a discontinuity with the past and celebrated an evolving consumerist 'utopia' populated by industrial commodities. L'appareil de l'architecture moderne : new materials and architectural modernity in France, 1889-1934 This dissertation is an historical inquiry into the role played by new building materials in the formation of architectural modernism in France. It proceeds on the theoretical assumption that a \"material\" is not a technical given -- a securely defined entity in the physical and linguistic senses -- but an architectural construct whose \"inherent properties\" are a matter of interpretation. It suggests that within a specific architectural culture, the conceptions and uses of a material are defined by concerns that are not only constructional but involve architectural doctrines, building practices, aesthetic projects, and cultural strategies. Since the publication of Sigfried Giedion's Bauen in Frankreich. Bauen in Eisen. Bauen in Eisenbeton (1928), reinforced concrete has been commonly accepted as the common denominator of French modernism. The dissertation questions this interpretive assumption, focusing on the changing conceptions of the material as an index of transformations in French architecture and architectural culture. It covers a period that spans from the Universal Exhibition of 1889 to the early 1930s, a period which saw the development of reinforced concrete in French architecture, from its emergence within architectural discourses to its inscription within early modernist historiography. Through a close examination of contemporary books and periodicals, unpublished sources, and graphic documents, the dissertation explores the theories and works that framed the critical relationship of new material to French modernism. Inaugurated with the late nineteenth-century demise of metal as the leading material in architectural theory, the preeminence of reinforced concrete in French architecture was marked by the dispersion of rationalist tenets into competing architectural programs. The First World War was a pivotal event in this process. Of principal importance were the positions of Auguste Perret and Le Corbusier. While Perret insisted on continuity with prewar practices, emphasizing the role of craft production, Le Corbusier embraced the rupture brought about by the societe machinique, shifting towards the idea of industrialized construction. These positions were key to the technical and aesthetic definition of the modem house, from the function of the concrete frame to the nature of external revetments. They also led the way to the cultural and ideological debates that ensued on the nationality of the material and the sources of modem architecture. In the late 1920s the return of metal merely underscored the \"rhetoric of materials\" in the definition of French modernism. The geodesic works of Richard Buckminster Fuller, 1948-68 : (the universe as a home of man) The thesis investigates the geodesic structure and dome phase in the corpus of Richard Buckminster Fuller's artifactual production and writings. It offers a history of the meteoric rise of the geodesic structure, its production, deployment, reception and subsequent marginalization. The geodesic work, as a pinnacle of Fuller's life work, form a multi-layered symbolic project with significance that extends beyond architecture. While the geodesic dome is an aspect of Fuller's many artifactual productions, it is studied here as a culmination of a set of ideas that Fuller developed and refined over a course of forty years, beginning with the 4D-Dymaxion House. These ideas represent a set of poignant observations and critique of design and design practices in particular, and of contemporary American culture in general. At a cursory level, Fuller's invention of the geodesic dome in the late forties appears to be a historical aberration, given the traditional, deeply symbolic significance of the dome and the fairly entrenched modem aesthetic sensibility based on planes and asymmetry. Yet, over a period of twenty years, the geodesic invention reinvigorated a traditional archetypal form besides charging up new interests in all types of space-frame structures. The invention of the geodesic structure invention enjoyed professional attention and rallied public enthusiasm. However, with its swan-song at the Montreal Expo '67, it was quickly eclipsed and marginalized. The thesis shows that Fuller's geodesic work is an attempt to create a seamless continuity between nature and society, following on the heels of his first attempt (in the 4D-Dymaxion House phase) to create a similar continuity between society and industry and between production and consumption. To understand anyone of these aspects, one must posit the invention in the context of its inventor and the relationship of the desires he brought to bear on American society and culture in his time. Empathy abstracted : George Fuchs and the Munich Artists' Theater Founded by the art critic Georg Fuchs and built by the architect Max Littmann in 1908, the Munich Artists' Theater is famous for its shallow \"relief stage.\" Reworking the ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche and Richard Wagner in the service of the emerging mass audience, Fuchs advocated \"the stage of the future,\" but created one embedded in its historical moment. Eliciting reactions from major figures in theater, architecture, and the visual arts, it provoked debate over the nature of spectatorship and crystallizes the complex relationship between empathy and abstraction, foundational concepts in modernist aesthetic discourse and artistic production. The relief stage embodied the modernist discourse of flatness; the performances it presented may be allied to the contemporaneous birth of abstraction in Munich. Evoking the newly popular film screen, it faced an amphitheatrical auditorium suitable for the emerging mass audience. The publication that year in Munich of Wilhelm Worringer's Abstraction and Empathy, which articulated the \"urge to abstraction,\" a universal, visceral response to art, registered the spectator's changing status in aesthetic discourse. But Fuchs was inspired by the discussion of relief sculpture presented in 1893 by the sculptor and visual theorist Adolf von Hildebrand.

        "text": "Between document and monument : architectural artifact in an age of specialized institutions This dissertation is a critical analysis of the transformations in the definition of a modem architectural artifact and the artifact's changing status in an institutional context. This work develops on a series of themes which proceed on the assumption that various procedures performed by specialized institutions in architecture have been effective in the process of the definition of an architectural artifact. It starts from the proposition that transformations in the definition of architectural expressions are due to the confluence of specific institutional procedures. Since the 1970s, architectural culture was enriched with the rapid emergence and growth of a number of specialized institutions, namely, architectural museums, archives, research centers, and galleries. At the turn of the nineteenth-century, the field of architecture had witnessed a comparable process with the emergence of various architectural societies and professional organizations. Transforming the collector's practices of the enlightenment, these modern institutions sought to establish the foundations of an architectural knowledge based on documents. These institutional practices would also lead to the construction of an architectural culture based on monuments. In my study, I examine the continuation of this activity, arguing that our late twentieth-century institutions both inherited from and critically transformed these foundational projects. In the following six chapters, I examine different procedures taking place in these institutions: collecting, exhibiting, preserving, indexing, cataloguing, and instiTUtionalizing. Focusing on different materials, each thematic chapter investigates the shifts among the intellectual outcomes of these procedures. Their material and conceptual aftermath are the subject of every chapter. Each autonomous chapter is meant to gain precision from its contextual relation to the others and to the definition of the architectural artifact itself. It is not the intention of this dissertation to trace back the historical development of architectural institutions nor to choose its examples from a single geographic or historic location. Rather, by formulating the question as 'what are the intellectual consequences of a specific process and its effects on the definition of an architectural artifact?' it critically analyzes the working logic of specialized institutions in the early nineteenth and late twentieth centuries. Institutions function in the discipline not as instruments of self-powered or autonomous entities but as intellectual members of a larger cultural mechanism. Their operation regulates and is regulated by the dynamics of the discipline of architecture and is informed by a larger social framework. A concluding chapter relates the specific processes taking place in specialized institutions to disciplinary performance. It emphasizes the contradiction between process and product. This analysis will lead us to suggest that for institutionalized artifacts of architecture, there is no absolute state of being merely a document (a factual, formal, objective evidence) or a monument (a conditional, relativist, subjective interpretation). Rather, I argue that the various processes performed in specialized institutions coalesce into these two distinct statuses. This correlation suggests the integration of architectural culture into a larger cultural system.

Rather than looking to the artwork of their American artistic contemporaries, architects and critics appropriated the early European avant-garde as typological precedents, guided by a pedagogical approach steeped in Bauhaus teaching methods. Drawing became the common conduit between the abstract work of art and its transformation into modern architecture. Architecture was seen as a problem that could be studied diagrammatically, and consequently also thought of as a fundamentally conceptual, immaterial artifact. At the same time that architecture was moving towards a flattened artistic condition, however, abstract expressionist painting began to take on the material and dimensional properties of the architectural object, demarcating volume and structure. Modernist collage techniques were also introduced into postwar architectural design, but again the material aspects of the medium were suppressed in favor of its purely visual qualities. Bathrooms, bubbles and systems : archigram and the landscapes of transience The dissertation studies the Archigram, the primary avant-garde architectural publication in Britain from 1961 to 1970, and the related avant-garde practices that engendered the high-tech movement. Drawing on the histories of technology, architecture and popular culture, the study explores the roots of architecture's foray into the realm of electronic information. By challenging the machine-based model of technology that had defined modernist architectural theory and production, my thesis unfolds, the publishers of the Archigram struggled to reconcile architectural form with emerging technologies and to represent visually the dissolution of the artifact into a landscape of complex and indeterminate systems. This attempt to conceive an essentially material object, such as a house, in a world viewed as a series of impulses was among the earliest architectural explorations of the dilemmas introduced by electronic culture. Using the concept of mobility and flux as a unifying thread, the dissertation examines the strategy for developing an architecture based in the practice of representation and of dissemination. The desire to set structures in motion by liberating them from the anchor of urban infrastructures required a reconsideration of the architectural object. For architecture to fully abandon its traditional role as environmental hardware, the conflict between the processes of indeterminacy and the dependence of those processes on a closed system would have to be overcome. (cont.) This tension between the physical and the dematerialized led from megastructural networks to self-contained skins, and finally to the disintegration of architectural objects into a technologically driven version of the Picturesque. In the ultimate merging of the environmental domain with that of information, architecture would become its absence, marked in the landscape only as the residue of a nomadic culture of information.  Israelizing Jerusalem : the encounter between architectural and national ideologies, 1967-1977 The victorious Israeli acquisition of East Jerusalem during the 1967 War set off industrious construction intended to turn a modernist Israeli town and an ancient Jordanian city into \"a united (and indivisible)\" Israeli Jerusalem. This dissertation questions the reasons and venues for the consequent architectural break with high modernism that defined the built landscape of Jerusalem between 1967 and the first political defeat of Labor Zionism in 1977. For Mayor Teddy Kollek, who aspired to legitimate Israeli rule over Jerusalem on cultural and aesthetic grounds, architects were indispensable agents. However, invited luminaries, like Louis Kahn, Bruno Zevi, Philip Johnson and Lewis Mumford, forcefully attacked Jerusalem's modernist masterplan in favor of a spiritual and historical theme for the city. Their criticism became the catalyst for a beautification campaign that intriguingly resembled the British Mandate's \"colonial regionalism.\" It also inspired younger Israeli-born architects whose quest to create an \"architecture of the place\" was ambivalently modeled after the Palestinian vernacular. By casting this architecture as biblical, primitive or Mediterranean, these architects emerged as interlocutors who mediated national identity into built and lived environment, culminating in Moshe Safdie's integration of archeology, the vernacular and technology in his authorized design for the Western Wall Plaza. (cont.) Based on structural analysis, archival research and interviews with architects, planners and politicians, as well as the insights of recent literature on nationalism, Orientalism and post-colonialism, this dissertation offers the first critical account of Jerusalem's architecture during statehood and in light of the prevailing debates in post-WWII architectural culture at large. It argues that modernist architecture geared toward the state's values of progress and development fell short of expressing the symbolism of the Jewish nation as it emerged in post-67 Jerusalem. In this context, post-WWII architectural theory's emphasis on Man, community, memory and place helped architects create a symbolic terrain for the mamlachtiyut project that mediated between the new state and its historical \"national home.\" This \"localist\" program for Israeli architecture, however, could hardly survive the Palestinian intifadas, during which Israeli architectural historiography retreated back into the modernist origins of Israeliness as yet uncontaminated by the conflict and the Orient. Ironically, the \"architecture of the place\" rendered transparent the ambiguity of the Israeli national-colonial project.

It highlights the previously ignored central role that these institutions played in the consolidation of papal power and the political administration of the city. The study focuses on the SS.ma Trinita dei Pellegrini at Ponte Sisto, a shelter of pilgrims and convalescents, and one of the four large public hospitals in the city. The building history of the Trinita is analyzed from the middle of the sixteenth century to the end of the seventeenth. The impact of the Trinita on the neighborhood is also examined. This reveals an instance of collaboration among three institutions -- the Trinita, the Monte di Pieta, and a Hospice for Beggars built by Sixtus V -- and a papal family, the Barberini, in the transformation of their quarter. These institutions were also an integral portion of papal urban plans. Their large complexes were part of an urban system that included a bridge, the main supply route of the city, and an urban barrier that separated the poorer quarters of the city, and the Jewish Ghetto, from those where wealthy families were building their palaces. Finally, the analysis of the economic context of the Trinita and similar institutions emphasizes the connection between their sources of wealth and the ways they displayed their identity.

        "text": "Design by grammar : algorithmic design in an architectural context An experimental study was performed to explore the practical applicability of the rule based design method of shape grammars. The shape grammar method is used for the analysis and synthesis of the hayat house type in a particular context. In the analysis part, the shape grammar method is used to extract basic compositional principles of the hayat house. In the synthesis part, first the evolution of a new hayat house prototype is illustrated. An algorithmic prototype transformation is considered. This transformation is achieved in two ways: by changing the values assigned to the variables that define the component objects of the form, and by replacing the vocabulary elements of the form with new ones. Then, the application of the rule based design method for housing pattern generation is explored. The design of a housing complex is illustrated using this method. A shape grammar for teaching the architectural style of the Yingzao fashi The Yingzaofashi [Building standards] is a Chinese building manual written by Li Jie (d. 1110) and published in 1103. I present a shape grammar for teaching the architectural style - the language of designs - described in this manual. This grammar is distinguished by two objectives, and the technical means used to accomplish them. First, the grammar is for teaching. Usually, the author of a grammar of a style aims to generate all and only the designs in the language. To do this, he not only writes the grammar, but also judges whether the designs it generates are members of the language. In the Yingzaofashi grammar, on the other hand, I want to generate all and more than the designs in the language. It is then the student who evaluates the designs - does this design belong to the language? - and adjusts the grammar accordingly. Thus the student participates actively in defining the language of designs, and learns that style is a human construct. Second, the grammar is designerly. As already observed, most authors of style grammars focus on the language of designs; they do not consider how to structure the user's interaction with the grammar. By contrast, I consider explicitly what the user decides and when he decides it, and organize the grammar accordingly. In other words, I consider process as well as products. The grammar exploits several technical devices for the first time: the design as an n-tuple of drawings, descriptions, and other elements; the generation of descriptions in the n-tuple; and techniques that are made possible by these devices. Design by grammar : algorithmic design in an architectural context An experimental study was performed to explore the practical applicability of the rule based design method of shape grammars. The shape grammar method is used for the analysis and synthesis of the hayat house type in a particular context.

I present a shape grammar for teaching the architectural style - the language of designs - described in this manual. This grammar is distinguished by two objectives, and the technical means used to accomplish them. First, the grammar is for teaching. Usually, the author of a grammar of a style aims to generate all and only the designs in the language. To do this, he not only writes the grammar, but also judges whether the designs it generates are members of the language. In the Yingzaofashi grammar, on the other hand, I want to generate all and more than the designs in the language. It is then the student who evaluates the designs - does this design belong to the language? - and adjusts the grammar accordingly. Thus the student participates actively in defining the language of designs, and learns that style is a human construct. Second, the grammar is designerly. As already observed, most authors of style grammars focus on the language of designs; they do not consider how to structure the user's interaction with the grammar. By contrast, I consider explicitly what the user decides and when he decides it, and organize the grammar accordingly. In other words, I consider process as well as products. The grammar exploits several technical devices for the first time: the design as an n-tuple of drawings, descriptions, and other elements; the generation of descriptions in the n-tuple; and techniques that are made possible by these devices.

        "text": "A system for image-based modeling and photo editing Traditionally in computer graphics, a scene is represented by geometric primitives composed of various materials and a collection of lights. Recently, techniques for modeling and rendering scenes from a set of pre-acquired images have emerged as an alternative approach, known as image-based modeling and rendering. Much of the research in this field has focused on reconstructing and rerendering from a set of photographs, while little work has been done to address the problem of editing and modifying these scenes. On the other hand, photo-editing systems, such as Adobe Photoshop, provide a powerful, intuitive, and practical means to edit images. However, these systems are limited by their two-dimensional nature. In this thesis, we present a system that extends photo editing to 3D. Starting from a single input image, the system enables the user to reconstruct a 3D representation of the captured scene, and edit it with the ease and versatility of 2D photo editing. The scene is represented as layers of images with depth, where each layer is an image that encodes both color and depth. A suite of user-assisted tools are employed, based on a painting metaphor, to extract layers and assign depths. The system enables editing from different viewpoints, extracting and grouping of image-based objects, and modifying the shape, color, and illumination of these objects. As part of the system, we introduce three powerful new editing tools. These include two new clone brushing tools: the non-distorted clone brush and the structure-preserving clone brush. They permit copying of parts of an image to another via a brush interface, but alleviate distortions due to perspective foreshortening and object geometry. (cont.) The non-distorted clone brush works on arbitrary 3D geometry, while the structure-preserving clone brush, a 2D version, assumes a planar surface, but has the added advantage of working directly in 2D photo-editing systems that lack depth information. The third tool, a texture-illuminance decoupling filter, discounts the effect of illumination on uniformly textured areas by decoupling large- and small-scale features via bilateral filtering. This tool is crucial for relighting and changing the materials of the scene. There are many applications for such a system, for example architectural, lighting and landscape design, entertainment and special effects, games, and virtual TV sets. The system allows the user to superimpose scaled architectural models into real environments, or to quickly paint a desired lighting scheme of an interior, while being able to navigate within the scene for a fully immersive 3D experience. We present examples and results of complex architectural scenes, 360-degree panoramas, and even paintings, where the user can change viewpoints, edit the geometry and materials, and relight the environment.

To enforce the constraint on system eigenvalues, the problem is formulated as an unconstrained mixed (linear and non-linear) least-squares problem, which is easier to solve than the corresponding problem with linear objective function and non-linear constraints. The (usually unfounded) assumption on which the normal equations are based--that observations of the independent variables are error free--is relaxed at the cost of one more non-linear term.

        "text": "Just-in-time information retrieval This thesis defines Just-In-Time Information Retrieval agents (JITIRs): a class of software agents that proactively present potentially valuable information based on a person's local context in an easily accessible yet non-intrusive manner. The research described experimentally demonstrates that such systems encourage the viewing and use of information that would not otherwise be viewed, by reducing the cognitive effort required to find, evaluate and access information. Experiments and analysis of long-term use provide a deeper understanding of the different ways JITIRs can be valuable: by providing useful or supporting information that is relevant to the current task, by contextualizing the current task in a broader framework, by providing information that is not useful in the current task but leads to the discovery of other information that is useful, and by providing information that is not useful for the current task but is valuable for other reasons. Finally, this research documents heuristics and techniques for the design of JITIRs. These techniques are based on theory and are demonstrated by the field-testing of three complete systems: the Remembrance Agent, Margin Notes, and Jimminy. Specifically, these heuristics are designed to make information accessible with low effort, and yet ignorable should the user wish to concentrate entirely on his primary task. Microevolutionary language theory A new microevolutionary theory of complex design within language is proposed. Experiments were carried out that support the theory that complex functional design - adaptive complexity - accumulates due to the evolutionary algorithm at the simplest levels within human natural language. A large software system was developed which identifies and tracks evolutionary dynamics within text discourse. With this system hundreds of examples of activity suggesting evolutionary significance were distilled from a text collection of many millions of words. Research contributions include: (1) An active replicator model of microevolutionary dynamics within natural language, (2) methods to distill active replicators offering evidence of evolutionary processes in action and at multiple linguistic levels (lexical, lexical co-occurrence, lexico-syntactic, and syntactic), (3) a demonstration that language evolution and organic evolution are both examples of a single over-arching evolutionary algorithm, (4) a set of tools to comparatively study language over time, and (5) methods to materially improve text retrieval.

        "text": "Music-listening systems When human listeners are confronted with musical sounds, they rapidly and automatically orient themselves in the music. Even musically untrained listeners have an exceptional ability to make rapid judgments about music from very short examples, such as determining the music's style, performer, beat, complexity, and emotional impact. However, there are presently no theories of music perception that can explain this behavior, and it has proven very difficult to build computer music-analysis tools with similar capabilities. This dissertation examines the psychoacoustic origins of the early stages of music listening in humans, using both experimental and computer-modeling approaches. The results of this research enable the construction of automatic machine-listening systems that can make human-like judgments about short musical stimuli. New models are presented that explain the perception of musical tempo, the perceived segmentation of sound scenes into multiple auditory images, and the extraction of musical features from complex musical sounds. These models are implemented as signal-processing and pattern-recognition computer programs, using the principle of understanding without separation. Two experiments with human listeners study the rapid assignment of high-level judgments to musical stimuli, and it is demonstrated that many of the experimental results can be explained with a multiple-regression model on the extracted musical features. From a theoretical standpoint, the thesis shows how theories of music perception can be grounded in a principled way upon psychoacoustic models in a computational-auditory-scene-analysis framework. Further, the perceptual theory presented is more relevant to everyday listeners and situations than are previous cognitive-structuralist approaches to music perception and cognition. From a practical standpoint, the various models form a set of computer signal-processing and pattern-recognition tools that can mimic human perceptual abilities on a variety of musical tasks such as tapping along with the beat, parsing music into sections, making semantic judgments about musical examples, and estimating the similarity of two pieces of music.

        "text": "Flexibility in building design : a real options approach and valuation methodology to address risk This research develops an approach to designing and valuing flexible systems subject to identified future uncertainties. The approach addresses two shortcomings of current design and decision-making practices that are particularly evident in the buildings industry: 1) systems are designed as though they will remain as static entities despite existing in uncertain environments, and 2) typical decision-making methods, such as net present value and life-cycle costing, do not recognize uncertainty and the ability to make decisions in the future as uncertainties are resolved. The flexible design approach produces an improved design result by addressing the risks and opportunities induced by uncertainty. Two applications relevant to sustainable building design are developed to demonstrate the approach. First, the value of the flexibility to change the use of a space, thereby increasing building longevity and reducing waste, is evaluated. Option value is defined as the savings of low renovations costs as compared to the cost of renting space on the market. Uncertainties include the market price of rent, timing, amount of space needed, and number of renovations. It is shown that higher upfront investment leading to reduced cost for future change is economically justified in certain scenarios. The value of flexibility increases with increased time horizon and increased uncertainty in the market price of rent. The Black-Scholes formula can be used to approximate the value of flexibility in some cases. Second, the risk of employing an innovative technology is addressed with a flexible design that provides a fallback position. (cont.) Specifically, the risk that a naturally ventilated (NV) building becomes overheated in the future due to climate uncertainty is addressed with an option to install mechanical cooling (MC). A model that simulates the system's technical performance under uncertainty demonstrates the value of the option. It is shown that in some locations, increased climate variability does not reduce the viability of NV (i.e., the option to install MC remains unexercised). The likelihood of installing MC is sensitive to design parameters. The results also demonstrate the benefits of the flexible, NV building as compared to MC: delayed or avoided capital costs (e.g., chillers) and cooling energy savings.
