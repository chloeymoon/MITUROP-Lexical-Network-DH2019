        "text": "Detection and characterization of rat hepatic stellate cells in a 3-dimensional, perfused, liver bioreactor One of the major challenges in liver research today lay in the understanding of the complex relationship between liver structure and function. The highly orchestrated events that take place in the liver to maintain homeostasis require the presence of all liver cell types. In vivo experiments offer only a snapshot of the liver, and usually involve perturbation of normal function through injury or experimental disease. The role of cell-cell interactions in maintaining normal liver function is far less understood than in pathological conditions. This may be because of the lack of methods in monitoring normal function in vivo. Culturing systems may capture pieces of the puzzle, but often capture only two cell types, and involve mediators presented to the cells in concentrations much higher than physiological values. In addition, the liver lobule contains a 3-dimensional metabolic zonation, and liver cell types comprise a heterogeneous population from the portal triad where the blood flows into the sinusoids to the central vein area where the blood flows out of the sinusoids. Liver cell types are dynamic responders to environmental cues from soluble factors to heterotypic cell interactions, to extracellular matrix proteins. Therefore, a system that serves to promote the health of all liver cell types through a 3-dimensional, perfused scaffold, and allows for self-organization of the liver cells in response to the engineered environment, would serve as a useful tool in understanding some of these complex, orchestrated events. In the research presented here, methods were developed to detect and characterize the heterogeneous population that makes up the hepatic stellate cell population inside the liver bioreactor (Griffith et. al). (cont.) This cell type, comprising a small percentage of total liver cells (approximately 5-10%), rapidly change their phenotype in response to liver injury, and, similarly, upon being taken out of the liver and cultured in 2-D on tissue culture plastic. This cell type plays a major role in relaying signals to and from both parenchymal and other nonparenchymal cells; stellate cells are also in charge of maintaining the components of the Space of Disse and are the key players in the pathology of liver fibrosis. They are found to be tightly complexed with sinusoidal endothelial cells and at the same time found to be tightly interacting with hepatocytes, sometimes even penetrating the hepatic plate. Stellate cell function, is therefore, highly dependent upon its interaction with other liver cells in maintaining the tightly knit structure-function relationship. For this reason, the liver bioreactor serves as a highly useful tool, in order to better understand the hepatic stellate cell's role in these complex situations. In this dissertation, detection and characterization methods are developed with the goal of capturing the heterogeneous stellate cell population as a whole with a toolbox of characterization markers, as well as to learn more about their functionality and location within tissue structures. These tools can be used to detect and characterize the population at various timepoints during tissue formation inside the bioreactor, as well as after exposure to physiologically-relevant concentrations of toxins, viruses, pharmaceuticals, etc. ...  The applications of comb polymer to the study of liver cell adhesion and signaling Comb polymer, which consists of a hydrophobic poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) backbone with hydrophilic hydroxy-poly(ethylene oxide) (HPOEM) side chains, is a tool that has many possible applications for the study of liver cell adhesion and signaling. This polymer has the unique properties of being cell resistant and chemically versatile such that various cell ligands can be coupled to its side chains. These properties allow adhesion through specific cell receptors to be studied without the effect of background adhesion to adsorbed proteins. By taking advantage of the ability to target specific receptors the comb polymer could be used as a powerful sorting tool. Sorting could be accomplished by finding cell type specific adhesion ligands. Several possible such ligands were screened. A ligand containing the tripeptide sequence RGD was found to elicit a strong cell adhesion response. However, this ligand is adherent to many cell types of the liver and would not be suitable for sorting purposes. Other cell type specific ligands tested showed little to no affinity for liver cell adhesion. Additionally, the comb was utilized to study α₅β₁ integrin-specific hepatocyte adhesion and the effect of Epidermal Growth Factor on adhesion. α₅β₁ integrin adhesion was mediated using a novel branched peptide, SynKRGD. This peptide consists of a linear peptide sequence containing RGDSP and the synergy site sequence PHSRN connected by the sequence GGKGGG. By utilizing the amine side group of Lysine a GGC branch was added. The terminal cysteine was used to conjugate SynKRGD to comb polymer surfaces using N-(p-Maleimidophenyl) isocyanate (PMPI) chemistry. EGF has a great potential to benefit the field of tissue engineering due to its influence on cell (cont.) proliferation, migration, and differentiation. EGF is also known to have a de-adhesive effect in some cell types. Hepatocytes were studied on comb surfaces of variable SynKRGD densities with and without the presence of EGF in the media. Distinct morphological differences were observed for hepatocytes on substrates of varying adhesivity with and without the presence of EGF. EGF was found to have a de-adhesive effect on α₅β₁ integrin adhesion in hepatocytes. This effect became more pronounced as substrate adhesiveness increased.

Development and characterization of an in vitro culture system as a physiological model for chronic Hepatitis B infection Human Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the prototype member of the family Hepadnaviridae that consists of enveloped, partially double stranded DNA viruses that specifically target hepatocytes for viral replication. Although a vaccine has been available for more than 20 years chronic HBV infection afflicts 350-400 million worldwide. It is estimated that 0.5-1.2 million people die each year from HBV-attributable cases of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Significant disadvantages exist among currently available therapeutics (e.g. IFNca, lamivudine, adefovir, etc.) that include limited efficacy and the promotion of drug-resistant viral strains. These therapeutics are the research products of the HBV molecular biology that can be manipulated in the laboratory setting. Future antiviral drug therapy is dependent upon the development of better cell culture systems that will allow the study of the complete viral life cycle. The use of primary human and primate hepatocytes is restricted by multiple experimental limitations including a rapid loss of susceptibility to infection in culture, lot-to-lot variability inherent in primary cell culture, and the necessity of treatment with chemical agents such as DMSO for reproducible infection. (cont.) Permissive cell lines are capable of supporting viral replication upon transfection with the HBV genome. These cell lines have helped to elucidate the later events in the viral life cycle. However, there is less understanding of the early stages that include virus attachment, internalization, uncoating, nuclear transport, and genome repair. Our group has developed an in vitro system that recreates many of the features of a perfused capillary bed structure. Various metrics (e.g. biochemical production, tissue morphology, liver-enriched mRNA expression, and drug metabolism) confirm that this system maintains a well-differentiated liver phenotype. Using DHBV as a surrogate model, this study has attempted to demonstrate that hepatocytes maintained in a more sophisticated culture system retain susceptibility to infection. This study has endeavored to establish the perfused three-dimensional culture system as potential tool to study early events of the viral life cycle. This research lays the foundation for the future development of a human HBV infection model in which early stages of the viral life cycle can be studied and therapeutic targets identified.  The roll of integrins in hematopoiesis Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) hold great promise for the treatment of disease. The rare frequency at which HSCs occur in the bone marrow under homeostatic conditions is a limiting factor in both their study and clinical use. ex vivo expansion of these cells is therefore a necessary step to maximizing their potential. In this thesis I explore the concept that signals from the extracellular matrix can direct differentiation, survival and self-renewal decisions in hematopoietic cells, and thus can provide a foundation for the design of ex vivo expansion strategies. This work is focused on the role integrins, the major class of cell-extracellular matrix adhesion molecules, play in mediating these signals to hematopoietic cells at two developmental stages. In the erythroid lineage, I show that expansion of committed erythroid progenitors is regulated by growth factor and integrin-mediated signals in temporally distinct regimes. I establish a biologically relevant role for [alpha]401 but not [alpha]501 integrins in erythropoiesis and provide evidence that erythroid differentiation and expansion are regulated by separate processes. (cont.) In the study of uncommitted HSCs, I identify several integrin subunits that are differentially expressed on highly purified HSC populations that correlate with long term repopulating ability. One of these subunits, [alpha]2 integrin, specifically mediates adhesion of HSCs to bone marrow extracellular matrix proteins, thereby providing a potential mechanism for stem cell self-renewal. This work establishes that integrin-mediated interactions between hematopoietic cells and the extracellular matrix are dynamic and provide important developmental cues.

Here, a simple technique was developed to create a robust microfluidics system capable of generating precise gradients of biochemical properties within its channels. Through this approach, it is possible to create a gradient generator with mammalian cells patterned and seeded under its poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) channels. Cells that were seeded and patterned under the PDMS channels remained viable and capable of performing intracellular reactions. Using the gradient generator within the PDMS microfluidic device, a gradient of specific and controlled biochemicals can be flowed on seeded cells allowing for high-throughput molecular interaction analysis. The microfluidics system provides a way to study and analyze cell response in the presence of a combination of biochemical signals.

The microfluidics system provides a way to study and analyze cell response in the presence of a combination of biochemical signals. Nanoscale and microscale approaches for engineering the in vitro cellular microenvironment Micro- and nanofabrication approaches have dramatically changed our society through their use in microelectronics and telecommunication industries. These engineering tools are also useful for many biological applications ranging from drug delivery to DNA sequencing, since they can be used to fabricate small features at a low cost and in a reproducible manner. The goal of this thesis was to develop techniques based on the merger of novel materials and nano and microfabrication approaches to manipulate cell microenvironment in culture. To control cell migration and to restrict cell or colony size, cells and proteins were patterned by using molding or printing methods. Poly(ethylene glycol)-based molecules and polysaccharides were used to control cell-substrate interactions and to prevent cell adhesion on specific regions of a substrate. To control cell-cell contact, layer-by-layer deposition of ionic biopolymers (i.e. negatively charged hyaluronic acid and positively charged poly-L-lysine) was used to generate patterned co-cultures. In addition, to control cell-soluble factor interactions, microfluidic-based approaches were developed. To pattern cells and proteins within microchannels, a soft lithographic method was developed to pattern microchannel substrates using printing and molding approaches. (cont.) To easily immobilize cells within channels, poly(ethylene glycol) microstructures were used to capture cells within low shear stress regions. These techniques also allowed for the fabrication of multiphenotype cell arrays. In addition, techniques were developed to control the interaction of cells within hydrogels by controlling the spatial properties of hydrogels.  Enhanced polymeric nanoparticles for gene delivery The potential of gene therapy to treat disease and improve human health is tremendous. The failure of viral gene therapy clinical trials due to toxicity, immunogenicity, and carcinogenicity has been tragic and strongly motivates a non-viral approach. However, non-viral gene delivery is currently ineffective. Here, we show that polymeric nanoparticles composed of poly([beta]-amino esters) (PBAEs) and DNA can be formulated to be stable in the presence of serum proteins and have high gene delivery without toxicity to human primary cells. The biophysical properties of PBAE/DNA nanoparticles have good correlation to transfection efficacy when tested in the appropriate media conditions. We also show that electrostatic interactions can drive peptide coating of nanoparticles and enable ligand-specific gene delivery. A biphasic efficacy relationship exists for peptide weight ratio, overall charge ratio, and ligand length, with intermediate values of coating being optimal. A balance is required when seeking to design nanoparticles that have reduced nonspecific uptake, but increased ligand-specific uptake. We develop a high-throughput assay to quantify polymer/DNA binding as a gene delivery bottleneck and find that a biphasic relationship exists between polymer/DNA binding constant, Ka, and delivery efficacy. We also show that end-modified PBAEs can be as effective as adenovirus for gene delivery. In comparison to the previous \"gold standard\" for polymeric transfection, 25 kDa polyethylenimine, the PBAE nanoparticles presented here have 100x higher efficacy while simultaneously having 100x lower toxicity. Small structural changes were found to have dramatic effects on multiple steps of gene delivery including the DNA binding affinity, nanoparticle size, intracellular DNA uptake, and final protein expression. (cont.) We show that small modifications to the termini of a polymer can significantly increase its in vivo activity and demonstrate potential utility of these polymers in the fields of cancer therapy, genetic vaccines, and stem cell engineering. As the enhanced polymeric gene delivery nanoparticles described here have many attractive properties over a virus including high safety, low immunogenicity, high nucleic acid cargo capacity, ease in manufacture, a coating method for targeted delivery, and flexibility for future design improvements, we believe that these polymeric nanoparticles may be promising alternatives for therapeutic gene delivery applications.

Peptide structures in solution were studied with circular dichroism and dynamic light scattering, and material properties of the peptide solutions were studied with rheology. Nanofiber structure was studied through atomic force microscopy. Sonication was found to have a minimal effect on KLD12, while pH could alter the length of the fibers formed. The presence of a second type of peptide in solution interacted with nanofibers of another peptide and resulted in a decrease of average fiber length. Peptide solutions transitioned from a viscous solution to a gel as the concentration of peptide increased, both alone and in mixture with another peptide.

The field of tissue engineering and organ regeneration has been born out of the high demand for organ transplants. However, one of the critical limitations in regeneration of vital organs is the lack of an intrinsic blood supply. This work expands on the development of microfluidic scaffolds for vascular tissue engineering applications by employing microfabrication techniques. Unlike previous efforts, this work focuses on fabricating this scaffolds from poly(glycerol-sebacate) (PGS), a novel biodegradable elastomer with superior mechanical properties. The transport properties of oxygen and carbon dioxide in PGS were measured through a series of time-lag diffusion experiments. The results of these measurements were used to calculate a characteristic length scale for oxygen diffusion limits in PGS scaffolds. Microfluidic scaffolds were then produced using fabrication techniques specific for PGS. Initial efforts have resulted in solid PGS-based scaffolds with biomimetic fluid flow and capillary channels on the order of 10 microns in width. These scaffolds have also been seeded with endothelial cells and perfused continuously in culture for up to 14 days resulting in partially confluent channels. More complex fabrication techniques were also demonstrated. A novel electrodeposition technique was used in the fabrication of biomimetic microfluidic masters. Thin-walled devices were also synthesized to accommodate the relatively low gas permeability of PGS.

Distribution of mutant cells in human skin : exploration of the fetal-juvenile mutability hypothesis The multiple \"hits\" carcinogenesis models are extensions of the cancer incidence theory developed by researchers from Nordling (1953), Armitage-Doll (1954 and 1957), Knudson (1971), Moolgavkar and Verzon (1979), to Moolgavkar and Knudson (1981), among others. These studies relate to the evolutionary process of normal tissue cells in an individual's organ from a normal stage to an initiated pre-neoplastic stage, and finally promoted to a neoplastic stage, resulting in tumorigenesis. The most significant impact of this type of research is to gain insight into the complex process of cancer development in humans. In the case of skin cancer, epidemiological and molecular data clearly indicate that sunlight is a carcinogen, the primary cause of skin cancer, in which forms of point mutation are associated with ultraviolet radiation. Furthermore, sunlight is attributed both as a tumor initiator and a tumor promoter by favoring the clonal expansion of p53 mutated cells. By utilizing studies of the multiple genetic hit model of oncomutation and inference that preneoplasia appears to be a clonal continuation of juvenile growth in adult tissues from which one stem cell creates an embryonic organ with lethal consequences, this thesis is devoted to the analysis of the process of skin cancer development and distribution of mutant cells in human skin, as well as the calculation of and inferences based on Gostjeva and Thilly's hypothesis on mutational clone frequency is restricted to the fetal-juvenile period. DNA polymerase beta inhibitor pamoic acid : toxicity to metakaryotic human cancer stem cells (HT-29) Amitotic cells with large, hollow bell-shaped nuclei, or metakaryotic stem cells, are the post-embryonic stem cells of the fetal organs from about the fourth week post conception through physical maturity. These metakaryotic stem cells, after acquiring necessary genetic, and possibly other events, are also the stem cells of precancerous, cancerous and metastatic lesions of carcinogenesis. Furthermore, our lab has discovered that metakaryotic stem cells, both in fetal development and tumor growth, use a peculiar mode of DNA synthesis and segregation that involves inter alia expression of large amounts of RNA polymerase beta during DNA synthesis. It was hypothesized that an inhibitor of DNA polymerase beta would be toxic to metakaryotic stem cells at concentrations lower than necessary to kill eukaryotic non stem cells. The polymerase beta small-molecule inhibitor chosen for this study was pamoic acid, a napthoic acid derivative. With it we determined the relative sensitivity of metakaryotes and eukaryotic cells in the human colorectal cancer cell culture, HT- 29mes, that expresses characteristics expected of colorectal cancer metastases. We conclude that, at 300 [mu]M and above pamoic acid does not selectively kill metakaryotes in cell culture below that concentration which kills eukaryotes. Rather, pamoic acid acts in a similar fashion as X-rays: eukaryotic non-stem cells are killed at lower doses than those that kill metakaryotic stem cells. Treatment of pamoic acid with these concentrations causes concomitant declines in colony-formation potential for both metakaryotes and eukaryotes alike. At lower overall survival levels, surviving colonies appear to have arisen from metakaryotic cells, not eukaryotic cells as evidenced by the presence of visible metakaryotic cells in most colonies and the ability of such colonies to support continuous growth upon passaging. We conclude with the possibility that this specific polymerase beta inhibitor is not an effective metakaryocide in culture, insofar as they are not selectively toxic for these stem cells in the HT-29mes colorectal cancer cell line.

Analysis of community cancer mortality rates Residents of small communities or neighborhoods often observe what appears to them to be an excessively high number of cancer cases. Some of these observations are brought to the attention of public health officials in the hope that an environmental cause within these communities may be discovered and subsequently eliminated. However, what appears to be a cluster of cancer cases locally may be a chance occurrence when viewed from the perspective of the entire state or region. The primary aim of this work was to obtain and analyze a data set of sufficient magnitude to provide a means to discover if distributions of cancer mortality rates among communities within a particular state, for any of the most common forms of cancer, were compatible with chance. To this end cancer mortality data for six of the largest states in the United States (California, Florida, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas) were collected, converted into mortality rates and analyzed to discover if the variations among communities could be accounted for by chance alone. These data comprised one third of all recorded deaths in the period of approximately 1969 to 1998. The 21 most common forms of adult and 6 most common forms of pediatric cancers were organized to permit analyses within each of the 6 states with regard to age (0-19, 65-84 and >/= 85 years), gender and ethnicity (European American and Non-European American descent). Key to this work was the mode of statistical analysis. For each community an expected mortality rate and its expected distribution was defined by the average mortality rate for all communities within each state and the binomial distribution, respectively. These expected distributions were summed for all communities to define the expected chance distribution of community mortality rates for each state, cancer, gender, age cohort and ethnicity. This produced nearly 800 separate \"chance\" distributions. Each of these was compared to the corresponding observed distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smimov statistical test. This test was designed to discover statistically significant differences between any two distributions. Here it was used to determine which of the nearly 800 observed distributions could not be accounted for by chance alone. Of these comparisons, 16 were found to have observed distributions significantly different from the expected by chance distributions. All 16 had distributions that exhibited greater dispersion than expected by chance, and none had distributions with less dispersion than the chance expectation. Point mutations in normal lungs of smokers and non-smokers It is a widely-held hypothesis that environmental mutagens play an essential role in human somatic and germinal cell mutagenesis. In particular, the finding of small amounts of chemical mutagens in cigarette smoke has led to the general hypothesis that mutagens in cigarette smoke induce oncomutations and thus account for the carcinogenic effect of cigarette smoking in human lungs. However, this hypothesis has not been tested by an assay of nuclear point mutations in lungs of smokers and nonsmokers. Mismatch amplification mutation assay (MAMA), an effective form of allele-specific PCR, was applied for detection of point mutations in TP53 bp742, bp746 and bp747, K-ras bp35 and HPRT bp508 from a total of 291 tracheal-bronchial epithelial sectors from six smokers and nine non-smokers, yielding 949 individual mutational assays. The conditions of MAMA for each target point mutations were optimized such that the sensitivity of each was equal to or below 10⁻⁵. Lung epithelial sectors of 2.3x10⁶ cells in average contained 0-200 mutant cells in general, equivalent to mutant fractions (MFs) of 0-10⁻⁴ with an exception of rare sectors with MF larger than 4x 10⁻⁴ (4.6%). Noticeably, the distributions of the MFs among sectors did not vary appreciably with the donor's smoking status. The mean MFs per lung were very similar between smokers and non-smokers for all five target mutations assayed (p >> 0.05). The mean MFs were slightly higher in females than males (p = 0.015). The mean MFs increased with age of the subjects although the correlation did not reach statistical significance due to large variances within the same age group. The distributions of MF among sectors of smokers and non-smokers did not differ significantly by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (cont.) for all target mutations but HPRT. By using hypothetical turnover unit sizes and Poisson distribution, the turnover unit size of human tracheal bronchial epithelium was estimated as 64 cells (p = 0.05). These observations do not support the widely-held hypothesis that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer through its induction of point mutations in nuclear genes. The current findings demonstrate the necessity of investigation on alternative mechanisms for tobacco smoke in lung carcinogenesis.  Inherited risk for common disease Linkage disequilibrium studies have discovered few gene-disease associations for common diseases. The explanation has been offered that complex modes of inheritance govern risk for cancers, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and diabetes. Such studies, however, depended on the untested assumption of monoallelic risk. My research advisor and I set out to investigate whether simple forms of inherited risk, monoallelic or multiallelic, could be excluded by analysis of familial risk for a common disease, such as colorectal cancer (CRC). First, we derived formulae that describe the risk for monogenic, multigenic, and polygenic possibilities of Mendelian inheritance. Next, we obtained an estimate of minimum lifetime risk for CRC of >0.26. Then, we examined the case of late-onset CRC, using the Swedish Family Cancer Database (1958-2002) to estimate the familial relative risk for CRC diagnosis at age 50 or older, and obtained an estimated range of 1.5 to 3.0. We compared this range of actual values to the ranges of expected values for monogenic, multigenic, and polygenic modes of inheritance. (cont.) We delimited bounds that can be placed on the conditions for various modes of inheritance. The key observation is that monogenic risk for CRC is included among various possibilities, and cannot be eliminated by existing observations. The arguments herein indicate that further efforts can and should be made to obtain more precise estimates of familial risk for CRC and other common forms of cancer.  Determination of the historical changes in primary and secondary risk factors for cancer using U.S. public health records Overall cancer mortality rates have risen from about 4% of all deaths in the early 20th century to about 25% of all deaths by the end of the century in the United States. To assess any potential hypotheses for this increase required knowledge of the mortality rate changes specific to each form of cancer, and the time points when these rates had changed. For this purpose, population and cancer mortality data of the U.S. were collected and organized to create age-specific mortality rates for each birth decade from the 1800s forward, delineated by the organ of incidence. Concurrently, cancer survival data were collected so as to correct for any effect of improved treatment on historical changes in cancer mortality rates. To analyze these data, a mathematical model for the three-stage process of carcinogenesis (initiation, promotion, and progression) was developed to estimate for each birth decade cohort the value of the fraction of the cohort at lifetime risk for that cancer, the value of the growth rate of the respective precancerous lesion, and the values for the mutation rates of normal and precancerous cells in the organ of incidence. This methodology permits the analysis of the potential historical effect of new chemical exposures during the last century on cancer mortality rates. These chemical exposures represent potential risk factors that determine the fraction of the population at risk of developing cancer (lifetime, primary risk factor), or that hasten death by cancer by altering either mutation or cell kinetic rates (accelerating, secondary risk factor.) (cont.) COLON CANCER: Application of this model on the colon cancer mortality data resulted in the estimate that 42% of the population in the U.S. was at risk for developing colon cancer, independent of gender or race. More importantly, there was no significant historical change in the calculated fraction at risk for birthyear cohorts from 1860 to 1940, suggesting that the primary risk factors for colon cancer are not environmental. Although direct observation of in vivo mutation rates of colonic cells does not yet exist, the calculated rate for the first initiation mutation in the colon was interestingly found to be similar to the mutation rate observed for the hprt locus in human peripheral T-cells (-2.1 x 10-7 per cell year) and the spontaneous mutation rate of the hprt locus of human B-cells in culture. The estimate for initiation mutation rates increased no more than two-fold from the birthyear cohort of 1860 to the birthyear cohort of 1940, except for European American females for which calculated initiation mutation rates were historically invariant, but since the accuracy of primary data for mortality rates and survival rates cannot be ascertained, the apparent small differences might admittedly arise from unknown biases. Evaluation of the parameter of the growth rate of precancerous lesions showed no significant historical change on this parameter. Curiously, the calculated doubling rate of these lesions (-0.17-0.21) was found to be similar to the growth rate of children, suggesting that the required initiation events have the net effect of potentially reactivating pathways involved in child development. (cont.) The predominant historical change in the observed mortality rates for colon cancer occurred only at old ages. ...  A clamp ligation method for point mutational spectrometry : marked increase in scanning range for the human genome The study of human mutagenesis requires methods of measuring somatic mutations in normal human tissues and inherited mutations in human populations. Such methods should permit measurement of rare mutations in the presence of abundant wild-type copies and should be general to the human genome. A sensitivity of 2 x 10-6 for point mutations was recently achieved in human cells using a novel method of target isolation, constant denaturant capillary electrophoresis (CDCE), and high-fidelity polymerase chain reaction (hifi-PCR) (Li-Sucholeiki and Thilly, 2000). This method is applicable to 100-base pair (bp) DNA domains juxtaposed with a naturally occurring domain of a higher melting temperature, or a natural clamp. Such sequence domains represent about 9% of the human genome. To permit analysis of rare point mutations in the human genome more generally, this thesis developed a procedure in which a clamp can be ligated to any 100-bp sequence of interest. This procedure was combined with the previous method to create a new method of point mutational analysis that is not dependent on a naturally occurring clamp. To demonstrate the new method, a sequence with a natural clamp, a part of the human hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) gene (cDNA-bp 223-318), was analyzed using both the natural and ligated clamps. A sensitivity of 2 x 10-5 in human cells was demonstrated using the ligated clamp as opposed to 5 x 10-6 using the natural clamp. (cont.) The sensitivity of the new method using the ligated clamp was demonstrated to be limited by the fidelity of Pfu DNA polymerase used for PCR. The sequence of the ligated clamp accounted for the differences in sensitivity as a result of causing a decreased efficiency of mutant enrichment by CDCE. The new method can be applied to measure somatic mutations in normal human tissues, such as lung tissues, in which point mutations at fractions above 10-5 have been observed. This method can also detect predominant inherited mutations even for genes carrying recessive deleterious alleles in pooled samples derived from a large number of individuals.

The explanation has been offered that complex modes of inheritance govern risk for cancers, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and diabetes. Such studies, however, depended on the untested assumption of monoallelic risk. My research advisor and I set out to investigate whether simple forms of inherited risk, monoallelic or multiallelic, could be excluded by analysis of familial risk for a common disease, such as colorectal cancer (CRC). First, we derived formulae that describe the risk for monogenic, multigenic, and polygenic possibilities of Mendelian inheritance. Next, we obtained an estimate of minimum lifetime risk for CRC of >0.26. Then, we examined the case of late-onset CRC, using the Swedish Family Cancer Database (1958-2002) to estimate the familial relative risk for CRC diagnosis at age 50 or older, and obtained an estimated range of 1.5 to 3.0. We compared this range of actual values to the ranges of expected values for monogenic, multigenic, and polygenic modes of inheritance. (cont.) We delimited bounds that can be placed on the conditions for various modes of inheritance. The key observation is that monogenic risk for CRC is included among various possibilities, and cannot be eliminated by existing observations. The arguments herein indicate that further efforts can and should be made to obtain more precise estimates of familial risk for CRC and other common forms of cancer.  Determination of the historical changes in primary and secondary risk factors for cancer using U.S. public health records Overall cancer mortality rates have risen from about 4% of all deaths in the early 20th century to about 25% of all deaths by the end of the century in the United States. To assess any potential hypotheses for this increase required knowledge of the mortality rate changes specific to each form of cancer, and the time points when these rates had changed. For this purpose, population and cancer mortality data of the U.S. were collected and organized to create age-specific mortality rates for each birth decade from the 1800s forward, delineated by the organ of incidence. Concurrently, cancer survival data were collected so as to correct for any effect of improved treatment on historical changes in cancer mortality rates. To analyze these data, a mathematical model for the three-stage process of carcinogenesis (initiation, promotion, and progression) was developed to estimate for each birth decade cohort the value of the fraction of the cohort at lifetime risk for that cancer, the value of the growth rate of the respective precancerous lesion, and the values for the mutation rates of normal and precancerous cells in the organ of incidence. This methodology permits the analysis of the potential historical effect of new chemical exposures during the last century on cancer mortality rates. These chemical exposures represent potential risk factors that determine the fraction of the population at risk of developing cancer (lifetime, primary risk factor), or that hasten death by cancer by altering either mutation or cell kinetic rates (accelerating, secondary risk factor.) (cont.) COLON CANCER: Application of this model on the colon cancer mortality data resulted in the estimate that 42% of the population in the U.S. was at risk for developing colon cancer, independent of gender or race. More importantly, there was no significant historical change in the calculated fraction at risk for birthyear cohorts from 1860 to 1940, suggesting that the primary risk factors for colon cancer are not environmental. Although direct observation of in vivo mutation rates of colonic cells does not yet exist, the calculated rate for the first initiation mutation in the colon was interestingly found to be similar to the mutation rate observed for the hprt locus in human peripheral T-cells (-2.1 x 10-7 per cell year) and the spontaneous mutation rate of the hprt locus of human B-cells in culture. The estimate for initiation mutation rates increased no more than two-fold from the birthyear cohort of 1860 to the birthyear cohort of 1940, except for European American females for which calculated initiation mutation rates were historically invariant, but since the accuracy of primary data for mortality rates and survival rates cannot be ascertained, the apparent small differences might admittedly arise from unknown biases. Evaluation of the parameter of the growth rate of precancerous lesions showed no significant historical change on this parameter. Curiously, the calculated doubling rate of these lesions (-0.17-0.21) was found to be similar to the growth rate of children, suggesting that the required initiation events have the net effect of potentially reactivating pathways involved in child development. (cont.) The predominant historical change in the observed mortality rates for colon cancer occurred only at old ages. ...  A clamp ligation method for point mutational spectrometry : marked increase in scanning range for the human genome The study of human mutagenesis requires methods of measuring somatic mutations in normal human tissues and inherited mutations in human populations. Such methods should permit measurement of rare mutations in the presence of abundant wild-type copies and should be general to the human genome. A sensitivity of 2 x 10-6 for point mutations was recently achieved in human cells using a novel method of target isolation, constant denaturant capillary electrophoresis (CDCE), and high-fidelity polymerase chain reaction (hifi-PCR) (Li-Sucholeiki and Thilly, 2000). This method is applicable to 100-base pair (bp) DNA domains juxtaposed with a naturally occurring domain of a higher melting temperature, or a natural clamp. Such sequence domains represent about 9% of the human genome. To permit analysis of rare point mutations in the human genome more generally, this thesis developed a procedure in which a clamp can be ligated to any 100-bp sequence of interest. This procedure was combined with the previous method to create a new method of point mutational analysis that is not dependent on a naturally occurring clamp. To demonstrate the new method, a sequence with a natural clamp, a part of the human hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) gene (cDNA-bp 223-318), was analyzed using both the natural and ligated clamps. A sensitivity of 2 x 10-5 in human cells was demonstrated using the ligated clamp as opposed to 5 x 10-6 using the natural clamp. (cont.) The sensitivity of the new method using the ligated clamp was demonstrated to be limited by the fidelity of Pfu DNA polymerase used for PCR. The sequence of the ligated clamp accounted for the differences in sensitivity as a result of causing a decreased efficiency of mutant enrichment by CDCE. The new method can be applied to measure somatic mutations in normal human tissues, such as lung tissues, in which point mutations at fractions above 10-5 have been observed. This method can also detect predominant inherited mutations even for genes carrying recessive deleterious alleles in pooled samples derived from a large number of individuals.  Analysis of community cancer mortality rates Residents of small communities or neighborhoods often observe what appears to them to be an excessively high number of cancer cases. Some of these observations are brought to the attention of public health officials in the hope that an environmental cause within these communities may be discovered and subsequently eliminated. However, what appears to be a cluster of cancer cases locally may be a chance occurrence when viewed from the perspective of the entire state or region. The primary aim of this work was to obtain and analyze a data set of sufficient magnitude to provide a means to discover if distributions of cancer mortality rates among communities within a particular state, for any of the most common forms of cancer, were compatible with chance. To this end cancer mortality data for six of the largest states in the United States (California, Florida, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas) were collected, converted into mortality rates and analyzed to discover if the variations among communities could be accounted for by chance alone. These data comprised one third of all recorded deaths in the period of approximately 1969 to 1998. The 21 most common forms of adult and 6 most common forms of pediatric cancers were organized to permit analyses within each of the 6 states with regard to age (0-19, 65-84 and >/= 85 years), gender and ethnicity (European American and Non-European American descent). Key to this work was the mode of statistical analysis. For each community an expected mortality rate and its expected distribution was defined by the average mortality rate for all communities within each state and the binomial distribution, respectively. These expected distributions were summed for all communities to define the expected chance distribution of community mortality rates for each state, cancer, gender, age cohort and ethnicity. This produced nearly 800 separate \"chance\" distributions. Each of these was compared to the corresponding observed distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smimov statistical test. This test was designed to discover statistically significant differences between any two distributions. Here it was used to determine which of the nearly 800 observed distributions could not be accounted for by chance alone. Of these comparisons, 16 were found to have observed distributions significantly different from the expected by chance distributions. All 16 had distributions that exhibited greater dispersion than expected by chance, and none had distributions with less dispersion than the chance expectation. Monogenic, multigenic, and polygenic determinants of cancer risk A formal series of conditions of lifetime genetic risk of cancer is explored, and algebra is provided for applications in human population genetics. Risks are considered in terms of alleles necessary and/or sufficient for carcinogenesis. Alleles are first classified with respect to their effects on reproductive fitness, and then in terms of their potential effects on carcinogenic pathways. The algebraic formulations for a series of genetic possibilities: monogenic, multigenic, and polygenic, are provided. It is expected that technology will be developed to identify and enumerate rare inherited alleles in large general and cancer proband populations. Point mutations in normal lungs of smokers and non-smokers It is a widely-held hypothesis that environmental mutagens play an essential role in human somatic and germinal cell mutagenesis. In particular, the finding of small amounts of chemical mutagens in cigarette smoke has led to the general hypothesis that mutagens in cigarette smoke induce oncomutations and thus account for the carcinogenic effect of cigarette smoking in human lungs. However, this hypothesis has not been tested by an assay of nuclear point mutations in lungs of smokers and nonsmokers. Mismatch amplification mutation assay (MAMA), an effective form of allele-specific PCR, was applied for detection of point mutations in TP53 bp742, bp746 and bp747, K-ras bp35 and HPRT bp508 from a total of 291 tracheal-bronchial epithelial sectors from six smokers and nine non-smokers, yielding 949 individual mutational assays. The conditions of MAMA for each target point mutations were optimized such that the sensitivity of each was equal to or below 10⁻⁵. Lung epithelial sectors of 2.3x10⁶ cells in average contained 0-200 mutant cells in general, equivalent to mutant fractions (MFs) of 0-10⁻⁴ with an exception of rare sectors with MF larger than 4x 10⁻⁴ (4.6%). Noticeably, the distributions of the MFs among sectors did not vary appreciably with the donor's smoking status. The mean MFs per lung were very similar between smokers and non-smokers for all five target mutations assayed (p >> 0.05). The mean MFs were slightly higher in females than males (p = 0.015). The mean MFs increased with age of the subjects although the correlation did not reach statistical significance due to large variances within the same age group. The distributions of MF among sectors of smokers and non-smokers did not differ significantly by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (cont.) for all target mutations but HPRT. By using hypothetical turnover unit sizes and Poisson distribution, the turnover unit size of human tracheal bronchial epithelium was estimated as 64 cells (p = 0.05). These observations do not support the widely-held hypothesis that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer through its induction of point mutations in nuclear genes. The current findings demonstrate the necessity of investigation on alternative mechanisms for tobacco smoke in lung carcinogenesis.

In the WT, the response was restricted to a transient repression of fundamental biochemical processes. Interestingly, a gene whose repression is known to mimic apoptosis was found to be repressed in the WT. The overwhelming induction of ribosomal protein synthesis genes in both WT and mgtl in response to MNNG is an unexpected result that could signify a successful recovery following wide-spread cellular damage. Damage to DNA can occur by means of endogenous biochemical processes or exogenous chemicals such as alkylating agents. If left unrepaired, alkylated bases, most notably, O⁶ Methylguanine (O⁶MeG) can be mutagenic and cytotoxic to the cell. Luckily, DNA methyltransferase (encoded by the gene MGT1 in yeast), repairs this damage. By using transcriptional profiling as a tool, an attempt to elucidate the role of MGT1 has been made. First, the basal expression profile of the mgtl was established. Then, the response of wild-type (WI) yeast and yeast lacking MGT1 (mgt1) to the alkylating agent, MNNG was studied using exponentially growing WT and mgti cultures which were exposed to 30[mu]g/ml of MNNG for 10 to 60 minutes. Basal expression profile of yeast lacking MGT1 showed up-regulation of RETV7, a gene implicated in spontaneous mutagenesis. Response to MNNG was invoked immediately and was dramatic and widespread involving 30% of the genome in both WT and mgt1. Cell-cycle checkpoints, damage signal amplifiers, DNA repair genes (nucleotide excision repair, photoreactive repair, mismatch repair) and chromatin remodeling genes were induced. Genes involved in maintaining mitochondrial structure and mitochondrial genome were also induced. Intriguingly, RPN4, a key regulator of proteasomal system was found to be repressed. Environmental stress response genes were culled out to examine the effects of MNNG on WT and mgtl, more carefully. Temporal gene expression profiles in WT and mgtl were informative in delineating differences in the distinct responses mounted by WT and mgtl. The magnitude of response in mgt1 is more profound than in WT. The differences in the dynamic trends between the two suggest that mgt1 initiates a coordinated response involving repression  High-throughput genomic phenotyping In the wake of the development of technology to sequence the complete genome of an organism, it has become expedient to generate methodologies to elucidate and characterize the function of all genes constituting the complete genetic makeup of an organism, whereby the knowledge of the genetic code may be for scientific and intellectual profit. This work consists of an investigation into two possible methods for determining the role of genes involved in the DNA and cellular damage response, though the methods are generally applicable to investigating a wide variety of biological pathways and responses. A library of approximately 4,800 yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) deletion strains produced by the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project and consisting essentially of all possible mutants having one non-essential gene deleted (and replaced with unique identification tags called \"bar codes\") from the genome are employed in this endeavor. The methods focus on gathering phenotype data in a high-throughput manner and in response to the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). The first method makes use of a new technology called the Living ChipTM, which can hold libraries of compounds or cell cultures in an array of 50-nl channels and which could ideally accommodate all deletion strains on a single array. The second method involves pooling all strains together in a single culture and allowing them to grow competitively to determine their relative fitness based on a specific treatment. A study of inter-individual differences in the DNA damage response Agents that damage our DNA are omnipresent in our environment and inside our cells themselves. Left unrepaired, DNA damage can lead to premature aging, neurodegeneration and cancer. Humans have thus evolved intricate and widespread mechanisms to repair and manage this damage. These mechanisms-called the DNA damage response-often involve cell cycle arrest. Cell cycle arrest gives the cells precious extra time to utilize its diverse set of repair pathways. Among these is the homologous recombination pathway, which repairs DNA double-strand breaks. When the damage is deemed irreparable, a cell can choose to die: this allows for the maintenance of genomic integrity of the organism. Humans share 99.9% of the same genetic information. The remaining 0.1% is responsible for all genetic variations between individuals. This includes differences in disease susceptibility. In this study, we examined the inter-individual differences in the DNA damage response. To do so, we used a panel of twenty-four B lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from twenty-four healthy individuals of diverse ancestries. This panel had already been shown to display a broad range of sensitivity to several DNA damaging agents. We focused our attention on the alkylating agents temozolomide and methylnitronitrosoguanidine (MNNG). While MNNG has been extensively studied as a model DNA damaging drug, temozolomide is used in the clinic today to treat astrocytoma and glioblastomas. The two drugs are often referred to as functional analogues. We wanted to see if the cell lines' relative sensitivities to both drugs would be similar, which would support the analogy made between the drugs, or different, which would refute it. Furthermore, we measured the amounts of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) induced by temozolomide treatment to determine if the sensitivity measured by growth inhibition post-treatment was correlated with the amount of temozolomide-induced SCEs. For the cell lines tested, we found that the MNNG-induced sensitivity was similar to that induced by temozolomide. We also found a cell line in which temozolomide induced a large growth inhibition, all the while inducing no detectable SCEs.

Damage to DNA can occur by means of endogenous biochemical processes or exogenous chemicals such as alkylating agents. If left unrepaired, alkylated bases, most notably, O⁶ Methylguanine (O⁶MeG) can be mutagenic and cytotoxic to the cell. Luckily, DNA methyltransferase (encoded by the gene MGT1 in yeast), repairs this damage. By using transcriptional profiling as a tool, an attempt to elucidate the role of MGT1 has been made. First, the basal expression profile of the mgtl was established. Then, the response of wild-type (WI) yeast and yeast lacking MGT1 (mgt1) to the alkylating agent, MNNG was studied using exponentially growing WT and mgti cultures which were exposed to 30[mu]g/ml of MNNG for 10 to 60 minutes. Basal expression profile of yeast lacking MGT1 showed up-regulation of RETV7, a gene implicated in spontaneous mutagenesis. Response to MNNG was invoked immediately and was dramatic and widespread involving 30% of the genome in both WT and mgt1. Cell-cycle checkpoints, damage signal amplifiers, DNA repair genes (nucleotide excision repair, photoreactive repair, mismatch repair) and chromatin remodeling genes were induced. Genes involved in maintaining mitochondrial structure and mitochondrial genome were also induced. Intriguingly, RPN4, a key regulator of proteasomal system was found to be repressed. Environmental stress response genes were culled out to examine the effects of MNNG on WT and mgtl, more carefully. Temporal gene expression profiles in WT and mgtl were informative in delineating differences in the distinct responses mounted by WT and mgtl. The magnitude of response in mgt1 is more profound than in WT. The differences in the dynamic trends between the two suggest that mgt1 initiates a coordinated response involving repression  High-throughput genomic phenotyping In the wake of the development of technology to sequence the complete genome of an organism, it has become expedient to generate methodologies to elucidate and characterize the function of all genes constituting the complete genetic makeup of an organism, whereby the knowledge of the genetic code may be for scientific and intellectual profit. This work consists of an investigation into two possible methods for determining the role of genes involved in the DNA and cellular damage response, though the methods are generally applicable to investigating a wide variety of biological pathways and responses. A library of approximately 4,800 yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) deletion strains produced by the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project and consisting essentially of all possible mutants having one non-essential gene deleted (and replaced with unique identification tags called \"bar codes\") from the genome are employed in this endeavor. The methods focus on gathering phenotype data in a high-throughput manner and in response to the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). The first method makes use of a new technology called the Living ChipTM, which can hold libraries of compounds or cell cultures in an array of 50-nl channels and which could ideally accommodate all deletion strains on a single array. The second method involves pooling all strains together in a single culture and allowing them to grow competitively to determine their relative fitness based on a specific treatment. Transcriptional response of O⁶-methylguanine methyltransferase deficient yeast to methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) (cont.) of transcription factors and subsequently, induction of RNA processing (35% of genes incrementally induced) and kinases involved in protein phosphorylation.

These cells come from the pre-implantation embryo, whose native environment is the hypoxic mammalian reproductive tract. Growing stem cells in an environment with higher oxygen levels (i.e. the atmospheric oxygen levels that are normally used to cultivate stem cells) could be bad for the cells, as oxygen is toxic due to its powerful oxidative capacity. In this experiment, J1 murine embryonic stem cells were grown at 0%, 2%, 5%, 10%, and 20% oxygen by volume to assess the effects that lower oxygen levels have on stem cell growth, plating efficiency, and metabolism. Two reaction vessels were built so that the cells could be grown in a controlled environment. Premixed gas cylinders were used to flush the vessels and an optical probe was used to measure the headspace oxygen concentration. Cells were found to grow faster than atmospheric conditions when in a moderately hypoxic environment where the oxygen concentration was between 2% and 10%, and considerably slower than atmospheric conditions as the headspace oxygen concentration approached zero. Maximum cell density decreased, glucose-lactate yield increased, glucose-cell yield decreased, and glutamine-cell yield decreased as headspace oxygen decreased. There were no strong correlations between oxygen concentration and glutamine-ammonia yield or plating efficiency. From the results of this study, it appears that it may be preferable to grow murine embryonic stem cells in a moderately hypoxic environment around 10% oxygen to increase the growth rate while minimizing the maximum cell density and metabolic inefficiency compromises.

        "text": "Fundamental differentiation and growth characterization of murine embryonic stem cells in varied culture conditions Although embryonic stem (ES) cells and their pluripotent capability have been elucidated for decades, little study has been done on obtaining the pluripotency profile of ES cells in the incipient stages of differentiation. In this research, an ES cell line with transfected green fluorescent protein (GFP) co-expressed by an Oct-4 promoter was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) to obtain such profile. As Oct-4 is an ES cell differentiation marker whose expression varies with pluripotency, GFP expression could simply be measured in these cells to determine how pluripotent they are as a population. The differentiation characterization of ES cells was also conducted with different culture conditions of reduced serum and glucose concentrations both in the presence and absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) which prevents spontaneous differentiation, as well as at varied LIF concentrations and seeding densities. In addition, fundamental growth kinetic and metabolic profiles were obtained to get a more complete picture of how ES cells behave under these varied culturing conditions. The doubling time (t[sub]d) of R1 Oct4-GFP cell line was found to be 13 hours in LIF⁺ culture and 8 hours in culture with LIF addition after 7 days of LIF withdrawal, implying that cell proliferation rate is higher for cells receiving a sudden upregulation of genes controlling cell division through LIF addition. Although the upregulation of the genes is rapid, the downregulation of these genes through LIF withdrawal was found to take 6-7 days, while 3-4 days were required to downregulate the pou5f gene (which controls Oct4 expression). Higher concentration of LIF resulted in higher ES cell proliferation rate, but GFP⁺ expression was unaffected by (cont.) concentration. Higher seeding density resulted in greater improvement in GFP⁺ expression for LIF⁺ culture but lower non significant reduction in GFP⁺ expression in LIF⁻ culture. Low level of glucose in medium led to reduction in the rate of ES cellular mechanisms and lower Y[sub]lac/gluc (8-49 % versus 40-60 % in high glucose), but metabolic rates were consistent with cells grown in high glucose medium, implying more efficient glucose metabolism through oxidative phosphorylation. The level of serum in medium had no effect on GFP⁺ expression or cell proliferation rate in LIF⁺ cultures, but reduction in GFP⁺ expression level was higher and t[sub]d was longer in low-serum culture (71 [plus-minus] 33 hours versus 35 [plus-minus] 9 hours) in the absence of LIF.  Fundamental differentiation and growth characterization of murine embryonic stem cells in varied culture conditions Although embryonic stem (ES) cells and their pluripotent capability have been elucidated for decades, little study has been done on obtaining the pluripotency profile of ES cells in the incipient stages of differentiation. In this research, an ES cell line with transfected green fluorescent protein (GFP) co-expressed by an Oct-4 promoter was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) to obtain such profile. As Oct-4 is an ES cell differentiation marker whose expression varies with pluripotency, GFP expression could simply be measured in these cells to determine how pluripotent they are as a population. The differentiation characterization of ES cells was also conducted with different culture conditions of reduced serum and glucose concentrations both in the presence and absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) which prevents spontaneous differentiation, as well as at varied LIF concentrations and seeding densities. In addition, fundamental growth kinetic and metabolic profiles were obtained to get a more complete picture of how ES cells behave under these varied culturing conditions. The doubling time (t[sub]d) of R1 Oct4-GFP cell line was found to be 13 hours in LIF⁺ culture and 8 hours in culture with LIF addition after 7 days of LIF withdrawal, implying that cell proliferation rate is higher for cells receiving a sudden upregulation of genes controlling cell division through LIF addition. Although the upregulation of the genes is rapid, the downregulation of these genes through LIF withdrawal was found to take 6-7 days, while 3-4 days were required to downregulate the pou5f gene (which controls Oct4 expression). Higher concentration of LIF resulted in higher ES cell proliferation rate, but GFP⁺ expression was unaffected by (cont.) concentration. Higher seeding density resulted in greater improvement in GFP⁺ expression for LIF⁺ culture but lower non significant reduction in GFP⁺ expression in LIF⁻ culture.

        "text": "A central composite design to investigate antibody fragment production by Pichia pastoris This study aims to investigate the relationships between growth parameters (agitation, glycerol concentration, salt concentration) and responses (biomass, growth rate, protein expression), by a 3-factor-3-level central composite factorial design. This experimental design involved running shake flask culture at 15 different experimental conditions with duplicates. Optical density (OD600), dry cell weight (DCW), and BCA Protein Assays were done on each experiment. Mathematical models in terms of these parameters' effects and their interactions were proposed for each of the responses. The significance of each effect and interaction, as well as the goodness-of-fit of mathematical models to data were examined by analysis of variance. It was found that biomass (with R²Adj=0.951) is a strong function of glycerol concentration (higher glycerol concentration leads to higher biomass), but it varies much less with agitation, and it is completely independent of salt concentration. Growth rate (R²Adj=0.901), however, varies strongly with agitation and salt concentration, but much more weakly with glycerol concentration. Protein production has a low R²Adj value of 0.746, implying that higher-order terms, e.g. x₁² and x₂², should be tested for significance in the model. (cont.) Collected data were fitted to the proposed models by response surface regression, after which surface and contour plots of responses were generated to identify trends in them. High agitation (300 rpm in shaker) gave rise to both highest biomass and growth rate. In addition, biomass at high glycerol concentration (3% v/v) was almost twice as much as biomass at low glycerol concentration (1% v/v) at high agitation rate (19 g/L compared to 11 g/L). At the same agitation rate, growth rate shows the largest increase of 20.5% with increasing salt concentration from 0.7% to 2.1%. Protein production reached maximum of 7.3 mg/mL at medium agitation rate (250 rpm), high salt and glycerol concentrations.  Optimization of cell adhesion environments for a liver cell bioreactor The MilliF bioreactor offers great potential for the formation of i vivo-like liver tissue outside the body, making it a valuable tool for applications such as drug toxicity models and biosensors. Cell adhesion is an important factor in the maintenance of differentiated hepatocyte functions. Hepatocyte adhesion environments were examined in two settings: spheroid culture prior to seeding in the bioreactor and 2D surface culture methods that could be applied to the bioreactor scaffold. Spheroids were formed either by culturing in spinning suspension or on a static, non-adherent surface. In spheroid culture, the addition of extracellular matrix (ECM) signaling through the use of soluble Matrigel or adhesion protein-coated microspheres did not improve hepatocyte viability or function as assessed by liver-specific gene expression. These results suggest the importance of cell-cell rather than cell-surface interactions in maintaining hepatocytes. Optimal culturing of spheroids in spinning suspension without the ECM addition was found to be 3 days without media changes. 2D surfaces were treated with an adhesion peptide-conjugated comb polymer, preventing nonspecific cell adhesion and allowing attachment through the [alpha]₅[beta]₁ integrin. (cont.) Varying the proportion of adhesion peptide presented to cells was found to regulate hepatocyte morphology and function; a surface with decreased hepatocyte spreading and liver-specific gene expression closer to in vivo was characterized. Immunoblotting for activated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) revealed that FAK signaling was not induced by attachment to the comb polymer surfaces. Immunostaining for other liver cell types demonstrated that the surface allowed hepatic stellate cell and Kupffer cell adhesion.  Investigating the role of calcium in the biomechanical response of neutrophils to mechanical deformation experienced in the pulmonary capillaries Neutrophils in the pulmonary microcirculation are subjected to mechanical deformation while traveling through capillaries of sizes much smaller than the mean neutrophil diameter. This deformation has been shown to result in significant reductions in both the shear storage and shear loss moduli of the cell, with subsequent recovery towards their initial values. Also, deformation above a threshold stimulus results in neutrophil activation, evidenced by pseudopod projection from the cell. These two events are thought to occur via independent pathways, yet little is known about the mechanosensing signaling involved. Other work has demonstrated that physiological deformation of neutrophils induces a marked increase in the levels of cytosolic calcium, suggesting that this occurrence may trigger the biomechanical response observed in the cell. The aim of this thesis was to elucidate the role of calcium in the neutrophil response to the mechanical deformation experienced during transit through the pulmonary capillaries. (cont.) Chelating intracellular calcium in neutrophils resulted in (i) decreased deformability of the cells into a microchannel, (ii) attenuation of the drop in shear storage modulus (G') observed in untreated cells upon deformation, and (iii) shorter activation times. These findings suggest that cytosolic calcium holds an important function in the neutrophil transit through the capillaries, and inhibition of normal calcium release within the cell can lead to leukostasis-like conditions.  Towards a microfluidic disease detection deviced based on cellular adhesion differences There is a great need in the fields of biology, medicine, and pharmaceuticals to create high-throughput devices for the detection of specific cell states in a heterogeneous mixture of cells. The desire is to differentiate among diseased and healthy cells, cell age, and cell type with the minimum amount of sample pretreatment. This project addresses this need by developing microfluidic devices that exploit the adhesion differences between cell states and cell types to rapidly count cells of different types without the need for labels. There are two avenues in which to explore cell adhesion differences with these devices, the first is a net electrostatic change at the surface of the cell wall and the second is the presence of specific cell-membrane adhesion proteins. It is hypothesized that the forced interaction of the cell wall with the microfabricated microcapillary walls would result in a differential velocity based on cell type that could be detected simply using a microscope and video camera or an interferometer. The eventual integration of cell velocity detection would result in a portable all-inclusive lab-on-a-chip system that could be used in the field for detecting the presence of diseases, such as malaria and cancer as well as in a lab setting for drug discovery. Dendritic cell maturation and activation via RNA/DNA danger signals : co-delivery of protein antigen with siRNA or CpG DNA Traditional vaccines consisting of live attenuated pathogens or inactivated toxins cannot be readily applied to the more challenging diseases of the present e.g. hepatitis C and the human immunodeficiency virus. As such, there is a need to develop new methods of priming the immune system against such foreign invaders. Recombinant protein subunits and peptides are relatively safe alternatives to live attenuated pathogens. However, these antigens are poorly immunogenic when administered alone in solution form and thus require the use of an adjuvant. To this end, we have developed a hydrogel-based nanoparticulate system to encapsulate protein antigen and to co-deliver it with DNA/RNA-based adjuvants to dendritic cells, the key antigen presenting cells in primary immune responses. Using CpG oligonucleotides or siRNA as adjuvants, we observed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for interleukin 12 and interferon-[alpha], respectively, that DCs were activated by CpG oligonucleotide- and siRNA-functionalized nanoparticles [approx.]10-fold more potently than by soluble CpG or siRNA ligands. Synthesis and error correction methods in gene fabrication Gene Fabrication technology involves the development and optimization of methods relevant to the in vitro synthesis of any given target gene sequence(s) in the absence of template. The driving purpose of this field of research is to bring about the capability for on-demand fabrication of a DNA construct of arbitrary length and sequence quickly, efficiently, and cost-effectively. The first part of this document describes many of the important considerations in performing successful de novo gene synthesis from a survey of the literature as well as from our own work. Recommendations are made for a universally effective, robust, and simple protocol for potential users of gene synthesis, discussing important factors such as choice of protocol, source of commercial oligonucleotides, and polymerase choice. The second part of this document focuses on error correction. Reducing error rates is one of the main challenges in gene fabrication because high error rates preclude the possibility of fabricating long gene targets in a practical and economical manner. Improvements in error rates are essential for continued progress in the development of gene fabrication technology. I discuss the importance of error rate in gene synthesis from a practical standpoint and show results in the development of novel methods for the removal of errors from a pool of synthesized DNA. A central composite design to investigate antibody fragment production by Pichia pastoris This study aims to investigate the relationships between growth parameters (agitation, glycerol concentration, salt concentration) and responses (biomass, growth rate, protein expression), by a 3-factor-3-level central composite factorial design. This experimental design involved running shake flask culture at 15 different experimental conditions with duplicates. Optical density (OD600), dry cell weight (DCW), and BCA Protein Assays were done on each experiment. Mathematical models in terms of these parameters' effects and their interactions were proposed for each of the responses. The significance of each effect and interaction, as well as the goodness-of-fit of mathematical models to data were examined by analysis of variance. It was found that biomass (with R²Adj=0.951) is a strong function of glycerol concentration (higher glycerol concentration leads to higher biomass), but it varies much less with agitation, and it is completely independent of salt concentration. Growth rate (R²Adj=0.901), however, varies strongly with agitation and salt concentration, but much more weakly with glycerol concentration. Protein production has a low R²Adj value of 0.746, implying that higher-order terms, e.g. x₁² and x₂², should be tested for significance in the model. (cont.) Collected data were fitted to the proposed models by response surface regression, after which surface and contour plots of responses were generated to identify trends in them. High agitation (300 rpm in shaker) gave rise to both highest biomass and growth rate. In addition, biomass at high glycerol concentration (3% v/v) was almost twice as much as biomass at low glycerol concentration (1% v/v) at high agitation rate (19 g/L compared to 11 g/L). At the same agitation rate, growth rate shows the largest increase of 20.5% with increasing salt concentration from 0.7% to 2.1%. Protein production reached maximum of 7.3 mg/mL at medium agitation rate (250 rpm), high salt and glycerol concentrations.  Optimization of cell adhesion environments for a liver cell bioreactor The MilliF bioreactor offers great potential for the formation of i vivo-like liver tissue outside the body, making it a valuable tool for applications such as drug toxicity models and biosensors. Cell adhesion is an important factor in the maintenance of differentiated hepatocyte functions. Hepatocyte adhesion environments were examined in two settings: spheroid culture prior to seeding in the bioreactor and 2D surface culture methods that could be applied to the bioreactor scaffold. Spheroids were formed either by culturing in spinning suspension or on a static, non-adherent surface. In spheroid culture, the addition of extracellular matrix (ECM) signaling through the use of soluble Matrigel or adhesion protein-coated microspheres did not improve hepatocyte viability or function as assessed by liver-specific gene expression. These results suggest the importance of cell-cell rather than cell-surface interactions in maintaining hepatocytes. Optimal culturing of spheroids in spinning suspension without the ECM addition was found to be 3 days without media changes. 2D surfaces were treated with an adhesion peptide-conjugated comb polymer, preventing nonspecific cell adhesion and allowing attachment through the [alpha]₅[beta]₁ integrin. (cont.) Varying the proportion of adhesion peptide presented to cells was found to regulate hepatocyte morphology and function; a surface with decreased hepatocyte spreading and liver-specific gene expression closer to in vivo was characterized. Immunoblotting for activated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) revealed that FAK signaling was not induced by attachment to the comb polymer surfaces. Immunostaining for other liver cell types demonstrated that the surface allowed hepatic stellate cell and Kupffer cell adhesion.  Investigating the role of calcium in the biomechanical response of neutrophils to mechanical deformation experienced in the pulmonary capillaries Neutrophils in the pulmonary microcirculation are subjected to mechanical deformation while traveling through capillaries of sizes much smaller than the mean neutrophil diameter. This deformation has been shown to result in significant reductions in both the shear storage and shear loss moduli of the cell, with subsequent recovery towards their initial values. Also, deformation above a threshold stimulus results in neutrophil activation, evidenced by pseudopod projection from the cell. These two events are thought to occur via independent pathways, yet little is known about the mechanosensing signaling involved.

We aimed to test this hypothesis and to determine its validity across cancer cell types. In addition, we hoped to explain the involvement of certain kinases in nitric oxide-induced apoptosis. The experimental setup involved stimulating human colorectal cancer cells, HT-29 and HCT- 116, and human prostate cancer cells, LNCaP, with cytokines in order to induce cell death. Then, we observed the effects of NO inhibitors, kinase inhibitors, and activation of Akt, a kinase up-stream of the caspase cascade, following transfection of a DNA sequence that was proven to protect cells against apoptosis induction. In our series of experiments, inhibition of the nitric oxide synthases removes nitric oxide protection from apoptosis, but inhibition of only the inducible synthase has opposite effects with prostate and colon cancer cells that are considered insignificant, and its effects on the two types of colon cancer cells are in discord. Transformation and transfection of ARK5 into the colorectal cancer cell line, HT-29 did not prove beneficial. Similarly, glucosamine showed no clear pattern of reducing apoptosis in the cells. Therefore, we propose further exploration of the inhibition of constitutive nitric oxide synthases as a potential therapy.

        "text": "Investigation of growth factors and cytokines that suppress adult stem cell asymmetric cell kinetics Adult stem cells are potentially useful in many biomedical applications that can save lives and increase the quality of a patient's life, such as tissue engineering, cell replacement, and gene therapy. However, these applications are limited because of the difficulty in isolating and expanding pure populations of adult stem cells (ASCs). A major barrier to ASC expansion in vitro is their property of asymmetric cell kinetics. Our lab has developed a method, Suppression of Asymmetric Cell Kinetics (SACK), to expand ASCs in vitro by shifting their cell kinetics program from asymmetric to symmetric. We have found that guanine nucleotide precursors can be used to convert the kinetics of adult stem cells from asymmetric to symmetric, which promotes their exponential expansion. Previously, we have used the SACK method to derive hepatic and cholangiocyte stem cell strains from adult rat livers in vitro. These cell strains provide an assay to evaluate whether growth factors and cytokines previously implicated in proliferation of progenitor cells act by converting the kinetics of the stem cells in the population from asymmetric to symmetric, and thus identify new SACK agents. We are evaluating three agents, Wnt, IGF- 1, and Sonic hedgehog (Shh). (cont.) Wnt has been found to cause self-renewal and proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in vitro. IGF- 1 also plays a role in hematopoietic progenitor self-renewal in vivo as well as in tissue maturation. Shh has been implicated in the proliferation of primitive neural cells as well as in cellular proliferation during invertebrate development. Thus far, we have found that Wnt peptide shifts the cell kinetics from asymmetric to symmetric and may reduce the generation time, whereas IGF-1 appears only to affect generation time. Studies involving Shh are currently underway. We are also currently investigating whether Wnt acts additively or synergistically with guanine nucleotide precursors to shift cell kinetic symmetry. Discovering new SACK agents will allow us to obtain purer populations of ASCs that can be used to study properties unique to stem cells. Furthermore, the observation that Wnt shifts the kinetics of adult rat hepatic stem cells from asymmetric to symmetric implicates the involvement of similar cell kinetics symmetry mechanisms in the proliferation effect of Wnt on murine and human HSCs.

Physicochemical characterization of immortal strand DNA Adult tissue differentiation involves the generation of distinct cell types from adult stem cells (ASCs). Current understanding of tissue differentiation mechanisms is based on studies of protein and RNAs that asymmetrically segregate between daughter cells during embryogenesis. Whether or not other types of biomolecules segregate asymmetrically has not been widely studied. In 1975, John Cairns proposed that ASCs preferentially segregate the oldest parental template DNA strands to themselves and pass on newly replicated DNA strands to their differentiating progeny in order to protect the stem cell from inheriting DNA replication mutations. This laboratory has shown non-random chromosome segregation in murine fetal fibroblasts that model asymmetric self-renewal like ASCs. In these cells, chromosomes that contain the oldest DNA strands co-segregate to the cycling daughter stem-like cells, while chromosomes with more recently replicated DNA segregate to the non-stem cell daughters. Previously, cytological methods were reported to elucidate non-random segregation in these cells. This dissertation research provides additional confirmation of the mechanism using physicochemical methods. Specifically, buoyant density-shift experiments in equilibrium CsCl density gradients were used to detect co-segregated \"immortal DNA strands\" based on incorporation of the thymidine base analogue bromodeoxyuridine. In addition, DNA from cells undergoing non-random mitotic chromosome segregation was analyzed for unique DNA base modifications and global structural modifications (by HPLC and melting temperature analyses). To date, these studies show no significant differences compared to control randomly segregated DNA. Components of the mitotic chromosome separation (cont.) apparatus that might play a role in the co-segregation mechanism were also evaluated. Two homologous proteins, essential for proper chromosome segregation and cytokinesis, Aurora A kinase and Aurora B kinase, were highly reduced in expression in cells retaining immortal DNA strands and may indicate a role for them in the immortal strand mechanism. These studies independently confirm the immortal strand mechanism and provide methods for its detection in other cell lines. In addition, observed changes in chromosome segregation proteins that are potential candidates for involvement in the mechanism have revealed a new area of investigation in the laboratory. These findings are relevant to understanding normal tissue development, cancer, and aging.

        "text": "A novel nanodelivery system for combination tumor therapy Anti-angiogenic therapy offers many benefits over traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy including fewer toxic side effects and the reduced development of drug resistance. Anti-angiogenics alone have not proven effective in inducing tumor regression in the clinic due to both the cytostatic nature of anti-angiogenic therapy and the potential formation of new regions of hypoxia within the tumor after therapy. The new therapeutic paradigm is for combining both anti-angiogenics and traditional cytotoxic agents for a synergistic effect. The efficacy of cytotoxic agents may be reduced after anti-angiogenic therapy, however, due to limited access to tumor vasculature and hypoxia-induced drug resistance. We propose that loading cytotoxic agents within the tumor prior to blood vessel collapse will enable both greater drug accumulation within the tumor as well as a reduction in the formation of therapy-induced regions of hypoxia. We present here a novel nanodelivery vehicle termed a 'nanocell' for the spatio-temporal recruitment of both anti-angiogenics and cytotoxic agents within the solid tumor to achieve this goal. Nanocells consist of a polymeric nanocore encapsulating the cytostatic agent doxorubicin surrounded by a lipid vesicle containing the anti-angiogenic agent combretastatin A4. (cont.) Nanocell treatment resulted in an 88% reduction in tumor size in vivo, compared to a 66% reduction in tumor size after delivering combretastatin A4 lipid vesicles and doxorubicin nanocores simultaneously but separately. Nanocell treatment also resulted in a significant reduction in systemic toxicity, fewer metastases to the lung and liver, and a greater degree of tumor apoptosis.

Sequencing complex polysaccharides Glycosaminoglycans are complex polysaccharides that exist at the cell/extracellular matrix interface. As such, these information-dense molecules are key regulators of extracellular signals. However, to date, there has been a lack of effective biochemical and analytical tools for the analysis of glycosaminoglycan structure and hence, there is very little understanding of exactly how glycosaminoglycan structure impinges on function. Development of such tools is especially important for a key subset of glycosaminoglycans, i.e., heparin/heparan sulfate-like glycosaminoglycans (HLGAGs). As a first step in the development of tools to study HLGAG structure, biochemical studies were completed on the heparinases, a family of three HLGAG-degrading enzymes from Flavobacterium heparinum. With heparinase I, it was found that calcium is a necessary cofactor for optimal activity and that two putative calcium coordinating motifs exist in heparinase I. With heparinase II, a single cysteine and three histidines were found to be critical for proper enzymatic function. Finally, with heparinase III, two histidines were found to be catalytically important. (cont.) In addition to the development of the heparinases, sensitive analytical methodologies were developed to determine HLGAG structure. A novel mass spectrometric procedure was developed and used to define heparinase's II mechanism of action on defined oligosaccharide substrates. In addition, capillary electrophoresis, in combination with heparinase digestion, was used for the compositional analysis of HLGAG oligosaccharides. Coupling of these analytical techniques with a property-encoded nomenclature to handle the information density of HLGAGs enabled the development of a sequencing procedure for HLGAGs. These procedures were then used to probe a number of key biological processes that are mediated by HLGAGs. The sequencing approach developed herein was used to determine the structure of HLGAG oligosaccharides involved in hemostasis and viral binding. In addition, these approaches were used to probe HLGAG binding by clinically and biologically important signaling molecules, viz., fibroblast growth factor and endostatin. Together, these studies represent a foundation with which it possible to develop further HLGAG structure/function relationships, opening new avenues of research and making possible HLGAG-based therapeutics.  Glycosaminoglycan-protein interactions : the fibroblast growth factor paradigm Specific interactions between heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (HSGAGs) and proteins are central to a wide range of biological processes such as anticoagulation, angiogenesis and growth factor activation. The specificity involved in the HSGAG-protein interactions stems from the structural heterogeneity of HSGAGs, which are highly acidic biopolymers associated on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix. It is believed that structural specificity in the HSGAG-protein interactions determines the biological functions mediated by HSGAG-binding proteins such as basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2). A number of models have been proposed to account for the mode of FGF-FGFR interactions and the role of HSGAGs in modulating FGF2 signaling. It was hypothesized that one role played by HSGAGs was to stabilize FGF2 oligomers in a \"side-by-side\" or cis fashion for presentation to fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR). In this thesis research, we systematically examined different proposed modes of FGF2 dimerization and showed that extensive oligomerization of a FGF2 mutant protein could be achieved by oxidatively crosslinking. Heparin, a highly sulfated form of HSGAGs, was demonstrated to increase the extent of oligomerization. Therefore, the results reported here were consistent with the hypothesis that HSGAGs promoted FGF2 oligomerization in a \"side-by-side\" mode. The functional significance of a FGF2 dimer was tested using a genetically engineered dimeric FGF2 (dFGF2). Biochemical and biophysical properties of dFGF2, such as protein folding, heparin affinity and receptor (cont.) binding, were assayed. dFGF2 was found to exhibit higher activities in stimulating cell proliferation and cell survival in vitro compared with the monomeric wildtype. An in vivo rat cornea pocket model further corroborated the in vitro findings. The functional role of HSGAGs derived from the cell surface was studied here. It was found that distinct HSGAG fragments released by heparinase treatment were capable of modulating FGF2-stimulated cell proliferation depending on the expression of FGFR isoforms. This founding is consistent with the proposal that structural specificity of distinct HSGAG fragments dictated the interaction of HSGAGs with FGF and FGFR. The role of heparinase-generated HSGAG fragments in inhibiting cell proliferation was investigated. B16 melanoma cells treated with heparinase III were found to exhibit biochemical and morphological hallmarks of apoptosis. Conditioned medium derived from heparinase-treated cells was shown to be effective in suppressing cell growth. Gene array experiments and caspase activity assays further suggested that apoptotic cell death was mediated through a caspase 8-, death receptor-dependent pathway. Thus, the present study lends further credence to the proposal that cell surface HSGAGs plays a critical role in orchestrating cell phenotype. This thesis work provides the framework for understanding the molecular mechanism of growth factor activation and the structure-function relationship of HSGAG-mediated cell signaling. Results from this study may potentially be useful for therapeutic protein engineering and carbohydrate-based drug discovery.  Enzymatic and analytical tools for the characterization of chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate glycosaminoglycans Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are complex polysaccharides that reside in the extracellular matrix and on the surfaces of all cells. The same complexity that contributes to the diversity of GAG function has also hindered their chemical characterization. Recent progress in coupling bacterial GAG-degrading enzymes with sensitive analytical techniques has led to a revolution in understanding the structure-function relationship for an important subset of GAGs, namely heparin/heparan sulfate-like glycosaminoglycans (HSGAGs). The study of chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate (CS/DS), an equally important subset of GAGs, has lagged behind partially due to a lack of enzymatic and analytical tools akin to those developed for HSGAGs. The Flavobacterial heparinases have proven indispensable in characterizing the fine structure of HSGAGs responsible for their different biological functions. As a continuation of ongoing research, a combination of chemical modification, peptide mapping, and site-directed mutagenesis was employed to explore the role of histidine in the activity of heparinase III. Of the thirteen histidines in the enzyme, His295 and His510 were found to be critical for the degradation of heparan sulfate by heparinase III. As a first step to developing the chondroitinases as enzymatic tools for the characterization of CS/DS oligosaccharides, recombinant expression and purification schemes were developed for chondroitinase AC and B from Flactobacterium heparinum. The recombinant enzymes were characterized using biochemical techniques and kinetic parameters were determined for their respective CS/DS substrates. (cont.) By combining the modeling a tetrasaccharide substrate into the active site of chondroitinase B with site-directed mutagenesis studies, a variety of residues were identified as critical for substrate binding and catalysis. A subsequent co-crystal structure of chondroitinase B with DS-derived hexasaccharide revealed a catalytic role for a calcium ion and provided further clarity into the role of individual active site amino acids. Additionally, using a variety of defined DS-derived oligosaccharides coupled with sensitive analytical techniques, chondroitinase B was identified as an endolytic, non-random, non-processive enzyme that preferentially cleaves longer oligosaccharides compared to shorter ones. Taken together, these studies represent a critical step in developing the chondroitinases as enzymatic tools for the characterization of CS/DS oligosaccharides in a fashion akin to the use of the heparinases to characterize HSGAGs.  Development of novel analytical tools for complex carbohydrates Complex carbohydrates such as the heparin/heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (HSGAGs) and the asparagine linked glycans (N-glycans) have emerged as crucial components of many human biological systems. Both classes of molecules have diverse roles in normal and pathological processes including development, cell growth, wound healing, angiogenesis, viral entry, and cancer. Taking advantage of the ability of carbohydrates to affect biological outcomes, several companies have already begun developing sugar-based structures as therapeutics for malaria and breast cancer, among others. However, the structural complexity that allows HSGAGs and N-glycans to exhibit such a wide array of activities also makes them more difficult to study than their protein and nucleotide counterparts. There are currently no effective methods for rapid synthesis of specific HSGAG or N-glycan structures, and until recently, most common analytical techniques were not useful in this field due to sensitivity constraints. Now, with advances in separation techniques and mass spectrometry, the fundamental roles of biological carbohydrates can be elucidated more efficiently. However, there is still a need for improved methodologies for studying these classes of molecules. This thesis describes the development of a novel technique for the direct isolation and sequencing of protein-binding HSGAG oligosaccharides. As a proof-of-concept, we used heparin and HSGAG-binding proteins of known specificity (fibroblast growth factor and antithrombin III), then utilized the technique to identify an oligosaccharide binder for a protein with unknown HSGAG binding specificity (endostatin). Furthermore, this technique can be readily applied to carbohydrate material from the cell surface. We have (cont.) optimized methods for harvesting and purifying cell surface HSGAGs that are suitable for use in many experimental procedures. Taken together, these methods will allow for the rapid identification of HSGAG sequences from biologically relevant sources that bind to proteins of interest, potentially leading to new pharmaceutical targets. Not only do carbohydrates represent a huge potential drug market, they have an enormous role in the development of protein therapeutics. Since N-glycans can significantly alter the activity and half-life of proteins, it is essential to have the appropriate glycosylation for maximum effect. We therefore optimized a method for analyzing the carbohydrate component of N-glycans from mass-produced proteins, and compared the glycosylation patterns of the same protein produced in different types of bioreactors. Further, we built upon the methods for analyzing N-glycans from single proteins to obtain a complete N-glycan profile from total serum glycoproteins. Searching for patterns in these profiles may yield new information on N-glycan changes in disease states, and lead to more sensitive diagnostic testing.  Glycomics : an emerging paradigm to protein-carbohydrate interactions Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are a family of complex carbohydrates whose known biological roles have dramatically increased over the recent years. It is now becoming increasingly evident that sequence specific GAG-protein interactions play critical roles in cell growth, development, angiogenesis, cancer, anticoagulation and microbial pathogenesis. Therefore it is important to understand the specificity of glycan-protein interactions and how these specific interactions influence their structure-function relationships. This thesis addresses many challenges in this emerging area of glycomics, by taking an integrated approach that couples biophysical and biochemical methods with a bioinformatics framework to represent and process sequence information content in GAGs. With this motivation the thesis is divided into 4 components 1. Using heparin/heparan sulfate GAGs (HSGAGs) - fibroblast growth factor (FGF) as a model GAG-protein system, the first part focuses on determining the structural basis of FGF oligomerization, sequence specific FGF-HSGAG interactions and FGF-receptor (FGFR) interactions which collectively influence the specificity of HSGAG mediated FGF signaling. 2. The second part focuses on developing enzymatic tools for analysis of GAGs using chondroitinase B, HSGAG 2-0 sulfatase and 3-0 sulfotransferase as model enzymes. For each of these enzymes a theoretical model for the enzyme-substrate structural complex is developed and it is coupled with the site directed mutagenesis and biochemical studies to determine its catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity. 3. To deal with the heterogeneity and high information density of GAG sequences, an informatics based approach to decode GAG sequence information has been developed. (cont.) A new property encoded nomenclature (PEN) computational framework has been formulated to encode and process information content in GAG sequences. The numerical nature of the PEN code facilitated the incorporation of diverse data sets from different analytical methods including mass spectrometry, electrophoresis and NMR as constraints to accurately determine the sequence of GAGs. Two practical methodologies for sequencing GAGs have been developed based on this approach. 4. The last part outlines the development of a powerful relational database that is capable of bridging sequence, structure and function information in glycomics. Thus this database and its associated computational tools to search and mine the data is an important resource for advancing glycomics.  Investigations into therapeutic discovery and delivery of heparin-like glycosaminoglycans Heparin-like glycosaminoglycans (HLGAGs) are complex polysaccharides found both in extracellular matrix (ECM) and at the cell surface where they, in a sequence-specific manner, bind to and regulate the biological activity of numerous proteins. Due to a lack of effective tools to study structure-function relationship of these complex molecules, the role(s) of HLGAGs in cancer remains largely indirect and poorly understood. To study the role(s) of HLGAGs in cancer growth, metastasis and angiogenesis, tumor systems were studied using heparinases I and III which have distinct substrate specificities. Studies, focusing on the biochemistry of the heparinase active site, elucidated key interactions important for enzymatic activities, thus enabling the biological studies presented here. In vitro cell culture study with heparinases as tools clearly showed that cell surface HLGAGs are involved in regulating fundamental cellular activities including cell proliferation, invasion and adhesion. Significantly, heparinase I and III demonstrated distinct effect on these cellular activities with heparinase III inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, invasion and adhesion in selected model systems and heparinase I inhibiting these processes. Further in vivo studies in animal tumor models confirmed and expanded the distinct responses to heparinase I and III treatment. HLGAG fragments generated from heparinase treatment were found to be responsible for the effect of heparinase treatment in tumor models. Moreover, cell surface HLGAGs containing cryptic activatory and inhibitory sequence information were identified and characterized. In contrast to heparinase I- generated HLGAG fragments, heparinase III- generated HLGAG fragments were shown here to inhibit both primary tumor growth and secondary lung metastasis. (cont.) The inhibition of tumor by heparinase III treatment was attributed to inhibition of specific signaling pathways such as FGF2 signaling. In an effort to develop a non-invasive and efficient delivery strategy for HLGAG-based therapeutics, HLGAGs were prepared as dry aerosol of defined characteristics for pulmonary inhalation. Pharmacokinetics study revealed efficient absorption for both formulated and unformulated dry aerosolized HLGAGs after pulmonary inhalation. Significantly, pulmonary inhalation of aerosolized HLGAGs was demonstrated to be effective in treating both local respiratory diseases including tumor metastasis and systemic thrombosis.  Novel tools for sequence and epitope analysis of glycosaminoglycans Our understanding of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) biology has been limited by a lack of sensitive and efficient analytical tools designed to deal with these complex molecules. GAGs are heterogeneous and often sulfated linear polys accharides found throughout the extracellular environment, and available to researchers only in limited mixtures. A series of sensitive label-free analytical tools were developed to provide sequence information and to quantify whole epitopes from GAG mixtures. Three complementary sets of tools were developed to provide GAG sequence information. Two novel exolytic sulfatases from Flavobacterium heparinum that degrade heparan/heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (HSGAGs) were cloned and characterized. These exolytic enzymes enabled the exo-sequencing of a HSGAG oligosaccharide. Phenylboronic acids (PBAs) were specifically reacted with unsulfated chondroitin sulfate (CS) disaccharides from within a larger mixture. The resulting cyclic esters were easily detected in mass spectrometry (MS) using the distinct isotopic abundance of boron. Electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MSn) was employed to determine the fragmentation patterns of HSGAG disaccharides. These patterns were used to quantify relative amounts of isomeric disaccharides in a mixture. Fragmentation information is valuable for building methods for oligosaccharide sequencing, and the general method can be applied to quantify any isomers using MSn. Three other tools were developed to quantify GAG epitopes. Two microfluidic devices were characterized as HSGAG sensors. Sensors were functionalized either with protamine to quantify total HSGAGs or with antithrombin-III (AT-III) to quantify a specific anticoagulant epitope. (cont.) A charge sensitive silicon field effect sensor accurately quantified clinically relevant anticoagulants including low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), even out of serum. A mass sensitive suspended microchannel resonator (SMR) measured the same clinically relevant HSGAGs. When these two sensors were compared, the SMR proved more robust and versatile. The SMR signal is more stable, it can be reused ad infinitum, and surface modifications can be automated and monitored. The field effect sensor provided an advantage in selectivity by preferentially detecting highly charged HSGAGs instead of any massive, non-specifically bound proteins. Lastly, anti-HSGAG single chain variable fragments (scFv) were evolved using yeast surface display towards generating antibodies for HSGAG epitope sensing and clinical GAG neutralization.  Sequencing complex polysaccharides Glycosaminoglycans are complex polysaccharides that exist at the cell/extracellular matrix interface. As such, these information-dense molecules are key regulators of extracellular signals. However, to date, there has been a lack of effective biochemical and analytical tools for the analysis of glycosaminoglycan structure and hence, there is very little understanding of exactly how glycosaminoglycan structure impinges on function. Development of such tools is especially important for a key subset of glycosaminoglycans, i.e., heparin/heparan sulfate-like glycosaminoglycans (HLGAGs). As a first step in the development of tools to study HLGAG structure, biochemical studies were completed on the heparinases, a family of three HLGAG-degrading enzymes from Flavobacterium heparinum. With heparinase I, it was found that calcium is a necessary cofactor for optimal activity and that two putative calcium coordinating motifs exist in heparinase I. With heparinase II, a single cysteine and three histidines were found to be critical for proper enzymatic function. Finally, with heparinase III, two histidines were found to be catalytically important. (cont.) In addition to the development of the heparinases, sensitive analytical methodologies were developed to determine HLGAG structure. A novel mass spectrometric procedure was developed and used to define heparinase's II mechanism of action on defined oligosaccharide substrates. In addition, capillary electrophoresis, in combination with heparinase digestion, was used for the compositional analysis of HLGAG oligosaccharides. Coupling of these analytical techniques with a property-encoded nomenclature to handle the information density of HLGAGs enabled the development of a sequencing procedure for HLGAGs. These procedures were then used to probe a number of key biological processes that are mediated by HLGAGs. The sequencing approach developed herein was used to determine the structure of HLGAG oligosaccharides involved in hemostasis and viral binding. In addition, these approaches were used to probe HLGAG binding by clinically and biologically important signaling molecules, viz., fibroblast growth factor and endostatin. Together, these studies represent a foundation with which it possible to develop further HLGAG structure/function relationships, opening new avenues of research and making possible HLGAG-based therapeutics.  Glycosaminoglycan-protein interactions : the fibroblast growth factor paradigm Specific interactions between heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (HSGAGs) and proteins are central to a wide range of biological processes such as anticoagulation, angiogenesis and growth factor activation. The specificity involved in the HSGAG-protein interactions stems from the structural heterogeneity of HSGAGs, which are highly acidic biopolymers associated on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix. It is believed that structural specificity in the HSGAG-protein interactions determines the biological functions mediated by HSGAG-binding proteins such as basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2). A number of models have been proposed to account for the mode of FGF-FGFR interactions and the role of HSGAGs in modulating FGF2 signaling. It was hypothesized that one role played by HSGAGs was to stabilize FGF2 oligomers in a \"side-by-side\" or cis fashion for presentation to fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR). In this thesis research, we systematically examined different proposed modes of FGF2 dimerization and showed that extensive oligomerization of a FGF2 mutant protein could be achieved by oxidatively crosslinking. Heparin, a highly sulfated form of HSGAGs, was demonstrated to increase the extent of oligomerization. Therefore, the results reported here were consistent with the hypothesis that HSGAGs promoted FGF2 oligomerization in a \"side-by-side\" mode. The functional significance of a FGF2 dimer was tested using a genetically engineered dimeric FGF2 (dFGF2). Biochemical and biophysical properties of dFGF2, such as protein folding, heparin affinity and receptor (cont.) binding, were assayed. dFGF2 was found to exhibit higher activities in stimulating cell proliferation and cell survival in vitro compared with the monomeric wildtype. An in vivo rat cornea pocket model further corroborated the in vitro findings. The functional role of HSGAGs derived from the cell surface was studied here. It was found that distinct HSGAG fragments released by heparinase treatment were capable of modulating FGF2-stimulated cell proliferation depending on the expression of FGFR isoforms. This founding is consistent with the proposal that structural specificity of distinct HSGAG fragments dictated the interaction of HSGAGs with FGF and FGFR. The role of heparinase-generated HSGAG fragments in inhibiting cell proliferation was investigated. B16 melanoma cells treated with heparinase III were found to exhibit biochemical and morphological hallmarks of apoptosis. Conditioned medium derived from heparinase-treated cells was shown to be effective in suppressing cell growth. Gene array experiments and caspase activity assays further suggested that apoptotic cell death was mediated through a caspase 8-, death receptor-dependent pathway. Thus, the present study lends further credence to the proposal that cell surface HSGAGs plays a critical role in orchestrating cell phenotype. This thesis work provides the framework for understanding the molecular mechanism of growth factor activation and the structure-function relationship of HSGAG-mediated cell signaling. Results from this study may potentially be useful for therapeutic protein engineering and carbohydrate-based drug discovery.

By combining the modeling a tetrasaccharide substrate into the active site of chondroitinase B with site-directed mutagenesis studies, a variety of residues were identified as critical for substrate binding and catalysis. A subsequent co-crystal structure of chondroitinase B with DS-derived hexasaccharide revealed a catalytic role for a calcium ion and provided further clarity into the role of individual active site amino acids. Additionally, using a variety of defined DS-derived oligosaccharides coupled with sensitive analytical techniques, chondroitinase B was identified as an endolytic, non-random, non-processive enzyme that preferentially cleaves longer oligosaccharides compared to shorter ones. Taken together, these studies represent a critical step in developing the chondroitinases as enzymatic tools for the characterization of CS/DS oligosaccharides in a fashion akin to the use of the heparinases to characterize HSGAGs.  Development of novel analytical tools for complex carbohydrates Complex carbohydrates such as the heparin/heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (HSGAGs) and the asparagine linked glycans (N-glycans) have emerged as crucial components of many human biological systems. Both classes of molecules have diverse roles in normal and pathological processes including development, cell growth, wound healing, angiogenesis, viral entry, and cancer. Taking advantage of the ability of carbohydrates to affect biological outcomes, several companies have already begun developing sugar-based structures as therapeutics for malaria and breast cancer, among others. However, the structural complexity that allows HSGAGs and N-glycans to exhibit such a wide array of activities also makes them more difficult to study than their protein and nucleotide counterparts. There are currently no effective methods for rapid synthesis of specific HSGAG or N-glycan structures, and until recently, most common analytical techniques were not useful in this field due to sensitivity constraints. Now, with advances in separation techniques and mass spectrometry, the fundamental roles of biological carbohydrates can be elucidated more efficiently. However, there is still a need for improved methodologies for studying these classes of molecules. This thesis describes the development of a novel technique for the direct isolation and sequencing of protein-binding HSGAG oligosaccharides. As a proof-of-concept, we used heparin and HSGAG-binding proteins of known specificity (fibroblast growth factor and antithrombin III), then utilized the technique to identify an oligosaccharide binder for a protein with unknown HSGAG binding specificity (endostatin). Furthermore, this technique can be readily applied to carbohydrate material from the cell surface. We have (cont.) optimized methods for harvesting and purifying cell surface HSGAGs that are suitable for use in many experimental procedures. Taken together, these methods will allow for the rapid identification of HSGAG sequences from biologically relevant sources that bind to proteins of interest, potentially leading to new pharmaceutical targets. Not only do carbohydrates represent a huge potential drug market, they have an enormous role in the development of protein therapeutics. Since N-glycans can significantly alter the activity and half-life of proteins, it is essential to have the appropriate glycosylation for maximum effect. We therefore optimized a method for analyzing the carbohydrate component of N-glycans from mass-produced proteins, and compared the glycosylation patterns of the same protein produced in different types of bioreactors. Further, we built upon the methods for analyzing N-glycans from single proteins to obtain a complete N-glycan profile from total serum glycoproteins. Searching for patterns in these profiles may yield new information on N-glycan changes in disease states, and lead to more sensitive diagnostic testing.  Glycomics : an emerging paradigm to protein-carbohydrate interactions Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are a family of complex carbohydrates whose known biological roles have dramatically increased over the recent years. It is now becoming increasingly evident that sequence specific GAG-protein interactions play critical roles in cell growth, development, angiogenesis, cancer, anticoagulation and microbial pathogenesis. Therefore it is important to understand the specificity of glycan-protein interactions and how these specific interactions influence their structure-function relationships. This thesis addresses many challenges in this emerging area of glycomics, by taking an integrated approach that couples biophysical and biochemical methods with a bioinformatics framework to represent and process sequence information content in GAGs. With this motivation the thesis is divided into 4 components 1. Using heparin/heparan sulfate GAGs (HSGAGs) - fibroblast growth factor (FGF) as a model GAG-protein system, the first part focuses on determining the structural basis of FGF oligomerization, sequence specific FGF-HSGAG interactions and FGF-receptor (FGFR) interactions which collectively influence the specificity of HSGAG mediated FGF signaling. 2. The second part focuses on developing enzymatic tools for analysis of GAGs using chondroitinase B, HSGAG 2-0 sulfatase and 3-0 sulfotransferase as model enzymes. For each of these enzymes a theoretical model for the enzyme-substrate structural complex is developed and it is coupled with the site directed mutagenesis and biochemical studies to determine its catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity. 3. To deal with the heterogeneity and high information density of GAG sequences, an informatics based approach to decode GAG sequence information has been developed. (cont.) A new property encoded nomenclature (PEN) computational framework has been formulated to encode and process information content in GAG sequences. The numerical nature of the PEN code facilitated the incorporation of diverse data sets from different analytical methods including mass spectrometry, electrophoresis and NMR as constraints to accurately determine the sequence of GAGs. Two practical methodologies for sequencing GAGs have been developed based on this approach. 4. The last part outlines the development of a powerful relational database that is capable of bridging sequence, structure and function information in glycomics. Thus this database and its associated computational tools to search and mine the data is an important resource for advancing glycomics.  Investigations into therapeutic discovery and delivery of heparin-like glycosaminoglycans Heparin-like glycosaminoglycans (HLGAGs) are complex polysaccharides found both in extracellular matrix (ECM) and at the cell surface where they, in a sequence-specific manner, bind to and regulate the biological activity of numerous proteins. Due to a lack of effective tools to study structure-function relationship of these complex molecules, the role(s) of HLGAGs in cancer remains largely indirect and poorly understood. To study the role(s) of HLGAGs in cancer growth, metastasis and angiogenesis, tumor systems were studied using heparinases I and III which have distinct substrate specificities. Studies, focusing on the biochemistry of the heparinase active site, elucidated key interactions important for enzymatic activities, thus enabling the biological studies presented here. In vitro cell culture study with heparinases as tools clearly showed that cell surface HLGAGs are involved in regulating fundamental cellular activities including cell proliferation, invasion and adhesion. Significantly, heparinase I and III demonstrated distinct effect on these cellular activities with heparinase III inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, invasion and adhesion in selected model systems and heparinase I inhibiting these processes. Further in vivo studies in animal tumor models confirmed and expanded the distinct responses to heparinase I and III treatment. HLGAG fragments generated from heparinase treatment were found to be responsible for the effect of heparinase treatment in tumor models. Moreover, cell surface HLGAGs containing cryptic activatory and inhibitory sequence information were identified and characterized. In contrast to heparinase I- generated HLGAG fragments, heparinase III- generated HLGAG fragments were shown here to inhibit both primary tumor growth and secondary lung metastasis. (cont.) The inhibition of tumor by heparinase III treatment was attributed to inhibition of specific signaling pathways such as FGF2 signaling. In an effort to develop a non-invasive and efficient delivery strategy for HLGAG-based therapeutics, HLGAGs were prepared as dry aerosol of defined characteristics for pulmonary inhalation. Pharmacokinetics study revealed efficient absorption for both formulated and unformulated dry aerosolized HLGAGs after pulmonary inhalation. Significantly, pulmonary inhalation of aerosolized HLGAGs was demonstrated to be effective in treating both local respiratory diseases including tumor metastasis and systemic thrombosis.  A novel nanodelivery system for combination tumor therapy Anti-angiogenic therapy offers many benefits over traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy including fewer toxic side effects and the reduced development of drug resistance. Anti-angiogenics alone have not proven effective in inducing tumor regression in the clinic due to both the cytostatic nature of anti-angiogenic therapy and the potential formation of new regions of hypoxia within the tumor after therapy. The new therapeutic paradigm is for combining both anti-angiogenics and traditional cytotoxic agents for a synergistic effect. The efficacy of cytotoxic agents may be reduced after anti-angiogenic therapy, however, due to limited access to tumor vasculature and hypoxia-induced drug resistance. We propose that loading cytotoxic agents within the tumor prior to blood vessel collapse will enable both greater drug accumulation within the tumor as well as a reduction in the formation of therapy-induced regions of hypoxia. We present here a novel nanodelivery vehicle termed a 'nanocell' for the spatio-temporal recruitment of both anti-angiogenics and cytotoxic agents within the solid tumor to achieve this goal. Nanocells consist of a polymeric nanocore encapsulating the cytostatic agent doxorubicin surrounded by a lipid vesicle containing the anti-angiogenic agent combretastatin A4. (cont.) Nanocell treatment resulted in an 88% reduction in tumor size in vivo, compared to a 66% reduction in tumor size after delivering combretastatin A4 lipid vesicles and doxorubicin nanocores simultaneously but separately. Nanocell treatment also resulted in a significant reduction in systemic toxicity, fewer metastases to the lung and liver, and a greater degree of tumor apoptosis.  Sequencing complex polysaccharides Glycosaminoglycans are complex polysaccharides that exist at the cell/extracellular matrix interface. As such, these information-dense molecules are key regulators of extracellular signals. However, to date, there has been a lack of effective biochemical and analytical tools for the analysis of glycosaminoglycan structure and hence, there is very little understanding of exactly how glycosaminoglycan structure impinges on function. Development of such tools is especially important for a key subset of glycosaminoglycans, i.e., heparin/heparan sulfate-like glycosaminoglycans (HLGAGs). As a first step in the development of tools to study HLGAG structure, biochemical studies were completed on the heparinases, a family of three HLGAG-degrading enzymes from Flavobacterium heparinum. With heparinase I, it was found that calcium is a necessary cofactor for optimal activity and that two putative calcium coordinating motifs exist in heparinase I. With heparinase II, a single cysteine and three histidines were found to be critical for proper enzymatic function. Finally, with heparinase III, two histidines were found to be catalytically important. (cont.) In addition to the development of the heparinases, sensitive analytical methodologies were developed to determine HLGAG structure. A novel mass spectrometric procedure was developed and used to define heparinase's II mechanism of action on defined oligosaccharide substrates. In addition, capillary electrophoresis, in combination with heparinase digestion, was used for the compositional analysis of HLGAG oligosaccharides. Coupling of these analytical techniques with a property-encoded nomenclature to handle the information density of HLGAGs enabled the development of a sequencing procedure for HLGAGs. These procedures were then used to probe a number of key biological processes that are mediated by HLGAGs. The sequencing approach developed herein was used to determine the structure of HLGAG oligosaccharides involved in hemostasis and viral binding. In addition, these approaches were used to probe HLGAG binding by clinically and biologically important signaling molecules, viz., fibroblast growth factor and endostatin. Together, these studies represent a foundation with which it possible to develop further HLGAG structure/function relationships, opening new avenues of research and making possible HLGAG-based therapeutics.  Glycosaminoglycan-protein interactions : the fibroblast growth factor paradigm Specific interactions between heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (HSGAGs) and proteins are central to a wide range of biological processes such as anticoagulation, angiogenesis and growth factor activation. The specificity involved in the HSGAG-protein interactions stems from the structural heterogeneity of HSGAGs, which are highly acidic biopolymers associated on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix. It is believed that structural specificity in the HSGAG-protein interactions determines the biological functions mediated by HSGAG-binding proteins such as basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2). A number of models have been proposed to account for the mode of FGF-FGFR interactions and the role of HSGAGs in modulating FGF2 signaling. It was hypothesized that one role played by HSGAGs was to stabilize FGF2 oligomers in a \"side-by-side\" or cis fashion for presentation to fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR). In this thesis research, we systematically examined different proposed modes of FGF2 dimerization and showed that extensive oligomerization of a FGF2 mutant protein could be achieved by oxidatively crosslinking. Heparin, a highly sulfated form of HSGAGs, was demonstrated to increase the extent of oligomerization. Therefore, the results reported here were consistent with the hypothesis that HSGAGs promoted FGF2 oligomerization in a \"side-by-side\" mode. The functional significance of a FGF2 dimer was tested using a genetically engineered dimeric FGF2 (dFGF2). Biochemical and biophysical properties of dFGF2, such as protein folding, heparin affinity and receptor (cont.) binding, were assayed. dFGF2 was found to exhibit higher activities in stimulating cell proliferation and cell survival in vitro compared with the monomeric wildtype. An in vivo rat cornea pocket model further corroborated the in vitro findings. The functional role of HSGAGs derived from the cell surface was studied here. It was found that distinct HSGAG fragments released by heparinase treatment were capable of modulating FGF2-stimulated cell proliferation depending on the expression of FGFR isoforms. This founding is consistent with the proposal that structural specificity of distinct HSGAG fragments dictated the interaction of HSGAGs with FGF and FGFR. The role of heparinase-generated HSGAG fragments in inhibiting cell proliferation was investigated. B16 melanoma cells treated with heparinase III were found to exhibit biochemical and morphological hallmarks of apoptosis. Conditioned medium derived from heparinase-treated cells was shown to be effective in suppressing cell growth. Gene array experiments and caspase activity assays further suggested that apoptotic cell death was mediated through a caspase 8-, death receptor-dependent pathway. Thus, the present study lends further credence to the proposal that cell surface HSGAGs plays a critical role in orchestrating cell phenotype. This thesis work provides the framework for understanding the molecular mechanism of growth factor activation and the structure-function relationship of HSGAG-mediated cell signaling. Results from this study may potentially be useful for therapeutic protein engineering and carbohydrate-based drug discovery.  Enzymatic and analytical tools for the characterization of chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate glycosaminoglycans Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are complex polysaccharides that reside in the extracellular matrix and on the surfaces of all cells. The same complexity that contributes to the diversity of GAG function has also hindered their chemical characterization. Recent progress in coupling bacterial GAG-degrading enzymes with sensitive analytical techniques has led to a revolution in understanding the structure-function relationship for an important subset of GAGs, namely heparin/heparan sulfate-like glycosaminoglycans (HSGAGs). The study of chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate (CS/DS), an equally important subset of GAGs, has lagged behind partially due to a lack of enzymatic and analytical tools akin to those developed for HSGAGs. The Flavobacterial heparinases have proven indispensable in characterizing the fine structure of HSGAGs responsible for their different biological functions. As a continuation of ongoing research, a combination of chemical modification, peptide mapping, and site-directed mutagenesis was employed to explore the role of histidine in the activity of heparinase III. Of the thirteen histidines in the enzyme, His295 and His510 were found to be critical for the degradation of heparan sulfate by heparinase III. As a first step to developing the chondroitinases as enzymatic tools for the characterization of CS/DS oligosaccharides, recombinant expression and purification schemes were developed for chondroitinase AC and B from Flactobacterium heparinum. The recombinant enzymes were characterized using biochemical techniques and kinetic parameters were determined for their respective CS/DS substrates. (cont.)

Glycomics : an emerging paradigm to protein-carbohydrate interactions Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are a family of complex carbohydrates whose known biological roles have dramatically increased over the recent years. It is now becoming increasingly evident that sequence specific GAG-protein interactions play critical roles in cell growth, development, angiogenesis, cancer, anticoagulation and microbial pathogenesis. Therefore it is important to understand the specificity of glycan-protein interactions and how these specific interactions influence their structure-function relationships. This thesis addresses many challenges in this emerging area of glycomics, by taking an integrated approach that couples biophysical and biochemical methods with a bioinformatics framework to represent and process sequence information content in GAGs. With this motivation the thesis is divided into 4 components 1. Using heparin/heparan sulfate GAGs (HSGAGs) - fibroblast growth factor (FGF) as a model GAG-protein system, the first part focuses on determining the structural basis of FGF oligomerization, sequence specific FGF-HSGAG interactions and FGF-receptor (FGFR) interactions which collectively influence the specificity of HSGAG mediated FGF signaling. 2. The second part focuses on developing enzymatic tools for analysis of GAGs using chondroitinase B, HSGAG 2-0 sulfatase and 3-0 sulfotransferase as model enzymes. For each of these enzymes a theoretical model for the enzyme-substrate structural complex is developed and it is coupled with the site directed mutagenesis and biochemical studies to determine its catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity. 3. To deal with the heterogeneity and high information density of GAG sequences, an informatics based approach to decode GAG sequence information has been developed. (cont.) A new property encoded nomenclature (PEN) computational framework has been formulated to encode and process information content in GAG sequences. The numerical nature of the PEN code facilitated the incorporation of diverse data sets from different analytical methods including mass spectrometry, electrophoresis and NMR as constraints to accurately determine the sequence of GAGs. Two practical methodologies for sequencing GAGs have been developed based on this approach. 4. The last part outlines the development of a powerful relational database that is capable of bridging sequence, structure and function information in glycomics. Thus this database and its associated computational tools to search and mine the data is an important resource for advancing glycomics.  Investigations into therapeutic discovery and delivery of heparin-like glycosaminoglycans Heparin-like glycosaminoglycans (HLGAGs) are complex polysaccharides found both in extracellular matrix (ECM) and at the cell surface where they, in a sequence-specific manner, bind to and regulate the biological activity of numerous proteins. Due to a lack of effective tools to study structure-function relationship of these complex molecules, the role(s) of HLGAGs in cancer remains largely indirect and poorly understood. To study the role(s) of HLGAGs in cancer growth, metastasis and angiogenesis, tumor systems were studied using heparinases I and III which have distinct substrate specificities. Studies, focusing on the biochemistry of the heparinase active site, elucidated key interactions important for enzymatic activities, thus enabling the biological studies presented here. In vitro cell culture study with heparinases as tools clearly showed that cell surface HLGAGs are involved in regulating fundamental cellular activities including cell proliferation, invasion and adhesion. Significantly, heparinase I and III demonstrated distinct effect on these cellular activities with heparinase III inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, invasion and adhesion in selected model systems and heparinase I inhibiting these processes. Further in vivo studies in animal tumor models confirmed and expanded the distinct responses to heparinase I and III treatment. HLGAG fragments generated from heparinase treatment were found to be responsible for the effect of heparinase treatment in tumor models. Moreover, cell surface HLGAGs containing cryptic activatory and inhibitory sequence information were identified and characterized. In contrast to heparinase I- generated HLGAG fragments, heparinase III- generated HLGAG fragments were shown here to inhibit both primary tumor growth and secondary lung metastasis. (cont.) The inhibition of tumor by heparinase III treatment was attributed to inhibition of specific signaling pathways such as FGF2 signaling. In an effort to develop a non-invasive and efficient delivery strategy for HLGAG-based therapeutics, HLGAGs were prepared as dry aerosol of defined characteristics for pulmonary inhalation. Pharmacokinetics study revealed efficient absorption for both formulated and unformulated dry aerosolized HLGAGs after pulmonary inhalation. Significantly, pulmonary inhalation of aerosolized HLGAGs was demonstrated to be effective in treating both local respiratory diseases including tumor metastasis and systemic thrombosis.  A novel nanodelivery system for combination tumor therapy Anti-angiogenic therapy offers many benefits over traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy including fewer toxic side effects and the reduced development of drug resistance. Anti-angiogenics alone have not proven effective in inducing tumor regression in the clinic due to both the cytostatic nature of anti-angiogenic therapy and the potential formation of new regions of hypoxia within the tumor after therapy. The new therapeutic paradigm is for combining both anti-angiogenics and traditional cytotoxic agents for a synergistic effect. The efficacy of cytotoxic agents may be reduced after anti-angiogenic therapy, however, due to limited access to tumor vasculature and hypoxia-induced drug resistance. We propose that loading cytotoxic agents within the tumor prior to blood vessel collapse will enable both greater drug accumulation within the tumor as well as a reduction in the formation of therapy-induced regions of hypoxia. We present here a novel nanodelivery vehicle termed a 'nanocell' for the spatio-temporal recruitment of both anti-angiogenics and cytotoxic agents within the solid tumor to achieve this goal. Nanocells consist of a polymeric nanocore encapsulating the cytostatic agent doxorubicin surrounded by a lipid vesicle containing the anti-angiogenic agent combretastatin A4. (cont.) Nanocell treatment resulted in an 88% reduction in tumor size in vivo, compared to a 66% reduction in tumor size after delivering combretastatin A4 lipid vesicles and doxorubicin nanocores simultaneously but separately. Nanocell treatment also resulted in a significant reduction in systemic toxicity, fewer metastases to the lung and liver, and a greater degree of tumor apoptosis.  ",

        "text": "Using optical tweezers, single molecule fluorescence and the ZIF268 protein-DNA system to probe mechanotransduction mechanisms Optical tweezers instruments use laser radiation pressure to trap microscopic dielectric beads. With the appropriate chemistry, such a bead can be attached to a single molecule as a handle, permitting the application of force on the single molecule. Measuring the force applied in real-time is dependent on detecting the bead's displacement from the trapping laser beam axis. Back-focal-plane detection provides a way of measuring the displacement, in two-dimensions, at nanometer or better resolution. The first part of this work will describe the design of a simple and inexpensive position sensing module customized for optical tweezers applications. Single molecule fluorescence is another powerful technique used to obtain microscopic details in biological systems. This technique can detect the arrival of a single molecule into a small volume of space or detect the conformational changes of a single molecule. Combining optical tweezers with single-molecule fluorescence so that one can apply forces on a single molecule while monitoring its effects via single molecule fluorescence provides an even more powerful experimental platform to perform such microscopic studies. Due to the enhanced photobleaching of fluorophores caused by the trapping laser, this combined technology has only been demonstrated under optimized conditions. (cont.) The second part of this work will describe a straightforward and noninvasive method of eliminating this problem. The study of mechanotransduction in biological systems is critical to understanding the coupling between mechanical forces and biochemical reactions. Due to the recent advances in single molecule technology, it is now possible to probe such mechanisms at the single molecule level. The third and final part of this work will describe a basic mechanotransduction experiment using the well-studied ZIF268 protein-DNA system. An experimental assay and method of analysis will be outlined.  Tools to study the kinesin mechanome using optical tweezers Molecular motors play an important role in driving some of the most complex and important tasks in biological systems, ranging from transcribing RNA from a DNA template (Polymerases) to muscle contraction (Myosin) and propelling bacteria (Flagellum). Key to the understanding of the fundamental principles and designs by which molecular motor function has been the kinesin family. Missing, however, is a clear understanding of the series of events that take place at the atomistic level when kinesin walks on a microtubule and generates force. Recent MD simulations have identified the force-generating mechanism in kinesin, the cover-neck bundle, and strongly suggest that the formation of the CNB by the N-terminal cover strand and the C-terminal neck linker of the motor head are responsible for force generation. In this thesis we present tools developed in the Lang Laboratory to further elucidate the stepping motion and force generation mechanism of kinesin using Drosophila kinesin as a model system. We demonstrate the function of a force clamp specifically designed for the laboratory and show traces of WT kinesin walking under constant load. We also purified and tested kinesin mutants running under a force load. We present two assays specifically designed to study the interaction between kinesin and the last 10-18 C-terminal residues of a-p tubulin, the E-hook. We were unable to observe kinesin - e-hook interactions, such as those suggested by the formation of tethers, when the e-hook was bound to the surface. In the case of e-hook in solution, our results indicate that 2G kinesin was still functional and its stall force approximately 3 pN just as for the case when no e-hook is present. We also propose ways that the work in this thesis can be expanded. The force clamp can be easily adapted to study novel kinesin mutants under constant load in 2D. In addition, the force clamp can be used to probe the kinesin - e-hook interactions by looking at kinesin walking over microtubules with cleaved e-hooks. The e-hook assays presented in this thesis can also be expanded to include higher concentrations of e-hook or be performed using labeled e-hook to assess single molecule interactions and concentrations.

Exploring the mechanome with optical tweezers and single molecule fluorescence The combination of optical tweezers and single molecule fluorescence into an instrument capable of making combined, coincident measurements adds an observable dimension that allows for the examination of the localized effects of applied forces on biological systems. This technological advance had remained elusive due to the accelerated photobleaching of fluorophores in the presence of the high photon flux of the optical trap. This problem was circumvented by alternately modulating the trapping and fluorescence excitation laser beams, a technique named IOFF. Results show that our solution extends the longevity of Cy3 fluorophores by a factor of 20 without compromising the stiffness of the optical trap. This versatile arrangement can be extended to other fluorophores and was applied to unzip a 15 base pair region of dsDNA and to induce reversible conformational changes in a dsDNA hairpin labeled with a FRET pair. Next, this work developed an immobilization strategy and two single molecule assays for the CIpX ATPase, an enzyme capable of unfolding substrates that have been targeted for proteolytic degradation. In the first assay, which employs single molecule fluorescence, CIpX was found to unfold and translocate pre-engaged GFP substrates with a time constant of 22 s at saturating ATP concentrations, a rate that is 8-fold faster than bulk measurements clouded by binding and unbinding events. The second assay measured the strength of the ClpX-substrate interaction with optical tweezers. Results show that CIpX holds on to its substrates with forces on the order of 55 pN regardless of the nature and concentration of the nucleotide in solution. (cont.) Finally, optical tweezers were used to characterize the rheological properties of methylcellulose and polarized cells, to quantify the mechanical properties of bacteriophage, and to measure the forces generated by a cellular actin spring.

These metals may have negative biological effects on cells by disrupting homeostatic cellular processes and altering normal signal transduction. One possible mechanism for many of these negative effects may involve overproduction of reactive oxygen species that damage proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. To compound this oxidative damage, there is evidence consistent with the inhibition of repair of damaged DNA by these metals. As a result, there is an increase in mutagenicity and toxicity in the organisms. This thesis reviews the current literature relevant to the biochemistry and biology of arsenic and cadmium.

        "text": "Regulation of specific connexins differentially alters gap junction permeability and endothelial cell function While many have explored how vascular processes alter gap junction communication and composition few have analyzed the role of specific gap junction connexin proteins in regulating cellular communication and wound healing. Using RNA interference or peptide inhibitors to downregulate specific connexins we examined the role of gap junctions in intercellular diffusion, calcium excitation, and in mediating the expression of vascular regulators transforming growth factor-[Beta][ (TGF-[beta]), prostacyclin, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). siRNA inhibition of connexin 43 in porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAEC) significantly decreased the diffusion distance of Lucifer yellow dye and cytoplasmic calcium levels after mechanical wounding. Wound healing experiments suggested that stimulatory signals travel through gap junctions containing connexin 43, while inhibitory signal travel through gap junctions containing connexin 37. Connexin 43 and connexin 37 inhibition, alone or in combination, reduced the levels of secreted latent TGF-[beta] in confluent PAEC monolayers after 24 hours of incubation. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) behaved in a similar manner. Inhibition of any one of the three connexins resulted in a marked increase in eNOS concentration. (cont.) Yet, TGF-P was sensitive to simultaneous inhibition of connexins 37, 40, and 43 and prostacyclin was controlled by connexin 37 and/or connexin 40 but not connexin 43. We have demonstrated how selective inhibition of gap junction connexin expression can reveal the potent gap junction mediation of cellular communication, wound healing, and vascular function. We demonstrate for the first time that connexin proteins play distinct roles in vasoregulation with differential effects on TGF- [beta], eNOS and prostacyclin. This technique in general and findings in specific may help explain density-dependent control of vascular signaling and repair.

        "text": "Cartilage mechanobiology and transcriptional effects of combined mechanical compression and IGF-1 stimulation on bovine cartilage explants Background: Investigators have focused on mechano-regulation of upstream signaling and responses at the level of gene transcription, protein translation and post-translational modifications. Intracellular pathways including those involving integrin signaling, mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and release of intracellular calcium have been confirmed in several laboratories. Studies with IGF-1: Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1) is a potent anabolic factor capable of endocrine and paracrine/autocrine signaling. Previous studies have demonstrated that mechanical compression can regulate the action of IGF-1 on chondrocyte biosynthesis in intact tissue; when applied simultaneously, these stimuli act by distinct cell activation pathways. Our objectives were to elucidate the extent and kinetics of the chondrocyte transcriptional response to combined IGF-1 and static compression in cartilage explants. Discussion: Clustering analysis revealed five distinct groups. TIMP-3 and ADAMTS-5, MMP-l and IGF-2, and IGF-1 and Collagen II, were all robustly co-expressed under all conditions tested. In comparing gene expression levels to previously measured aggrecan biosynthesis levels, aggrecan synthesis is shown to be transcriptionally regulated by IGF- 1, whereas inhibition of aggrecan synthesis by compression is not transcriptionally regulated. (cont.) Conclusion: Many genes measured are responsive the effects of IGF-1 under 0% compression and 50% compression. Clustering analysis revealed strong co-expressed gene pairings. IGF-1 stimulates aggrecan biosynthesis in a transcriptionally regulated manner, whereas compression inhibits aggrecan synthesis in a manner not regulated by transcriptional activity.  A quantitative proteomics study of the additive effect of inflammatory cytokines and injurious compression on cartilage damage Objectives: 1) To perform a quantitative comparison of proteins released to media on combination with cytokine (IL-1[beta[ or TNF-[alpha]) and Injury as compared to either treatment alone, and to thus identify proteins which may be responsible for the synergism seen between cytokine and injury in causing catabolism of cartilage in vitro. 2) To identify proteins which contribute most to some commonly observed phenotypes on treatment of cartilage with cytokine or injury or both. Methods : Cartilage explants from calves were treated with (i)IL-1 (10 ng/ml), (ii)TNF[alpha] (100 ng/ml), (iii)Injurious compression (50% strain at 100%/sec) and IL-1[beta] (10 ng/ml) or (iv)Injurious compression (50% strain at 100%/sec) and TNF-[alpha](10 ng/ml), cultured for 5 days post treatment, and the pooled media collected, labeled with one of four iTRAQ labels and subjected to nano-2D-LC/MS/MS on a quadrupole time of flight instrument. Peptides were identified and quantified using Protein PilotTM, and MATLAB scripts used to obtain protein ratios. These results were analyzed using different statistical techniques. Data from two iTRAQ experiments were combined to generate data for all possible injury and cytokine treatment conditions, and proteins on which injury and cytokines acted synergistically identified. PLSR analysis was performed using Unscrambler®X software with the combined data set to determine which proteins are most relevant to some observed phenotypes. The phenotypes chosen were sGAG released to media in 5 days post treatment, proline and sulfate incorporation rates on day 6 post treatment, and nitrite accumulation in media in 5 days post treatment Results and Discussion: TNF-[alpha]+injury and IL-[beta] +injury treatment conditions show a very high correlation with each other. Most cytosolic, ER lumen and nuclear protein levels are highly elevated with both cytokine+injury conditions, while ECM proteins are either highly down regulated or marginally elevated. Many collagen telopeptides are down regulated, possibly indicating reduced anabolism. However, attempts at repair exist, as shown by increased levels of TGF-[beta] and activin A, and reduced levels of LTBP1. Also, biglycan and lumican, SLRPs known to be involved in early development are significantly increased, possibly indicating repair attempts. Other SLRPs such as PRELP and chondroadherin are also highly elevated, with one or both injury+cytokine treatments. While MMPs are mildly down regulated or remain the same, ADAMTS1 increases with TNF-a+injury, indicating increased catabolism. Among ECM structural proteins, COMP shows high down regulation with TNF-[alpha]+injury, possibly due to reduced synthesis. Proenkephalin, a signaling molecule possibly involved in tissue/repair and apoptosis, AIMPI, a multifunctional proapoptotic, inflammatory and pro-repair cytokine and Annexin A5, a protein indicating mineralization and apoptosis are all highly elevated with cytokine+injury indicating heightened apoptosis and/or repair. When results of two 4-plex iTRAQ experiments are combined to obtain data for all possible combinations of injury and cytokine, we again find a very high correlation between TNF-a+injury and IL-1 +injury (-95%), slightly higher than the correlation between TNF-[alpha] alone and IL-[beta] alone (-90%), and much higher than the correlation of either cytokine+injury condition with cytokine alone (-70%) or injury alone (-75%). (cont.) This shows that IL-1[beta] and TNF-[alpha] in combination with injury act through very similar pathways in chondrocytes to produce their effect on cartilage tissue. TNF-a and injury were seen to act synergistically in a positive fashion on aggrecan, CILP-2, COL6A3 and histone H4, and in a negative fashion on SPARC and IGFBP7, suggesting that these proteins may be involved in causing synergism between injury and cytokine in releasing sGAG to the media. A PLSR analysis shows that SPARC and IGFBP7 project close to proline and sulfate incorporation, and far away from sGAG, indicating that SPARC and IGFBP7 may be proteins involved in anabolism. The highest phenotype-protein positive correlations obtained using PLSR are sGAG with Perlecan, SAA3, Complement factor B, CILP-2 and pleiotropin, indicating that all these 5 proteins are associated strongly with catabolism and can serve as markers of catabolism. The correlation of inflammatory proteins SAA3 and complement factor B with sGAG indicates the role of inflammation with catabolism. Conclusion: The combination of injury and cytokine affects tissue differently at a molecular level as compared to either chemical or mechanical stresses alone. Increased catabolism and increased attempts at tissue repair are observed due to a combination of injury and cytokine, and a combination of injury and cytokine may thus serve as a useful model to study OA in vitro.  Developing osteoarthritis treatments through cartilage tissue engineering and molecular imaging Tissue engineering can be applied to develop therapeutic techniques for osteoarthritis, a degenerative disease caused by the progressive deterioration of cartilage in joints. An inherent goal in developing cartilage-replacement treatments is ensuring that tissue-engineered constructs possess the same properties as native cartilage tissue. Biochemical assays and imaging techniques can be used to study some of the main components of cartilage and assess the value of potential therapies. Agarose and self-assembling peptides have been used to make hydrogels for in vitro culture of bovine bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) which can differentiate into chondrocytes, undergo chondrogenesis, and produce cartilage tissue. So far, differences in cell morphology that characterize chondrogenesis had been observed in peptide hydrogels like KLD and RAD but not in the 2.0% agarose hydrogels typically used for culture. A tissue engineering study was conducted to determine if a suitable environment for cell proliferation and differentiation could be obtained using different agarose compositions. BMSCs were cultured in 0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.0% agarose hydrogels for 21 days following TGF-p1 supplementation. Results indicate that the 0.5% agarose hydrogels are clearly inferior scaffolds when compared to the 1.0% and 2.0% agarose hydrogels, which are generally comparable. Since agarose gels appear to be suboptimal in promoting chondrogenesis, self-assembling peptides should be used in future studies. In addition to the biochemical assays traditionally used in cartilage tissue engineering studies, atomic force microscopy (AFM) can be used to image aggrecan, one of the main components of cartilage. Imaging studies were carried out using fetal bovine epiphyseal aggrecan to optimize previous extraction and sample preparation procedures, as well as an AFM imaging protocol, for samples containing aggrecan. Experiments were conducted with 10, 25, and 50 ptg/mL aggrecan solutions to find the minimum concentration needed to create aggrecan monolayers on APTES-mica that would yield acceptable AFM images (25 [mu]g/mL). AFM instrument and software parameters were optimized to find the working range of the integral and proportional gains (0.2 - 0.4 and 0.6 - 0.8, respectively) and to increase the resolution, showing fields at the 800 nm level. Finally, an image processing protocol relevant to these molecules was established. Use Of synthetic solid scaffolds to mechanically support a chondrocyte-seeded peptide hydrogel for articular cartilage repair Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) is a subtype of OA associated with cartilage defects caused by traumatic joint injury. Because articular cartilage has a limited innate healing response, due to its avascular, aneural, and alymphatic nature, these defects lead to chronic degenerative joint disease if left untreated. Current treatments to repair articular cartilage generally result in fibrocartilage that is mechanically and biochemically inferior to native hyaline tissue. This has motivated the development of tissue engineering strategies for cartilage defect repair. Hydrogel approaches have shown promising results in their ability to induce chondrogenesis, proliferation, and cartilage-like matrix production, but are often very soft at early time points and at risk of damage from joint articulation. Solid scaffolds solve this mechanical problem, but often sacrifice bioactivity and integration with native tissue. In order to avoid the drawbacks of each of these approaches, we proposed a composite scaffold approach using a synthetic solid scaffold, made of bioabsorbable polyglycolic acid:trimethylene carbonate (PGA:TMC) or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), loaded with a chondrocyte-seeded self-assembling peptide hydrogel, [KLDL]₃. We hypothesized that these composite scaffolds would benefit from the mechanical protection of the solid scaffolds as well as the pro-chondrogenic and proliferative effects of the KLD hydrogel, allowing chondrocytes to produce cartilage-like extracellular matrix in a protected mechanical environment. To test the potential of these composite scaffolds for use in cartilage repair, we measured cell distribution, viability, matrix production and accumulation, and static and dynamic mechanical properties. We found that cells could be evenly distributed through at least one of the solid scaffolds tested, with all showing proliferation and maintenance of viability over four-week culture. Per-cell matrix production was an order of magnitude higher than in KLD hydrogels alone. Mechanical properties of composite scaffolds appeared to be dominated by the solid scaffolds, showing that they offered mechanical protection to the soft hydrogel within. Use in a cartilage defect model showed potential for integration with native tissue given optimization of gel-casting methods. Overall, our results show that these composite scaffolds are a viable tissue engineering strategy for articular cartilage repair. Cartilage mechanobiology and transcriptional effects of combined mechanical compression and IGF-1 stimulation on bovine cartilage explants Background: Investigators have focused on mechano-regulation of upstream signaling and responses at the level of gene transcription, protein translation and post-translational modifications. Intracellular pathways including those involving integrin signaling, mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and release of intracellular calcium have been confirmed in several laboratories. Studies with IGF-1: Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1) is a potent anabolic factor capable of endocrine and paracrine/autocrine signaling. Previous studies have demonstrated that mechanical compression can regulate the action of IGF-1 on chondrocyte biosynthesis in intact tissue; when applied simultaneously, these stimuli act by distinct cell activation pathways. Our objectives were to elucidate the extent and kinetics of the chondrocyte transcriptional response to combined IGF-1 and static compression in cartilage explants. Discussion: Clustering analysis revealed five distinct groups. TIMP-3 and ADAMTS-5, MMP-l and IGF-2, and IGF-1 and Collagen II, were all robustly co-expressed under all conditions tested. In comparing gene expression levels to previously measured aggrecan biosynthesis levels, aggrecan synthesis is shown to be transcriptionally regulated by IGF- 1, whereas inhibition of aggrecan synthesis by compression is not transcriptionally regulated. (cont.) Conclusion: Many genes measured are responsive the effects of IGF-1 under 0% compression and 50% compression. Clustering analysis revealed strong co-expressed gene pairings. IGF-1 stimulates aggrecan biosynthesis in a transcriptionally regulated manner, whereas compression inhibits aggrecan synthesis in a manner not regulated by transcriptional activity.  A quantitative proteomics study of the additive effect of inflammatory cytokines and injurious compression on cartilage damage Objectives: 1) To perform a quantitative comparison of proteins released to media on combination with cytokine (IL-1[beta[ or TNF-[alpha]) and Injury as compared to either treatment alone, and to thus identify proteins which may be responsible for the synergism seen between cytokine and injury in causing catabolism of cartilage in vitro. 2) To identify proteins which contribute most to some commonly observed phenotypes on treatment of cartilage with cytokine or injury or both. Methods : Cartilage explants from calves were treated with (i)IL-1 (10 ng/ml), (ii)TNF[alpha] (100 ng/ml), (iii)Injurious compression (50% strain at 100%/sec) and IL-1[beta] (10 ng/ml) or (iv)Injurious compression (50% strain at 100%/sec) and TNF-[alpha](10 ng/ml), cultured for 5 days post treatment, and the pooled media collected, labeled with one of four iTRAQ labels and subjected to nano-2D-LC/MS/MS on a quadrupole time of flight instrument. Peptides were identified and quantified using Protein PilotTM, and MATLAB scripts used to obtain protein ratios. These results were analyzed using different statistical techniques. Data from two iTRAQ experiments were combined to generate data for all possible injury and cytokine treatment conditions, and proteins on which injury and cytokines acted synergistically identified. PLSR analysis was performed using Unscrambler®X software with the combined data set to determine which proteins are most relevant to some observed phenotypes. The phenotypes chosen were sGAG released to media in 5 days post treatment, proline and sulfate incorporation rates on day 6 post treatment, and nitrite accumulation in media in 5 days post treatment Results and Discussion: TNF-[alpha]+injury and IL-[beta] +injury treatment conditions show a very high correlation with each other. Most cytosolic, ER lumen and nuclear protein levels are highly elevated with both cytokine+injury conditions, while ECM proteins are either highly down regulated or marginally elevated. Many collagen telopeptides are down regulated, possibly indicating reduced anabolism. However, attempts at repair exist, as shown by increased levels of TGF-[beta] and activin A, and reduced levels of LTBP1. Also, biglycan and lumican, SLRPs known to be involved in early development are significantly increased, possibly indicating repair attempts. Other SLRPs such as PRELP and chondroadherin are also highly elevated, with one or both injury+cytokine treatments. While MMPs are mildly down regulated or remain the same, ADAMTS1 increases with TNF-a+injury, indicating increased catabolism. Among ECM structural proteins, COMP shows high down regulation with TNF-[alpha]+injury, possibly due to reduced synthesis. Proenkephalin, a signaling molecule possibly involved in tissue/repair and apoptosis, AIMPI, a multifunctional proapoptotic, inflammatory and pro-repair cytokine and Annexin A5, a protein indicating mineralization and apoptosis are all highly elevated with cytokine+injury indicating heightened apoptosis and/or repair. When results of two 4-plex iTRAQ experiments are combined to obtain data for all possible combinations of injury and cytokine, we again find a very high correlation between TNF-a+injury and IL-1 +injury (-95%), slightly higher than the correlation between TNF-[alpha] alone and IL-[beta] alone (-90%), and much higher than the correlation of either cytokine+injury condition with cytokine alone (-70%) or injury alone (-75%). (cont.) This shows that IL-1[beta] and TNF-[alpha] in combination with injury act through very similar pathways in chondrocytes to produce their effect on cartilage tissue. TNF-a and injury were seen to act synergistically in a positive fashion on aggrecan, CILP-2, COL6A3 and histone H4, and in a negative fashion on SPARC and IGFBP7, suggesting that these proteins may be involved in causing synergism between injury and cytokine in releasing sGAG to the media. A PLSR analysis shows that SPARC and IGFBP7 project close to proline and sulfate incorporation, and far away from sGAG, indicating that SPARC and IGFBP7 may be proteins involved in anabolism. The highest phenotype-protein positive correlations obtained using PLSR are sGAG with Perlecan, SAA3, Complement factor B, CILP-2 and pleiotropin, indicating that all these 5 proteins are associated strongly with catabolism and can serve as markers of catabolism. The correlation of inflammatory proteins SAA3 and complement factor B with sGAG indicates the role of inflammation with catabolism. Conclusion: The combination of injury and cytokine affects tissue differently at a molecular level as compared to either chemical or mechanical stresses alone. Increased catabolism and increased attempts at tissue repair are observed due to a combination of injury and cytokine, and a combination of injury and cytokine may thus serve as a useful model to study OA in vitro.  Developing osteoarthritis treatments through cartilage tissue engineering and molecular imaging Tissue engineering can be applied to develop therapeutic techniques for osteoarthritis, a degenerative disease caused by the progressive deterioration of cartilage in joints. An inherent goal in developing cartilage-replacement treatments is ensuring that tissue-engineered constructs possess the same properties as native cartilage tissue. Biochemical assays and imaging techniques can be used to study some of the main components of cartilage and assess the value of potential therapies. Agarose and self-assembling peptides have been used to make hydrogels for in vitro culture of bovine bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) which can differentiate into chondrocytes, undergo chondrogenesis, and produce cartilage tissue. So far, differences in cell morphology that characterize chondrogenesis had been observed in peptide hydrogels like KLD and RAD but not in the 2.0% agarose hydrogels typically used for culture. A tissue engineering study was conducted to determine if a suitable environment for cell proliferation and differentiation could be obtained using different agarose compositions. BMSCs were cultured in 0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.0% agarose hydrogels for 21 days following TGF-p1 supplementation. Results indicate that the 0.5% agarose hydrogels are clearly inferior scaffolds when compared to the 1.0% and 2.0% agarose hydrogels, which are generally comparable. Since agarose gels appear to be suboptimal in promoting chondrogenesis, self-assembling peptides should be used in future studies. In addition to the biochemical assays traditionally used in cartilage tissue engineering studies, atomic force microscopy (AFM) can be used to image aggrecan, one of the main components of cartilage. Imaging studies were carried out using fetal bovine epiphyseal aggrecan to optimize previous extraction and sample preparation procedures, as well as an AFM imaging protocol, for samples containing aggrecan. Experiments were conducted with 10, 25, and 50 ptg/mL aggrecan solutions to find the minimum concentration needed to create aggrecan monolayers on APTES-mica that would yield acceptable AFM images (25 [mu]g/mL). AFM instrument and software parameters were optimized to find the working range of the integral and proportional gains (0.2 - 0.4 and 0.6 - 0.8, respectively) and to increase the resolution, showing fields at the 800 nm level. Finally, an image processing protocol relevant to these molecules was established.

In vitro culture of a chondrocyte-seeded peptide hydrogel and the effects of dynamic compression Emerging medical technologies for effective and lasting repair of articular cartilage include delivery of cells or cell-seeded scaffolds to a defect site to initiate de novo tissue regeneration. Biocompatible scaffolds assist in providing a template for cell distribution and extracellular matrix accumulation in a three-dimensional geometry. In these studies, a self-assembling peptide hydrogel is evaluated as a potential scaffold for cartilage repair using a model bovine cell source. A seeding technique is developed for 3-D encapsulation of chondrocytes in a peptide hydrogel. The chondrocyte-seeded peptide hydrogel was then evaluated cellular activities in vitro under standard culture conditions and also when subjected to dynamic compression. During 4 weeks of culture in vitro, chondrocytes seeded within the peptide hydrogel retained their morphology and developed a cartilage-like ECM rich in proteoglycans and type II collagen, indicative of a stable chondrocyte phenotype. Time dependent accumulation of this ECM was paralleled by increases in material stiffness, indicative of deposition of mechanically-functional neo-tissue. Culture of chondrocyte-seeded peptide hydrogels in ITS-supplemented medium was investigated as an alternative to high serum culture. Low serum (0.2%), ITS-supplemented medium was found to maintain high levels of cell division and extracellular matrix synthesis and accumulation, as seen in high serum culture. Furthermore, low serum, ITS medium induced minimal chondrocyte de-differentiation on the surface of the hydrogel. This is in contrast to high serum culture, where surface de-differentiation and subsequent proliferation led to a 5-10 cell thick layer that stained positive for type I collagen. (cont.) The effects of dynamic compression of chondrocyte-seeded peptide hydrogels were evaluated over long-term culture. A non-continuous loading protocol was identified in which proteoglycan, but not protein, synthesis increased over static, free-swelling culture. Increases in GAG matrix accumulation were observed after at least 8 days of loading, while hydroxyproline accumulation was unaffected by dynamic compression. These data demonstrated dynamic compression differentially regulated the synthesis of proteoglycans. Analysis of GAG loss to the medium indicated peak proteoglycan catabolism occurred immediately after the initiation of loading. This phenomenon was further explored using a modified loading protocol that increased GAG loss to the medium. Peak GAG loss to the medium was 2-fold higher than previously observed, resulting in GAG accumulation values significantly less than controls. Hydroxyproline accumulation was minimally affected by loading, demonstrating that dynamic compression also differentially regulated the catabolism of proteoglycans. Proteoglycan catabolism was not predominantly due to physical disruption accumulated extracellular matrix or loss of newly-synthesized molecules. Instead, the presence of MMPs in the medium that coincided with GAG loss suggest a potential enzymatic mechanism. These results demonstrate the potential of a self-assembling peptide hydrogel as a scaffold for the synthesis and accumulation of a true cartilage-like extracellular matrix ...  Chondrocyte response to in vitro mechanical injury and co-culture with joint capsule tissue Acute traumatic joint injury in young adults leads to an increased risk for the development of osteoarthritis (OA) later in life irrespective of surgical intervention to stabilize the injured joint. Although the mechanism by which injury leads to joint degeneration remains to be elucidated, several injury-related factors may contribute to the development of OA. These factors include but are not limited to altered mechanical loading and initiation of a cellular response in cartilage or other joint tissues at the time of the injury. Three in vitro models of joint injury were investigated to separately evaluate the effects on cartilage of mechanical overloading and damage to joint capsule and synovial lining. Models of injury included (1) mechanical injury lto cartilage explants alone, (2) co-culture of normal cartilage explants with an excised specimen of joint capsule tissue, and (3) co-culture of mechanically injured cartilage explants with excised joint capsule tissue. These models have been shown previously to result in matrix damage and decreased biosynthesis by the chondrocytes. We measured gene expression levels of matrix molecules and matrix proteases and found them to be expressed in control cartilage at levels ranging over five orders of magnitude, and to be differentially regulated in these three models of joint injury. (cont.) Expression of matrix molecules including collagen II and aggrecan were unaffected by injurious compression or co-culture with joint capsule tissue during the first 24 hours; however, the combination of injurious compression followed by co-culture resulted in a -50% decrease in expression by 24 hours. Matrix proteases aggrecanase-2 (ADAMTS-5) and stromelysin (MMP-3) showed increased expression of 40-250-fold by 12 hours following injurious compression and 6-12-fold during 24 hours of co-culture with joint capsule tissue. Aggrecanase-1 (ADAMTS-4) and collagenase-3 (MMP-13) showed larger magnitude increases in expression during co-culture (6-8-fold; 6-24 hours) compared to injurious compression (2-4-fold; 6-24 hours). Expression of transcription factors, c-fos and c-jun, was rapidly increased by injurious compression (40-100-fold within one hour) but was less affected by co-culture with joint capsule tissue (increased 3-5-fold; 1-24 hours). Expression level results displayed a general trend toward matrix degradation in the models of joint injury with specific differences apparent between the models. Analysis of matrix protein fragments in the same injury models showed cleavage of aggrecan at the aggrecanase site in the interglobular domain by 16 days following injurious compression and during co-culture with joint capsule tissue. (cont.) Equilibrium and dynamic stiffness of cartilage explants were decreased by 30-35% immediately after injurious compression but were unaffected through 16 days of co-culture with joint capsule tissue. Specific changes in gene expression and activity of matrix proteases observed in these injury models may be indicative of some of the molecules responsible in the initial phase of cartilage degradation observed clinically following joint injury.  Chondrocyte gene expression and intracellular signaling pathways in cartilage mechanotransduction Chondrocytes respond to in vivo mechanical loads by regulating the composition of the cartilage extracellular matrix. This study utilized three loading protocols that span the range of forces and flows induced by in vivo loading. Constant (static) compression of cartilage explants induces a transient hydrostatic pressure buildup and fluid exudation from the compacted matrix until relaxation leads to a new equilibrium compressed state. Dynamic compression induces cyclic matrix deformation, hydrostatic pressures, fluid flows, and streaming currents. Dynamic tissue shear causes cyclic matrix deformation only. After applying these loading protocols to intact cartilage explants for 1 to 24 hours, we used real-time PCR to measure the temporal expression profiles of selected genes associated with cartilage homeostasis. In concurrent experiments, we assessed the involvement of intracellular signaling pathways using molecular inhibitors. In order to interpret the results we developed two techniques that reliably clustered intermediate-sized datasets using principal component analysis and k-means clustering. Mechanical loading regulated a variety of genes including matrix proteins, proteases, protease inhibitors, transcription factors, cytokines, and growth factors. Static compression transiently upregulated matrix proteins, however, mRNA levels were suppressed by 24 hours. (cont.) Dynamic compression and dynamic shear increased matrix protein transcription particularly after 24 hours. In contrast, matrix proteases were upregulated by all 24 hour loading regimes, particularly static compression. Taken together these results demonstrate the functionally-coordinated regulation of chondrocyte gene transcription in response to mechanical forces, and support the hypothesis that dynamic loading is anabolic for cartilage and static loading is anti-anabolic. Intracellular calcium release, cAMP activation of protein-kinase-A, and the phosphorylation of MAP kinases (ERK1/2, p38), were all identified as signaling events necessary for mechanically-induced transcription. In addition, we measured the immediate, transient increase in mRNA levels of transcription factors downstream of the MAP kinase pathway (c-Fos and c-Jun), in response to all three loading types. The prevention of protein synthesis during static compression suppressed mechanically-induced transcription suggesting that signaling molecules are synthesized in response to mechanical forces. Comparison of this well characterized model of normal cartilage mechanotransduction to what occurs within diseased cartilage will hopefully provide insight into the mechanisms driving the progression of osteoarthritis.  Progression of chondrocyte signaling responses to mechanical stimulation in 3-D gel culture Mechanical stimulation of 3-D chondrocyte cultures increases extracellular matrix (ECM) production and mechanical stiffness in regenerating cartilage. The goal of this study was to examine the progression of chondrocyte signaling responses to mechanical stimulation in 3-D culture during tissue regeneration. To investigate the role of integrins in chondrocyte mechanotransduction, function-blocking antibodies and small-molecule antagonists were used to disrupt integrin-matrix interactions during dynamic compression of chondrocytes in 3-D agarose culture. At early days in culture, blocking [alpha]v[beta]3 integrin abolished dynamic compression stimulation of proteoglycan synthesis, independent of effects in free-swell culture, while blocking [alpha]5[beta]1 integrins abolished the effect of compression only when blocking in free-swell increased proteoglycan synthesis. This suggests that disrupting [alpha]v[beta]3 and [alpha]5[beta]1 interactions with the ECM influences proteoglycan synthesis in distinct pathways and that [alpha]v[beta]3 more directly influences the mechanical response. To further distinguish individual mechanotransduction pathways, we investigated the temporal gene transcription response of chondrocytes to ramp-and-hold compression on Days 1, 10, and 28 in 3-D agarose culture. Clustered and individual gene expression profiles changed temporally and in magnitude over time in culture. Day 1 cultures differed from Days 10 and 28, reflecting changes in cell microenvironment with development of pericellular and extracellular matrices. Comparisons with the response of intact tissue to compression suggested similar regulatory mechanisms. We further investigated MAPkinase (ERK1/2, p38, JNK) and Akt activation on Days 1 and 28 in agarose culture through phosphorylation state-specific Western blotting. (cont.) Compression induced transient ERK1/2 phosphorylation on both days, with Day 28 levels similar to intact tissue. Unique from tissue behavior, only slight transient p38 phosphorylation was observed on Day 28, and SEK phosphorylation was undetected. Akt was uniquely regulated in intact cartilage compared to MAPks, with decreased total Akt levels over time under static compression. In contrast, compression transiently decreased pAkt levels in agarose cultures, with no changes in total Akt. Changes in the chondrocyte responses to compression with time in agarose culture suggest that cells sense different forces and respond differently with time; further studies may help optimize mechanical loading for tissue-engineering purposes. These studies provide a basis for further examination of mechanotransduction in cartilage.  Cartilage response to in vitro models of injury in combination with growth factor and antioxidant treatments Approximately one in five Americans is affected by arthritis, making it one of the most prevalent diseases and the leading cause of disability in the United States. Post-traumatic arthritis occurs after joint injury (e.g., ACL rupture or intraarticular fracture) and makes up a substantial proportion of the population with arthritis. In previous clinical studies, patients suffering from a traumatic joint injury have shown an increased risk in osteoarthritis (OA), independent of surgical intervention to stabilize the joint. Thus, the early events post-injury have an important effect on tissue within the joint in the long term. To understand the processes involved in the onset of OA and factors leading to OA post-traumatic injury, in vitro models have been developed to isolate components of the complex processes occurring in vivo. While in vitro models do not mimic true physiologic conditions in vivo, by isolating the effects of mechanical compression, cytokine treatment, and cartilage co-cultured with adjacent tissue, in vitro models can give insight into key biological and mechanical pathways occurring in vivo. This study focuses on changes in cartilage gene and protein expression and associated cartilage matrix degradation in response to static or injurious compression of the tissue in the presence or absence of cytokines including TNF-a and IL-6. In addition, normal or injuriously compressed cartilage explants were co-cultured with injured (excised) joint capsule tissue, another in vitro model of post-traumatic cellular behavior. Both young bovine cartilage and human cartilage from a wide range of ages were used. The growth factors insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and Osteogenic protein-i (OP-1), as well as the antioxidant, superoxide dismutase mimetic (SODm), were tested to examine if they had the capability to abrogate the negative effects of these injury models. (cont.) Taking a systems approach, the effects of these stimuli on expression of over 48 genes (in cartilage as well as joint capsule) were quantified, along with measures of chondrocyte viability, biosynthesis, protein expression, and GAG loss. Chondrocyte gene expression was differentially regulated by 50% static compression or IGF- 1 treatment or the combination of compression and IGF- 1. Results showed that IGF- 1 stimulated aggrecan biosynthesis in a transcriptionally regulated manner, whereas compression inhibited aggrecan synthesis in a manner not regulated by transcriptional activity. The injury plus co-culture model was examined in detail, and OP-1 and IGF-1 were unable to rescue changes in transcriptional expressions due to injury. However, these growth factors were able to rescue cells from apoptosis, and slightly increase biosynthesis rates. Human tissue was used to further validate the model of mechanical injury (INJ) combined with co-culture (Co). Immunohistochemical analysis of human cartilage explants after INJ+Co treatment revealed changes in versican and aggrecan protein expression, as well as changes in surface tissue morphology, that mimicked certain changes observed in human osteochondral plugs taken from patients at the time of notchplasty surgery (post ACL reconstruction) at 1, 3, or 57 months post- ACL rupture. The oxidative stress involved in a cytokine plus injury model showed that SODm had no ability to selectively diminish protease transcriptional activity. Cartilage treated with this antioxidant showed significant increases in GAG loss to the medium, but diminished levels of chondrocyte apoptosis. Taken together, this work supports further investigation of the mechanisms of action of OP-1, IGF-1, and SODm in order to elucidate their possible therapeutic value, and demonstrates the usefulness of these complementary in vitro models of cartilage injury.  In vitro culture of a chondrocyte-seeded peptide hydrogel and the effects of dynamic compression Emerging medical technologies for effective and lasting repair of articular cartilage include delivery of cells or cell-seeded scaffolds to a defect site to initiate de novo tissue regeneration.

The effects of dynamic compression of chondrocyte-seeded peptide hydrogels were evaluated over long-term culture. A non-continuous loading protocol was identified in which proteoglycan, but not protein, synthesis increased over static, free-swelling culture. Increases in GAG matrix accumulation were observed after at least 8 days of loading, while hydroxyproline accumulation was unaffected by dynamic compression. These data demonstrated dynamic compression differentially regulated the synthesis of proteoglycans.

Aggrecanase-1 (ADAMTS-4) and collagenase-3 (MMP-13) showed larger magnitude increases in expression during co-culture (6-8-fold; 6-24 hours) compared to injurious compression (2-4-fold; 6-24 hours). Expression of transcription factors, c-fos and c-jun, was rapidly increased by injurious compression (40-100-fold within one hour) but was less affected by co-culture with joint capsule tissue (increased 3-5-fold; 1-24 hours). Expression level results displayed a general trend toward matrix degradation in the models of joint injury with specific differences apparent between the models. Analysis of matrix protein fragments in the same injury models showed cleavage of aggrecan at the aggrecanase site in the interglobular domain by 16 days following injurious compression and during co-culture with joint capsule tissue.

Progression of chondrocyte signaling responses to mechanical stimulation in 3-D gel culture Mechanical stimulation of 3-D chondrocyte cultures increases extracellular matrix (ECM) production and mechanical stiffness in regenerating cartilage. The goal of this study was to examine the progression of chondrocyte signaling responses to mechanical stimulation in 3-D culture during tissue regeneration. To investigate the role of integrins in chondrocyte mechanotransduction, function-blocking antibodies and small-molecule antagonists were used to disrupt integrin-matrix interactions during dynamic compression of chondrocytes in 3-D agarose culture. At early days in culture, blocking [alpha]v[beta]3 integrin abolished dynamic compression stimulation of proteoglycan synthesis, independent of effects in free-swell culture, while blocking [alpha]5[beta]1 integrins abolished the effect of compression only when blocking in free-swell increased proteoglycan synthesis. This suggests that disrupting [alpha]v[beta]3 and [alpha]5[beta]1 interactions with the ECM influences proteoglycan synthesis in distinct pathways and that [alpha]v[beta]3 more directly influences the mechanical response. To further distinguish individual mechanotransduction pathways, we investigated the temporal gene transcription response of chondrocytes to ramp-and-hold compression on Days 1, 10, and 28 in 3-D agarose culture. Clustered and individual gene expression profiles changed temporally and in magnitude over time in culture. Day 1 cultures differed from Days 10 and 28, reflecting changes in cell microenvironment with development of pericellular and extracellular matrices. Comparisons with the response of intact tissue to compression suggested similar regulatory mechanisms. We further investigated MAPkinase (ERK1/2, p38, JNK) and Akt activation on Days 1 and 28 in agarose culture through phosphorylation state-specific Western blotting. (cont.) Compression induced transient ERK1/2 phosphorylation on both days, with Day 28 levels similar to intact tissue. Unique from tissue behavior, only slight transient p38 phosphorylation was observed on Day 28, and SEK phosphorylation was undetected. Akt was uniquely regulated in intact cartilage compared to MAPks, with decreased total Akt levels over time under static compression. In contrast, compression transiently decreased pAkt levels in agarose cultures, with no changes in total Akt. Changes in the chondrocyte responses to compression with time in agarose culture suggest that cells sense different forces and respond differently with time; further studies may help optimize mechanical loading for tissue-engineering purposes. These studies provide a basis for further examination of mechanotransduction in cartilage.  Cartilage response to in vitro models of injury in combination with growth factor and antioxidant treatments Approximately one in five Americans is affected by arthritis, making it one of the most prevalent diseases and the leading cause of disability in the United States. Post-traumatic arthritis occurs after joint injury (e.g., ACL rupture or intraarticular fracture) and makes up a substantial proportion of the population with arthritis. In previous clinical studies, patients suffering from a traumatic joint injury have shown an increased risk in osteoarthritis (OA), independent of surgical intervention to stabilize the joint. Thus, the early events post-injury have an important effect on tissue within the joint in the long term. To understand the processes involved in the onset of OA and factors leading to OA post-traumatic injury, in vitro models have been developed to isolate components of the complex processes occurring in vivo. While in vitro models do not mimic true physiologic conditions in vivo, by isolating the effects of mechanical compression, cytokine treatment, and cartilage co-cultured with adjacent tissue, in vitro models can give insight into key biological and mechanical pathways occurring in vivo. This study focuses on changes in cartilage gene and protein expression and associated cartilage matrix degradation in response to static or injurious compression of the tissue in the presence or absence of cytokines including TNF-a and IL-6. In addition, normal or injuriously compressed cartilage explants were co-cultured with injured (excised) joint capsule tissue, another in vitro model of post-traumatic cellular behavior. Both young bovine cartilage and human cartilage from a wide range of ages were used. The growth factors insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and Osteogenic protein-i (OP-1), as well as the antioxidant, superoxide dismutase mimetic (SODm), were tested to examine if they had the capability to abrogate the negative effects of these injury models. (cont.) Taking a systems approach, the effects of these stimuli on expression of over 48 genes (in cartilage as well as joint capsule) were quantified, along with measures of chondrocyte viability, biosynthesis, protein expression, and GAG loss. Chondrocyte gene expression was differentially regulated by 50% static compression or IGF- 1 treatment or the combination of compression and IGF- 1. Results showed that IGF- 1 stimulated aggrecan biosynthesis in a transcriptionally regulated manner, whereas compression inhibited aggrecan synthesis in a manner not regulated by transcriptional activity. The injury plus co-culture model was examined in detail, and OP-1 and IGF-1 were unable to rescue changes in transcriptional expressions due to injury. However, these growth factors were able to rescue cells from apoptosis, and slightly increase biosynthesis rates. Human tissue was used to further validate the model of mechanical injury (INJ) combined with co-culture (Co). Immunohistochemical analysis of human cartilage explants after INJ+Co treatment revealed changes in versican and aggrecan protein expression, as well as changes in surface tissue morphology, that mimicked certain changes observed in human osteochondral plugs taken from patients at the time of notchplasty surgery (post ACL reconstruction) at 1, 3, or 57 months post- ACL rupture. The oxidative stress involved in a cytokine plus injury model showed that SODm had no ability to selectively diminish protease transcriptional activity. Cartilage treated with this antioxidant showed significant increases in GAG loss to the medium, but diminished levels of chondrocyte apoptosis. Taken together, this work supports further investigation of the mechanisms of action of OP-1, IGF-1, and SODm in order to elucidate their possible therapeutic value, and demonstrates the usefulness of these complementary in vitro models of cartilage injury.  In vitro culture of a chondrocyte-seeded peptide hydrogel and the effects of dynamic compression Emerging medical technologies for effective and lasting repair of articular cartilage include delivery of cells or cell-seeded scaffolds to a defect site to initiate de novo tissue regeneration. Biocompatible scaffolds assist in providing a template for cell distribution and extracellular matrix accumulation in a three-dimensional geometry. In these studies, a self-assembling peptide hydrogel is evaluated as a potential scaffold for cartilage repair using a model bovine cell source. A seeding technique is developed for 3-D encapsulation of chondrocytes in a peptide hydrogel. The chondrocyte-seeded peptide hydrogel was then evaluated cellular activities in vitro under standard culture conditions and also when subjected to dynamic compression. During 4 weeks of culture in vitro, chondrocytes seeded within the peptide hydrogel retained their morphology and developed a cartilage-like ECM rich in proteoglycans and type II collagen, indicative of a stable chondrocyte phenotype. Time dependent accumulation of this ECM was paralleled by increases in material stiffness, indicative of deposition of mechanically-functional neo-tissue. Culture of chondrocyte-seeded peptide hydrogels in ITS-supplemented medium was investigated as an alternative to high serum culture. Low serum (0.2%), ITS-supplemented medium was found to maintain high levels of cell division and extracellular matrix synthesis and accumulation, as seen in high serum culture. Furthermore, low serum, ITS medium induced minimal chondrocyte de-differentiation on the surface of the hydrogel. This is in contrast to high serum culture, where surface de-differentiation and subsequent proliferation led to a 5-10 cell thick layer that stained positive for type I collagen. (cont.) The effects of dynamic compression of chondrocyte-seeded peptide hydrogels were evaluated over long-term culture. A non-continuous loading protocol was identified in which proteoglycan, but not protein, synthesis increased over static, free-swelling culture. Increases in GAG matrix accumulation were observed after at least 8 days of loading, while hydroxyproline accumulation was unaffected by dynamic compression. These data demonstrated dynamic compression differentially regulated the synthesis of proteoglycans. Analysis of GAG loss to the medium indicated peak proteoglycan catabolism occurred immediately after the initiation of loading. This phenomenon was further explored using a modified loading protocol that increased GAG loss to the medium. Peak GAG loss to the medium was 2-fold higher than previously observed, resulting in GAG accumulation values significantly less than controls. Hydroxyproline accumulation was minimally affected by loading, demonstrating that dynamic compression also differentially regulated the catabolism of proteoglycans. Proteoglycan catabolism was not predominantly due to physical disruption accumulated extracellular matrix or loss of newly-synthesized molecules. Instead, the presence of MMPs in the medium that coincided with GAG loss suggest a potential enzymatic mechanism. These results demonstrate the potential of a self-assembling peptide hydrogel as a scaffold for the synthesis and accumulation of a true cartilage-like extracellular matrix ...  Chondrocyte response to in vitro mechanical injury and co-culture with joint capsule tissue Acute traumatic joint injury in young adults leads to an increased risk for the development of osteoarthritis (OA) later in life irrespective of surgical intervention to stabilize the injured joint. Although the mechanism by which injury leads to joint degeneration remains to be elucidated, several injury-related factors may contribute to the development of OA. These factors include but are not limited to altered mechanical loading and initiation of a cellular response in cartilage or other joint tissues at the time of the injury. Three in vitro models of joint injury were investigated to separately evaluate the effects on cartilage of mechanical overloading and damage to joint capsule and synovial lining. Models of injury included (1) mechanical injury lto cartilage explants alone, (2) co-culture of normal cartilage explants with an excised specimen of joint capsule tissue, and (3) co-culture of mechanically injured cartilage explants with excised joint capsule tissue. These models have been shown previously to result in matrix damage and decreased biosynthesis by the chondrocytes. We measured gene expression levels of matrix molecules and matrix proteases and found them to be expressed in control cartilage at levels ranging over five orders of magnitude, and to be differentially regulated in these three models of joint injury. (cont.) Expression of matrix molecules including collagen II and aggrecan were unaffected by injurious compression or co-culture with joint capsule tissue during the first 24 hours; however, the combination of injurious compression followed by co-culture resulted in a -50% decrease in expression by 24 hours. Matrix proteases aggrecanase-2 (ADAMTS-5) and stromelysin (MMP-3) showed increased expression of 40-250-fold by 12 hours following injurious compression and 6-12-fold during 24 hours of co-culture with joint capsule tissue. Aggrecanase-1 (ADAMTS-4) and collagenase-3 (MMP-13) showed larger magnitude increases in expression during co-culture (6-8-fold; 6-24 hours) compared to injurious compression (2-4-fold; 6-24 hours). Expression of transcription factors, c-fos and c-jun, was rapidly increased by injurious compression (40-100-fold within one hour) but was less affected by co-culture with joint capsule tissue (increased 3-5-fold; 1-24 hours). Expression level results displayed a general trend toward matrix degradation in the models of joint injury with specific differences apparent between the models. Analysis of matrix protein fragments in the same injury models showed cleavage of aggrecan at the aggrecanase site in the interglobular domain by 16 days following injurious compression and during co-culture with joint capsule tissue. (cont.) Equilibrium and dynamic stiffness of cartilage explants were decreased by 30-35% immediately after injurious compression but were unaffected through 16 days of co-culture with joint capsule tissue. Specific changes in gene expression and activity of matrix proteases observed in these injury models may be indicative of some of the molecules responsible in the initial phase of cartilage degradation observed clinically following joint injury.  Cartilage mechanobiology and transcriptional effects of combined mechanical compression and IGF-1 stimulation on bovine cartilage explants Background: Investigators have focused on mechano-regulation of upstream signaling and responses at the level of gene transcription, protein translation and post-translational modifications. Intracellular pathways including those involving integrin signaling, mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and release of intracellular calcium have been confirmed in several laboratories. Studies with IGF-1: Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1) is a potent anabolic factor capable of endocrine and paracrine/autocrine signaling. Previous studies have demonstrated that mechanical compression can regulate the action of IGF-1 on chondrocyte biosynthesis in intact tissue; when applied simultaneously, these stimuli act by distinct cell activation pathways. Our objectives were to elucidate the extent and kinetics of the chondrocyte transcriptional response to combined IGF-1 and static compression in cartilage explants. Discussion: Clustering analysis revealed five distinct groups. TIMP-3 and ADAMTS-5, MMP-l and IGF-2, and IGF-1 and Collagen II, were all robustly co-expressed under all conditions tested. In comparing gene expression levels to previously measured aggrecan biosynthesis levels, aggrecan synthesis is shown to be transcriptionally regulated by IGF- 1, whereas inhibition of aggrecan synthesis by compression is not transcriptionally regulated. (cont.) Conclusion: Many genes measured are responsive the effects of IGF-1 under 0% compression and 50% compression. Clustering analysis revealed strong co-expressed gene pairings. IGF-1 stimulates aggrecan biosynthesis in a transcriptionally regulated manner, whereas compression inhibits aggrecan synthesis in a manner not regulated by transcriptional activity.

        "text": "A novel bioengineering platform using functionalized self-assembly peptides to enhance CYP3A2 activity in modified rat hepatocyte sandwich cultures Isolated hepatocytes removed from their microenvironment soon lose their hepatospecific functions when cultured. Highly oxygen-demanding hepatocytes are commonly maintained under oxygen-deficient culture conditions, limited by culture medium thickness as well scaffold thickness. Thus, the cells are forced into anaerobic metabolic states that degenerate liver specific functions. Furthermore, cells separated from their extracellular matrix and disconnected from the synergistic interactions between other hepatic cells types further exacerbate hepatocellular function. This study aims to improve hepatospecific activity, especially CYP3A2 - a biomarker that is notoriously known to quickly lose expression in primary cultures, by creating a platform based on collagen sandwich cultures. The modified sandwich cultures are substituted with self-assembling peptide, RAD16-I, combined with integrin-binding sequence RGD or laminin receptor binding sequence YIGSR functional peptide motifs to create a cell-instructive peptide scaffold. To facilitate oxygen and nutrient diffusion and exchange, plasma modification technology is employed to control peptide layer dimension. We have successfully shown that plasma engineering can be used to optimize peptide thickness. (cont.) Likewise, we have shown that the incorporation of the functional motifs enhanced hepatospecific activity. CYP3A2 expression from cultures on our platform improved over 256 times the levels found in collagen sandwich cultures, the current standard for hepatocyte cultures. This study demonstrates the capability of sandwich cultures with modified instructive self-assembling peptides and the importance of thinner cultures scaffolds to promote better oxygen and nutrient exchange. We believe that our novel bioengineered platform has the potential to greatly improve existing hepatocyte culture methods and be invaluable to future in vitro hepatocyte studies as well as toxicity tests.

Previous research has identified methods to distinguish alternative conserved exons (ACEs) in human and mouse. However, the cellular machinery, the spliceosome, does not use comparative genomics to decide when to include and when to exclude an exon. Human RefSeq exons obtained from the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser were analyzed for tissue-specific skipping. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were aligned to exons and their tissue of origin and histology were identified. ACEs were also identified as a subset of the skipped exons. About 18% of the exons were identified as tissue-specifically skipped in one of sixteen different tissues at four stringency levels. The different datasets were analyzed for both general features such as exon and intron length, splice site strength, base composition, conservation, modularity, and susceptibility to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay caused by skipping. Cis-element motifs that might bind protein factors that affect splicing were identified using overrepresentation analysis and conserved occurrence rate between human and mouse. (cont.) Tissue-specific skipped exons were then classified with both a decision-tree based classifier (Random ForestsTM) and a support vector machine. Classification results were better for tissue-specific skipped exons vs. constitutive exons than for tissue-specific skipped exons vs. exons skipped in other tissues.

This goal was accomplished by comparing the growth and monoclonal antibody production by HPCHO Chinese hamster ovary cells and IB4 hybridoma cells in batch, fed-batch, and three perfusion systems: the stirred ceramic membrane reactor (SCMR), the alternating tangential flow (ATF) hollow fiber membrane system, and the external spin filter (ESF) system. The batch experiments for each cell line were used as base case scenarios for the comparisons of cell growth and monoclonal antibody production. The fed-batch experiments for each cell line did not vastly improve the cell growth and monoclonal antibody production over the batch cases. The SCMR perfusion system greatly improved the cell growth and monoclonal antibody production for each cell line. The maximum viable cell concentration of the IB4 hybridoma cells in the SCMR experiment was over seven times that found in the batch experiment and the monoclonal antibody production in the SCMR experiment was over ten times that found in the batch experiment. (cont.) The ATF perfusion system greatly increased the cell growth for each cell line over the batch cases, but the shear forces created by the system adversely affected the viability of the cells and the monoclonal antibody production was less than that of the SCMR experiments. The ESF perfusion system damaged the HPCHO Chinese hamster ovary cells. For the production of the IB4 hybridoma cells, the ESF system, as well as a modified ESF system, did not vastly improve the cell growth and monoclonal antibody over the base case due to cell aggregation and filter fouling. The cell growth and productivity data, along with economic considerations, were evaluated for the purpose of recommending the best feeding strategy for each of the two cell lines studied. It was concluded that the most successful operation mode for the two cell lines studied was the SCMR perfusion system. More research is needed regarding the scale-up ramifications of the SCMR perfusion system as well as in the quantification of monoclonal antibodies, the optimization of fed-batch systems, and the use of alternative perfusion systems.

In order to observe the synergistic interactions of the eight different muscles in the tongue, MRI techniques were used to determine the three-dimensional fiber architecture, measure the mechanical function of the tongue during swallow, and relate the two quantitatively to identify fiber contraction. Diffusion Tensor Imaging was applied to the in vivo tongue of five subjects at rest to image the tongue myoarchitecture. The data revealed the complex relationships between extrinsic and intrinsic fibers. Phase Contrast MRI was applied to ten subjects to assess the complex array of mechanical events occurring during the propulsive phase of swallowing. Physiological strain rate data was acquired in 4 and 6 time point series during approximately 3 ml water bolus swallows. Data acquisition was gated to pressure from the tip of the tongue against the hard palate, indicating the beginning of the irreversible late accommodation. This method demonstrated that the propulsive phase of swallowing is associated with a precisely organized series of compressive and expansive strain rate events. Individual subject data sets from both of these methods were then related. The alignment between local fiber direction and the co-located strain rate tensor was quantified by the dot product between the two vectors. Using this technique, the sagittal muscle activity was observed over the course of the swallow. In the first 200 ms after gating, the verticalis and palatoglossus contract in order to form the bolus. (cont.) From 300-400 ms, the genioglossus contracts, opening the bolus into the throat, while the verticalis and geniohyoid relax. at 500 ms, relaxation throughout the tongue occurs.

In the case of influenza, activated T cells migrate from the mediastinal (draining) lymph nodes to the lung where they perform their cytolytic function. After pathogen clearance, memory CD8+ T cells are generated, giving rise to long-term protection from reinfection. However, these cells are no longer detectable in the lung parenchyma six months post-infection, and cell-mediated immunity, and protection is lost. Knock-out studies in mice show that interleukin 15 (IL-15) is essential for memory CD8+ T cell proliferation. Fibroblasts, macrophages, dendritic cells and epithelial cells express IL-15 and its receptor isoform [alpha] (IL-15R[alpha]). Histological studies suggest that memory CD8+ T cells preferentially reside in peribronchiolar and perivascular areas, the stroma, of the lung. We hypothesize that memory CD8+ T cells preferentially reside in regions where molecules necessary for their maintenance, for example, IL-15/R secreting cells, are located. In this study, we have shown that antigen-specific 2C GFP effector memory CD8+ T cells are generated in B6 recipient mice 30-32 days after influenza virus infection, preferentially reside in peribronchiolar areas. Both 2C and 2C GFP recipient mice have severe vasculitis and widely distributed inflammatory infiltrates 7 days post-infection. Lower lung lobes appear to be more affected than upper lobes at this time point. On day 30, most of the airways have been cleared and restored. Although lymphoid-appearing nodules were detected in the lungs 31 dpi, no clusters of B cells and T cells suggesting induced BALT were identified by immunofluorescence. (cont.) Interestingly, antigen-specific GFP cells preferentially remained in the lung tissue and were almost undetectable in spleens, lymph nodes, and livers. This preference was not observed in 2C (non-GFP) recipient mice. Immunofluorescence studies showed no colocalization between 2C GFP T cells and dendritic cells that might suggest stable dendritic cell interactions contribute to antigen-specific cells preferentially residing in the lung stroma.

        "text": "Force-mediated adhesion strengthening in endothelial cells at adherens junctions Cells respond to the application of force with a variety of biochemical responses modulating their shape, structure, function, and proliferation. Two force-responsive links between the inside and outside of a cell are integrin proteins, which link a cell to the extracellular matrix (ECM), and cadherin proteins, which link neighboring cells to each other. The strength of integrin-ECM bonds has been noted to increase in response to the application of force. However, the strengthening of cadherin-cadherin bonds in response to force has not been studied. Here, we use magnetic trapping to probe adhesion strengthening at cadherin adherens junctions, using cadherin-coated magnetic beads to simulate neighboring cells and apply force at adherens junctions. 43% of beads exposed to a high force (2.1 nN) detached, compared to 31% of those exposed to a low-to-high force ramp followed by high force. This indicates that adherens junctions are strengthened by force application. The actin cytoskeleton and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) both associate with adherens junctions, so their role in adhesion strengthening at adherens junctions was also studied. Cells treated with actin-inhibitor cytochalasin D showed no difference in bead detachment from constant high force and from ramped followed by high force, indicating that the actin cytoskeleton is crucial in the adhesion strengthening response. Beads attached to cells expressing GFP-VASP, which behave like VASP-overexpressing cells, detached in 24% of trials when exposed to constant high force, compared to 39% of trials in response to ramped force. Cells expressing GFP-MITO-FPPPP, which behave like VASP-downregulated cells, showed no difference in bead detachment between application of high force and ramped force followed by high force. (cont.) These experiments indicate that VASP is necessary for the adhesion strengthening response, but high levels of VASP may slow actin restructuring and diminish the ability of the cytoskeletal linkages to respond to increasing force. The importance of VASP in cells' responses to forces from other cells suggest that modulation of VASP activity may play a role in tissue development, where cell-cell force responses are important, and the pathogenesis of certain diseases, where cell-cell adhesion is affected.

        "text": "Development and analysis of an in vitro model of inflammatory cytokine-mediated idiosyncratic drug hepatotoxicity Idiosyncratic drug reactions are a subset of adverse reactions frequently targeting the liver, which become obvious only in large sample populations. Drug-induced hepatotoxicity, occurring in a very small fraction of patients, poses a major challenge to pharmaceutical companies due to its unknown mechanism(s) of action and deficient models for study. In vitro model systems may have the potential to predict this liver injury by generating conditions possibly representing key processes involved, both directly and indirectly, in drug effects on cellular physiology. Our ultimate goal is to develop an in vitro model effectively mimicking certain relevant aspects of the in vivo response of the human liver. In our initial effort described herein, we have designed a novel cell-based system using alternatively in both a human hepatoma cell line and primary rat hepatocytes to study toxic effects in a background reflecting in vivo inflammatory conditions. This background incorporates bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration along with inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor, interferon y, interleukin-1 a, interleukin-113, and interleukin-6) previously shown to increase in LPS-administrated rats. Our study began with an investigation of toxicities that are induced by combinations of five cytokines and LPS in HepG2 and C3A human hepatoma cell lines and in primary rat hepatocytes. Informed by the results of these experiments, we selected representative cytokine/LPS treatments and cell systems to examine drug-cytokine synergies in vitro and were able to identify multiple idiosyncratic hepatotoxins that induced synergistic toxicity in either the HepG2 cell line or primary rat hepatocytes. (cont.) Finally, we measured the sensitization of these cell systems to a panel of these drugs, given an inflammatory background induced by an abbreviated set of cytokine treatments including four cytokines and LPS. Analysis of this multivariate drug-cytokine toxicity data set yielded a subset of representative cytokine treatments for future drug-cytokine synergy investigations. This subset will be used to characterize the differences between cell systems, including cultured human hepatocytes, and to hopefully develop a data-driven partial least squares regression model that predicts idiosyncratic liver injury. The implications are two-fold. First, this model could provide direction to pharmaceutical companies in focusing their drug discovery and development.

Quantitative analysis of the cytokine-mediated apoptosis-survival cell decision process How do cells sense their environment and decide whether to live or to die? This question has drawn considerable interest since 1972, when it was first discovered that cells have an intrinsic ability to self-destruct through a process called apoptosis. Since then, apoptosis has been shown to play a critical role in both normal physiology and disease. In addition, many of the basic molecular mechanisms that control apoptosis have been revealed. Yet despite the known list of interactions and regulators, it remains difficult to inspect the network of apoptosis-related proteins and predict how cells will behave. The challenge is even greater when one considers interactions with other networks that are anti-apoptotic, such as growth-factor networks. In this thesis, we develop an approach to measure, analyze, and predict how complex intracellular signaling networks transduce extracellular stimuli into cellular fates. This approach entails three interrelated aims: 1) to develop high-throughput, quantitative techniques that measure key nodes in the intracellular network; 2) to characterize the quantitative changes in network state and cell behavior by exposing cells to diverse fate-changing stimuli; and 3) to use data-driven modeling approaches that analyze large signaling-response datasets to suggest new biological hypotheses. (cont.) These aims were focused on an apoptosis-survival cell-fate decision process controlled by one prodeath cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and two prosurvival stimuli, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin. We first developed radioactive- and fluorescence-based high-throughput assays for quantifying activity changes in the kinases that catalyze key phosphorylation events downstream of TNF, EGF, and insulin. By combining these assays with techniques measuring other important posttranslational modifications, we then compiled over 7000 individual protein measurements of the cytokine-induced network. The signaling measurements were combined with over 1400 measurements of apoptotic responses by using partial least squares (PLS) regression approaches. These signaling-apoptosis regression models predicted apoptotic responses from cytokine-induced signaling patterns alone. Furthermore, the models helped to reveal the importance of previously unrecognized autocrine cytokines in controlling cell fate. This thesis has therefore shown how cell decisions, like apoptosis-versus-survival, can be understood and predicted from the quantitative information contained in the upstream signaling network.  Bayesian network models of biological signaling pathways Cells communicate with other cells, and process cues from their environment, via signaling pathways, in which extracellular cues trigger a cascade of information flow, causing signaling molecules to become chemically, physically or locationally modified, gain new functional capabilities, and affect subsequent molecules in the cascade, culminating in a phenotypic cellular response. Mapping the influence connections among biomolecules in a signaling cascade aids in understanding of the underlying biological process and in development of therapeutics for diseases involving aberrant pathways, such as cancer and autoimmune disease. In this thesis, we present an approach for automatically reverse-engineering the structure of a signaling pathway, from high-throughput data. We apply Bayesian network structure inference to signaling protein measurements performed in thousands of single cells, using a machine called a flow cytorneter. Our de novo reconstruction of a T-cell signaling map was highly accurate, closely reproducing the known pathway structure, and accurately predicted novel pathway connections. The flow cytometry measurements include specific perturbations of signaling molecules, aiding in a causal interpretation of the Bayesian network graph structure. (cont.) However, this machine can measure only -4-12 molecules per cell, too few for effective coverage of a signaling pathway. To address this problem, we employ a number of biologically motivated assumptions to extend our technique to scale up from the number of molecules measured to larger models, using measurements of overlapping variable subsets. We demonstrate this approach by scaling up to a model of 11 variables, using 15 overlapping 4-variable measurements.  A study of motor control in healthy subjects and in Parkinson's disease patients Parkinson's disease (PD) is a primarily motor disorder which affects at least half a million people in the US alone. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical intervention by which neural structures are stimulated electrically by an implanted pacemaker. It has become the treatment of choice for PD, when not adequately controlled by drug therapy. We introduced a novel robotic platform for the study of the effects of DBS on motor control in PD. Subjects performed discrete wrist movements with and without a force field. We found preliminary indication that motor learning may be taking place with stimulation, and demonstrated how robotic testing can augment existing clinical tools in evaluation of the disease. To study the effect of stimulation on movement frequency, we employed a rhythmic task that required movements of the elbow to remain within a closed shape on a phase plane. Three closed shapes required varying frequency/amplitude combinations of elbow movement. The task was performed with and without visual feedback. Analysis of data from the healthy control subjects revealed a non-monotonic relation between accuracy on the phase plane and movement speed. Further kinematic analyses, including movement intermittency and harmonicity, number and type of submovements (movement primitives) fit per movement cycle, and the effects of vision on intermittency were used to support the model we propose, whereby there exist two subtypes of rhythmic movement; small-amplitude, high-frequency movements are nearly maximally harmonic, and harness the elastic properties of the limb to achieve smoothness and accuracy, and large-amplitude, low-frequency movements share characteristics with a string of discrete movements, and make use of visual feedback to achieve smoothness and accuracy. (cont.) Bradykinesia (slowness of movement) is one of the hallmarks of PD. We examined the effects of visual feedback on bradykinesia. PD patients off dopaminergic medication and healthy age-matched controls performed significantly faster movements when visual feedback was withdrawn. For the bradykinetic subjects, this increase in movement speed meant either a mitigation or an elimination of bradykinesia. Our results support a role of the basal ganglia in sensorimotor integration, and argue for the integration of nonvision exercises into patients' physical therapy regime.

By combining these assays with techniques measuring other important posttranslational modifications, we then compiled over 7000 individual protein measurements of the cytokine-induced network. The signaling measurements were combined with over 1400 measurements of apoptotic responses by using partial least squares (PLS) regression approaches. These signaling-apoptosis regression models predicted apoptotic responses from cytokine-induced signaling patterns alone. Furthermore, the models helped to reveal the importance of previously unrecognized autocrine cytokines in controlling cell fate. This thesis has therefore shown how cell decisions, like apoptosis-versus-survival, can be understood and predicted from the quantitative information contained in the upstream signaling network.  Bayesian network models of biological signaling pathways Cells communicate with other cells, and process cues from their environment, via signaling pathways, in which extracellular cues trigger a cascade of information flow, causing signaling molecules to become chemically, physically or locationally modified, gain new functional capabilities, and affect subsequent molecules in the cascade, culminating in a phenotypic cellular response. Mapping the influence connections among biomolecules in a signaling cascade aids in understanding of the underlying biological process and in development of therapeutics for diseases involving aberrant pathways, such as cancer and autoimmune disease. In this thesis, we present an approach for automatically reverse-engineering the structure of a signaling pathway, from high-throughput data. We apply Bayesian network structure inference to signaling protein measurements performed in thousands of single cells, using a machine called a flow cytorneter. Our de novo reconstruction of a T-cell signaling map was highly accurate, closely reproducing the known pathway structure, and accurately predicted novel pathway connections. The flow cytometry measurements include specific perturbations of signaling molecules, aiding in a causal interpretation of the Bayesian network graph structure. (cont.) However, this machine can measure only -4-12 molecules per cell, too few for effective coverage of a signaling pathway. To address this problem, we employ a number of biologically motivated assumptions to extend our technique to scale up from the number of molecules measured to larger models, using measurements of overlapping variable subsets. We demonstrate this approach by scaling up to a model of 11 variables, using 15 overlapping 4-variable measurements.  ",

By recognition of specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), TLR-4 can in tandem initiate a pair of downstream signaling pathways to regulate cytokine/chemokine release, endotoxin tolerance and apoptosis, which have been suggested to directly or indirectly participate in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses. However, little is known about their detailed signal-response relationships. In this thesis, we sought to identify these potential signal-response relationships in RAW264.7 cells through systematic analysis. We first measured LPS stimulated dynamic signaling profiles over a range of an inhibitor of p38 MAPK, SB202190 concentrations for a distribution of kinases centrally involved in TLR-4 signaling network. We then applied quantitative analytical approaches to determine the most important signals or signal combinations contributing to induction of either IL-6 and TNF-ao secretion or apoptosis and construct their corresponding predictive mathematical models. Particularly, we found that the partial least squares regression (PLSR) models built using the ratio of phosphorylated Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) predicted LPS plus SB202190-induced apoptosis accurately even following perturbation with pharmacological inhibitors of JNK and ERK.

Although numerous animal models are available to study the molecular pathways, genetics and therapeutic/prevention strategies for T2D, no model completely recapitulates T2D or it's comorbidities in humans. Therefore, novel animal models represent valuable research tools in understanding T2D. To develop a novel mouse model of T2D, I characterized an outbred mouse discovered at MIT that displayed clinical signs of diabetes. Prevalence of glucosuria in the Swiss Webster colony reached 60% (n=70) in males 8 weeks to 6 months of age. Despite severe obesity in some females, no females were diabetic. Pathologic findings in affected males included cachexia, dilated gastrointestinal tracts with poor muscular tone, pancreatic islet degeneration and atrophy with compensatory metaplasia and/or neogenesis, bacterial pyelonephritis, membranous glomerulopathy, and late-onset hepatic tumors with macrosteatosis, microsteatosis and hydropic change in aged males. Serum insulin correlated with blood glucose in a nonlinear pattern suggestive of islet exhaustion. Circulating leptin levels showed a weak inverse correlation with glucose. Diabetic males were bred with obese colony females to produce 20 male and 20 female offspring. Prevalence of diabetes in male offspring was 80% (16/20) with a median age of onset of 18 weeks. In contrast, no diabetic females were identified, despite being significantly more obese than males. Male predominance is likewise a feature of T2D in humans. (cont.) To our knowledge, this is the first documentation of hepatocellular carcinoma and islet metaplasia and/or neogenesis in a spontaneous outbred mouse model of T2D. The SW availability and histolopathologic features represent a promising new model for the study of T2D.

Molecular pathogenesis of Helicobacter hepaticus induced liver disease Helicobacter hepaticus infection of A/JCr mice is a model of liver cancer resulting from chronic active inflammation. We monitored hepatic global gene expression profiles and correlated them to histological liver lesions in H. hepaticus infected and control male A/JCr mice at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year of age. We used an Affymetrix-based oligonucleotide microarray platform on the premise that a specific genetic expression signature at isolated time points would be indicative of disease status. Model based expression index comparisons generated by dChip yielded consistent profiles of differential gene expression for H. hepaticus infected male mice with progressive liver disease versus uninfected control mice within each age group. Linear discriminant analysis and principal component analysis allowed segregation of mice based on combined age and lesion status, or age alone. Up-regulated genes present throughout the 12 month study involved inflammation, tissue repair, and host immune function. Upregulation of putative tumor and proliferation markers correlated with advancing hepatocellular dysplasia. Transcriptionally down-regulated genes in mice with liver lesions included those related to peroxisome proliferator, cholesterol, and steroid metabolism pathways. Transcriptional profiling of hepatic genes documented gene expression signatures in the livers of H. hepaticus infected male A/JCr mice with chronic progressive hepatitis and preneoplastic liver lesions, complemented the histopathological diagnosis, and suggested molecular targets for the monitoring and intervention of disease progression prior to the onset of hepatocellular neoplasia. Our laboratory, in collaboration with Professors Suerbaum and Schauer, recently identified a (cont.) 70kb genomic island in Helicobacter hepaticus strain ATCC 51488 as a putative pathogenicity island (HhPAI) (Suerbaum et al, PNAS, 2003). This region within H. hepaticus contains genes HH0233-HH0302, a differential GC content, several long tandem repeats but no flanking repeats, and three components of a type IV secretion system (T4SS). A/JCr mice were experimentally infected with three naturally occurring strains of H. hepaticus including the type strain H. hepaticus ATCC 51488 strain (Hh 3B1) isolated from A/JCr mice, MIT 96-1809 (Hh NET) isolated from mice shipped from the Netherlands, and MIT-96-284 (HhG) isolated from mice acquired from Germany.4 HhNET (missing most of the HhPAI) infected male A/JCR mice exhibited a significantly lower prevalence (p<.05) of hepatic lesions at 6 months post infection than Hh 3B1 with an intact HhPAI. Hh G also has a large segment of the genomic island deleted, but not as many genes are deleted as compared to Hh NET. Hh G also demonstrated a lower prevalence of hepatic lesions. This variable pathological effect was evident in male mice only. The severity of chronic active inflammation in the liver of the H. hepaticus infected A/JCr mice depended on H. hepaticus liver colonization levels. The in vivo results support the presence of the HhPAI as a legitimate virulence determinant and predictor of severity of liver lesions in H. hepaticus infected A/JCr male mice. To further determine the differences in virulence of the H. hepaticus strains Hh 3B1, Hh NET, Hh G and an isogenic mutant H. ...  A systematic evaluation of the role of infection, immunity and inflammation in cholesterol gallstone pathogenesis Cholesterol gallstones are exceptionally common and cost nearly 10 billion U.S. dollars annually. Despite a half-century of basic and clinical research questions still remain about cholesterol gallstone pathogenesis. The purpose of the study presented herein is to analyze the roles of infection, and immunity in cholelithogenesis. The first two aims of this work were to analyze the role of enterohepatic Helicobacter spp. and the human gastric pathogen H. pylori in cholesterol gallstone formation. To test this, we prospectively infected C57UJ mice with a variety of Helicobacter spp. and fed infected and uninfected mice a lithogenic diet for eight weeks and analyzed biliary phenotype. Mice infected with H. bilis or coinfected with H. hepaticus and H. rodentium and fed a lithogenic diet developed cholesterol gallstones at 80% prevalence compared with approximately 10% in uninfected controls (P<0.05). Monoinfections with H. hepaticus, H. cinaedi, H. rodentium, and H. pylori gave a cholesterol gallstone prevalence of 40% (P<0.05), 30%, 20% and 20%, respectively; with the exception of H. hepaticus, cholesterol gallstone formation in these groups did not differ significantly from uninfected animals. (cont.) These findings suggest that some Helicobacter spp. play a role in the cholesterol gallstone formation in mice and perhaps humans. We further hypothesized that inflammation and immunity were important in cholesterol gallstone formation and that cholelithogenic bacteria were promoting gallstones through immune stimulation. To test this we utilized BALB/c and isogenic Rag2-/- mice. When fed a lithogenic diet for eight-weeks, wild-type mice developed cholesterol gallstones (27-80% prevalence) significantly more than Rag2-/- mice (~5%, P<0.05). Transfer of functional splenocytes, or T-lymphocytes to Rag2-/- mice markedly increased cholesterol gallstone formation (26% and 40% respectively, P<0.05) whereas transfer of B-cells did not (13%). The presence of T-cells and solid cholesterol monohydrate crystals induced proinflammatory cytokine expression in the gallbladder. These studies indicate that T-cells are critical in murine cholelithogenesis and function by promoting gallbladder inflammation. In summary, these results illustrate that microbial pathogens can influence cholesterol gallstone formation; this most likely occurs by modulating the immune response with T-cells being a critical component in this immunomodulation.  Pathogenesis of the carcinogenic bacterium, Helicobacter pylori Gastric cancer is the second most common malignancy in the digestive system and the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Epidemiological data and experimental studies have identified several risk factors for gastric cancer, including Helicobacter pylori infection, low fruit and vegetable intake, N-nitrosoamine exposure, high salt diet, and smoking. Among these risk factors, H. pylori infection is the major cause of gastric cancer. Therefore, H. pylori has been classified as a type 1 (definite) carcinogen for gastric cancer by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1994. H. pylori colonizes the human stomach and has been definitively linked to chronic gastritis. Infection in some: susceptible individuals results in serious gastric disease such as peptic ulcer or gastric cancer. The first aim of this thesis was to examine the role of different T cell subpopulations in H. pylori gastritis. Using a murine adoptive transfer model, adoptive transfer of wildtype (wt) effector T cells (TE) into H. pylori-infected lymphopenic Rag2-/- recipient mice resulted in H. pylori-associated corpus gastritis superimposed with non-specific gastroduodenitis. Cotransfer with TE and regulatory T cells (TR) from wt or IL10-/- mice reduced gastroduodenitis, but only wt TR cells reduced corpus gastritis. (cont.) The second aim of this thesis was to evaluate the effect of vitamin C on H. pylori gastritis in vitamin C-deficient gulo-/- mice. It was found that a high vitamin C supplementation (3300 mg/L) in drinking water did not protect H. pylori gastritis, while a low vitamin C supplementation (33 mg/L) reduced the severity of H. pylori gastritis via an attenuated cellular immune response to H. pylori. The third aim of this thesis was to examine the role of DNA repair in H. pylori-associated gastric disease. We found that H. pylori-associated premalignant gastric atrophy was more severe in infected mice lacking DNA repair protein 3-alkyladenine DNA glycosylase or 06-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase in comparison to infected wt control mice. The forth aim of this thesis was to examine whether antimicrobial H. pylori eradication therapy could prevent gastric cancer development in INS-GAS mice, a model of gastric cancer. We found that antimicrobial H. pylori eradication therapy prevented the progression to gastric cancer in H. pylori-infected INS-GAS mice when treatment was instituted at an early stage of H. pylori infection. (cont.) In conclusion, these studies provide further insight into the role of host immune responses in H. pylori pathogenesis. Additionally, information was garnered regarding the roles of vitamin C supplementation, DNA repair proteins, and H. pylori eradication therapy in H. pylori-associated gastric disease using genetically manipulated mice.

Monoinfections with H. hepaticus, H. cinaedi, H. rodentium, and H. pylori gave a cholesterol gallstone prevalence of 40% (P<0.05), 30%, 20% and 20%, respectively; with the exception of H. hepaticus, cholesterol gallstone formation in these groups did not differ significantly from uninfected animals. (cont.) These findings suggest that some Helicobacter spp. play a role in the cholesterol gallstone formation in mice and perhaps humans. We further hypothesized that inflammation and immunity were important in cholesterol gallstone formation and that cholelithogenic bacteria were promoting gallstones through immune stimulation. To test this we utilized BALB/c and isogenic Rag2-/- mice. When fed a lithogenic diet for eight-weeks, wild-type mice developed cholesterol gallstones (27-80% prevalence) significantly more than Rag2-/- mice (~5%, P<0.05). Transfer of functional splenocytes, or T-lymphocytes to Rag2-/- mice markedly increased cholesterol gallstone formation (26% and 40% respectively, P<0.05) whereas transfer of B-cells did not (13%). The presence of T-cells and solid cholesterol monohydrate crystals induced proinflammatory cytokine expression in the gallbladder. These studies indicate that T-cells are critical in murine cholelithogenesis and function by promoting gallbladder inflammation. In summary, these results illustrate that microbial pathogens can influence cholesterol gallstone formation; this most likely occurs by modulating the immune response with T-cells being a critical component in this immunomodulation.  Pathogenesis of the carcinogenic bacterium, Helicobacter pylori Gastric cancer is the second most common malignancy in the digestive system and the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Epidemiological data and experimental studies have identified several risk factors for gastric cancer, including Helicobacter pylori infection, low fruit and vegetable intake, N-nitrosoamine exposure, high salt diet, and smoking. Among these risk factors, H. pylori infection is the major cause of gastric cancer. Therefore, H. pylori has been classified as a type 1 (definite) carcinogen for gastric cancer by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1994. H. pylori colonizes the human stomach and has been definitively linked to chronic gastritis. Infection in some: susceptible individuals results in serious gastric disease such as peptic ulcer or gastric cancer. The first aim of this thesis was to examine the role of different T cell subpopulations in H. pylori gastritis. Using a murine adoptive transfer model, adoptive transfer of wildtype (wt) effector T cells (TE) into H. pylori-infected lymphopenic Rag2-/- recipient mice resulted in H. pylori-associated corpus gastritis superimposed with non-specific gastroduodenitis. Cotransfer with TE and regulatory T cells (TR) from wt or IL10-/- mice reduced gastroduodenitis, but only wt TR cells reduced corpus gastritis. (cont.) The second aim of this thesis was to evaluate the effect of vitamin C on H. pylori gastritis in vitamin C-deficient gulo-/- mice. It was found that a high vitamin C supplementation (3300 mg/L) in drinking water did not protect H. pylori gastritis, while a low vitamin C supplementation (33 mg/L) reduced the severity of H. pylori gastritis via an attenuated cellular immune response to H. pylori. The third aim of this thesis was to examine the role of DNA repair in H. pylori-associated gastric disease. We found that H. pylori-associated premalignant gastric atrophy was more severe in infected mice lacking DNA repair protein 3-alkyladenine DNA glycosylase or 06-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase in comparison to infected wt control mice. The forth aim of this thesis was to examine whether antimicrobial H. pylori eradication therapy could prevent gastric cancer development in INS-GAS mice, a model of gastric cancer. We found that antimicrobial H. pylori eradication therapy prevented the progression to gastric cancer in H. pylori-infected INS-GAS mice when treatment was instituted at an early stage of H. pylori infection. (cont.) In conclusion, these studies provide further insight into the role of host immune responses in H. pylori pathogenesis. Additionally, information was garnered regarding the roles of vitamin C supplementation, DNA repair proteins, and H. pylori eradication therapy in H. pylori-associated gastric disease using genetically manipulated mice.  Molecular pathogenesis of Helicobacter hepaticus induced liver disease Helicobacter hepaticus infection of A/JCr mice is a model of liver cancer resulting from chronic active inflammation. We monitored hepatic global gene expression profiles and correlated them to histological liver lesions in H. hepaticus infected and control male A/JCr mice at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year of age. We used an Affymetrix-based oligonucleotide microarray platform on the premise that a specific genetic expression signature at isolated time points would be indicative of disease status. Model based expression index comparisons generated by dChip yielded consistent profiles of differential gene expression for H. hepaticus infected male mice with progressive liver disease versus uninfected control mice within each age group. Linear discriminant analysis and principal component analysis allowed segregation of mice based on combined age and lesion status, or age alone. Up-regulated genes present throughout the 12 month study involved inflammation, tissue repair, and host immune function. Upregulation of putative tumor and proliferation markers correlated with advancing hepatocellular dysplasia. Transcriptionally down-regulated genes in mice with liver lesions included those related to peroxisome proliferator, cholesterol, and steroid metabolism pathways. Transcriptional profiling of hepatic genes documented gene expression signatures in the livers of H. hepaticus infected male A/JCr mice with chronic progressive hepatitis and preneoplastic liver lesions, complemented the histopathological diagnosis, and suggested molecular targets for the monitoring and intervention of disease progression prior to the onset of hepatocellular neoplasia. Our laboratory, in collaboration with Professors Suerbaum and Schauer, recently identified a (cont.) 70kb genomic island in Helicobacter hepaticus strain ATCC 51488 as a putative pathogenicity island (HhPAI) (Suerbaum et al, PNAS, 2003). This region within H. hepaticus contains genes HH0233-HH0302, a differential GC content, several long tandem repeats but no flanking repeats, and three components of a type IV secretion system (T4SS). A/JCr mice were experimentally infected with three naturally occurring strains of H. hepaticus including the type strain H. hepaticus ATCC 51488 strain (Hh 3B1) isolated from A/JCr mice, MIT 96-1809 (Hh NET) isolated from mice shipped from the Netherlands, and MIT-96-284 (HhG) isolated from mice acquired from Germany.4 HhNET (missing most of the HhPAI) infected male A/JCR mice exhibited a significantly lower prevalence (p<.05) of hepatic lesions at 6 months post infection than Hh 3B1 with an intact HhPAI. Hh G also has a large segment of the genomic island deleted, but not as many genes are deleted as compared to Hh NET. Hh G also demonstrated a lower prevalence of hepatic lesions. This variable pathological effect was evident in male mice only. The severity of chronic active inflammation in the liver of the H. hepaticus infected A/JCr mice depended on H. hepaticus liver colonization levels. The in vivo results support the presence of the HhPAI as a legitimate virulence determinant and predictor of severity of liver lesions in H. hepaticus infected A/JCr male mice. To further determine the differences in virulence of the H. hepaticus strains Hh 3B1, Hh NET, Hh G and an isogenic mutant H. ...

Urology has emerged as a unique field in which minimally invasive implantation techniques are available and such devices could provide improved beneficial therapies over conventional treatments. Urological indications for which localized drug therapy is already being advocated and investigated are highly suitable for treatment with implantable controlled release devices. This thesis describes the in vitro performance evaluation of an implantable, bio-resorbable device that can provide localized drug therapy of ciprofloxacin (CIP) to the seminal vesicle and nearby prostate gland for treatment of chronic prostatitis (CP). The device functions as an elementary osmotic pump (EOP) to release CIP for a period of 2-3 weeks after implantation in the seminal vesicle (SV) through transrectal needle injection or cystoscopic methods. The device is composed of an elastomeric, resorbable polymer cast in a tubular geometry with solid drug powder packed into its core and a micromachined release orifice drilled through its wall. Drug release experiments were performed to determine the effective release rate from a single orifice and the range of orifice size in which osmotic-controlled zero-order release was the dominant mechanism of drug delivery from the device. Device stability and function in an alkaline environment of similar pH to that of the SVs and infected prostate gland was also assessed in vitro. The device was found to function well in both de-ionized water and NaOH pH-8 solution with a sustained zero-order release rate of 2.47 ± 0.29 jtg/hr when fabricated with an orifice of diameter 100-150pm.

The presence of disordered myoarchitecture may in turn constitute the pathological basis of impaired cardiac mechanics in numerous clinical conditions, such as the remodeling heart following myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathies. To investigate the multi-scale nature of architectural disarray in the setting of myocardial disease, a dual imaging approach consisting of diffusion spectrum magnetic resonance imaging (DSI) and high-speed multislice two-photon microscopy (TPM) was used. DSI is a technique that derives fiber orientation from directionality of proton diffusion, whereas TPM derives cellular alignment from an autocorrelation of 3D resolved images of cells and subcellular structure. Mesoscale tract representations of myofiber orientation are generated from similarly aligned diffusion or autocorrelation vectors. These methods were applied to study induced myocardial infarction in the rat and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated with deletion of the gene for myosin binding protein C (cMyBP-C) in the mouse. Normal cardiac muscle fiber alignment within the ventricular wall was characterized by a series of helical tracts transitioning from a lefthanded orientation in the subepicardium to circumferential in the mid-myocardium to righthanded in the subendocardium. Infarcted hearts displayed a fiber void in the infarct zone and an extension of both subepicardial and subendocardial fibers beyond the border zone. It's hypothesized that the growth of fibers contributes to the remodeling process and provides tensile strength to the myocardium during contraction. (cont.) The hearts obtained from the cMyBP-C knockouts displayed significant myoarchitectural disarray characterized by a loss of voxel to voxel orientational coherence for fibers located from the mid-myocardium to subendocardium, resulting in a change in the transmural progression of remaining helical fibers. These observations suggest an association between cMyBP-C expression and cardiac fiber alignment, where variations in torsional rotation may constitute a mechanism for pump failure in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. These results substantiate the use of multi-scale imaging methods to enhance understanding of molecular and cellular contributions to tissue mechanical function.

Expression of either mutant receptor alone in Ba/F3 cells cannot elicit a signal in response to erythropoietin, but when co-expressed, there is a proliferative response and activation of the JAK2 Stat5 signaling pathway. A truncated erythropoietin receptor with only one cytosolic tyrosine (Y343), on only one receptor monomer is sufficient for signaling in response to erythropoietin, regardless of the monomer on which it is located. The same results apply to having only one conserved juxtamembrane hydrophobic L253 or W258 residue, essential for JAK2 activation, in the full-length receptor dimer. We conclude that despite asymmetry in the ligand-receptor dimer interaction, both sides are competent for signaling, and we suggest that the receptors signal equally. Transcriptional divergence and conservation of human and mouse erythropoiesis Mouse models have been used extensively for decades and have been instrumental in improving our understanding of mammalian erythropoiesis. Nonetheless, there are several examples of variation between human and mouse erythropoiesis. We performed a comparative global gene expression study using data from morphologically identical stage-matched sorted populations of human and mouse erythroid precursors from early to late erythroblasts. Induction and repression of major transcriptional regulators of erythropoiesis, as well as major erythroid-important proteins, are largely conserved between the species. In contrast, at a global level we identified a significant extent of divergence between the species, both at comparable stages and in the transitions between stages, especially for the 500 most highly expressed genes during development. This suggests that the response of multiple developmentally regulated genes to key erythroid transcriptional regulators represents an important modification that has occurred in the course of erythroid evolution. In developing a systematic framework to understand and study conservation and divergence between human and mouse erythropoiesis, we show how mouse models can fail to mimic specific human diseases and provide predictions for translating findings from mouse models to potential therapies for human disease.

In order to do this, we conducted a 3-day Value Stream Mapping workshop, during which we generated a map of the present value stream. We identified shortcomings and inefficiencies within this value stream, and then mapped out a future state Value Stream, creating a 90-day action plan to move towards that desired future state. This action plan relied heavily upon measuring and improving key performance indicators, which allowed us to make objective measures of our progress. A second internship objective was to reduce the number of clean room re-sanitizations. Currently, clean rooms undergo a costly and time-consuming re-sanitization whenever an air handler is shut down for a brief period of time. It is likely that some of these cleanings are unnecessary, and eliminating extraneous cleanings could reduce maintenance costs significantly. In order to reduce unnecessary clean room re-sanitizations, we designed and conducted a study to measure environmental standards during an air handler shutdown. Genzyme's Validation and Quality Control Departments approved this experimental plan prior to execution. We shut down an air handler that supplied a clean room, and monitored the air for viable and non-viable particles for several hours. Viable particulate levels did not exceed action limits during a four-hour shutdown, and non-viable particulates dropped to pre-experiment levels as soon as we re-started the air handler. Based on these results, we conclude that air-handler shutdowns should not require room re-sanitization.

        "text": "Cell and nanomaterial-based approaches for diagnosis and chemotherapy of metastatic cancer cells Metastasis is a multistep process during which tumor cells separate from a primary tumor, penetrate the bloodstream, evade host defenses, and colonize distant organs. This final and fatal step in tumor development is the cause of more than 90% of cancer related deaths. Therapies and diagnostics can be targeted to metastasis at three points in its progression: the primary tumor, the secondary tumor, and circulating tumor cells (CTCs). While much work has focused on primary tumors, less effort has concentrated on targeted isolation, detection and therapy of deeply penetrated metastases and CTCs. Here, I discuss cell and nanomaterial-based approaches for detecting and ablating these malignant populations. The number of CTCs in the blood directly correlates with disease progression; however, the lack of definitive markers has limited their isolation and characterization. I have demonstrated the potential use of platelets as a cell-based marker for isolation and detection of CTCs. Using phage display technology, it was possible to identify candidate peptides specific to mesenchymal-like tumor cells that may mimic the motile and aggressive CTC population. In order to detect and ablate metastases and CTCs, M13 bacteriophage was engineered into a platform for simultaneous tumor targeting, imaging, and therapy. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and doxorubicin, a chemotherapeutic agent, were loaded on phage for fluorescent near-infrared imaging and cytotoxicity of metastatic lesions, respectively. The near-infrared optical properties of SWNTs in the \"second window\" make them promising candidates for imaging nascent and deeply seeded tumors. This approach provides an 'all-in-one' platform for targeted fluorescence imaging and efficient drug delivery and may allow for real-time monitoring of tumor response to drug regimens.

Genetic engineering of bacteriophage and its applications for biomimetic materials Filamentous bacteriophage (M13) are excellent biological build block due to their multiple peptide display system including type 8 (complete peptide display at pVIII) and type 83 (complete peptide display at both pVIII and pIII) display systems. Unlike the phagemid systems, the advantage of these systems is that we can get homogenous peptide display on pVIII resulting in uniform placement of selected molecules as well as defined length and width. In this thesis, type 8 and type 83 phage were constructed and used as biological scaffolds to meet the following four specific aims. First, the self-assembly of engineered M13 bacteriophage as a template for Co-Pt crystals was demonstrated. An phage library with an octapeptide library on the major coat protein (pVIII) was used for selection of binders to cobalt ions. Fibrous structures with directionally ordered phage were obtained by interaction with cobalt ions. Co-Pt alloys were synthesized on the fibrous scaffold, and their magnetic properties were characterized. The mineralization showed organized nanoparticles on fibrous bundles with superparamagnetic properties. Second, an in vitro molecular selection method in non-biological conditions for inorganic synthesis was introduced. (cont.) A phage display peptide library which is resistant to ethanol was constructed and used for selection against titania in 90% ethanol. The selected peptide, with a conserved basic amino acid sequence, promotes nanoparticle formation (- 60 nm) during titania synthesis by the traditional sol-gel method. Third, storage of proteins in smectically aligned phage film was demonstrated. [Beta]-galactosidase and a green fluorescent protein variant were stored in the phage film with increased stability. In addition, streptavidin conjugated phycoerythrin were aligned in a SI phage film, in which streptavidin binding peptides are displayed at the end of the phage particles. The alignment showed increased fluorescent intensity of phycoerythrin molecules. Finally, the potential of type 8 and type 83 phage as a nano-structural scaffold were studied 'or device application. An Au binding peptide was selected using type 8 phage library. Self-assembly of gold particles on phage was observed. In addition, type 83 phage which display both streptavidin binding peptide at pIII and Au binding peptide at pVIII were constructed for complex assembly of both Au nanoparticles and streptavidin conjugated nanoparticles. Genetically engineered bacteriophage show promise for application including biologically compatible materials and functional bio-inorganic hybrid materials.  Towards rational design of peptides for selective interaction with inorganic materials Utilizing molecular recognition and self-assembly, material-specific biomolecules have shown great promise for engineering and ordering materials at the nanoscale. These molecules, inspired from natural biomineralization systems, are now commonly selected against non-natural inorganic materials through biopanning random combinatorial peptide libraries. Unfortunately, the challenge of studying the biological inorganic interface has slowed the understanding of interactions principles, and hence limited the number of downstream applications. This work focuses on the facile study of the peptide-inorganic interface using Yeast Surface Display. The general approach is to use combinatorial selection to suggest interaction principles followed by rational design to refine understanding. In this pursuit, two material groups-II-VI semiconductors and synthetic sapphire (metal oxides)-are chosen as inorganic targets due to their technological relevance and ease of study. First, yeast surface display (YSD) was established as a broadly applicable method for studying peptide-material interactions by screening a human scFv YSD library against cadmium sulfide (CdS), a II-VI semiconductor. The presence of multiple histidine residues was found to be necessary for mediating cell binding to CdS. As a follow-up, a systematic screen with yeast displayed rationally designed peptides was performed on a panel of II-VI semiconductors and gold. Cell binding results indicated that peptide interaction was mediated by a limited number of amino acids that were influenced by locally situated residues. Interpretation of the results facilitated design of new peptides with desired material specificities. Next, the nature of peptide/metal oxide binding interface was interrogated using sapphire crystalline faces as model surfaces. (cont.) Biopanning a random peptide YSD library and subsequent characterization of the identified binding partners revealed the importance of multiple basic amino acids in the binding event. Study of rationally designed basic peptides revealed a preference for those amino acids to be spaced in such a manner that maximized simultaneous interaction with the surface. Fusing peptides to maltose binding protein (MBP) allowed for quantitative affinity measurement with the best peptides having low nanomolar equilibrium dissociation constants.

        "text": "A new mouse model to probe the role of aflatoxin B₁ in liver carcinogenesis One and a half million new cancer cases are reported each year in the United States. Despite this overwhelming burden of disease, current preventative treatments and early detection techniques are inadequate. With cancers, as with many aggressive diseases, time is of the essence; earlier detection begets better patient prognoses. While contemporary technology offers physicians the ability to battle cancers via stage-one detection, few reliable biomarkers have been developed to assist in detection of upstream tumorigenesis or interpretation of early genomic assault. The objective of the work described here is to identify early biomarkers specific to tumorigenesis, which correlate with initial genomic assault and subsequent mutation in the gpt-delta (B6C3F1) mouse model. The test compound used in this work is aflatoxin B₁, a known human carcinogen produced by fungal spoilage of food materials. Aflatoxin B₁ was one of the carcinogens used in the \"training set\" of compounds that defined the B6C3F1 animal model. My work had three goals with regard to upgrading this model as a tool for contemporary toxicology. In the first part of the thesis, a kinetic profile was generated of AFB 1-DNA adduct formation and removal. In the second part of the work, adduct levels and specific DNA damage patterns of males and females were compared (males are generally more sensitive than females to this and other toxins). Third, nursing mother mice were treated with two chemo-preventive agents in an attempt to determine if chemoprevention of the dam would lead to protection of her children. This thesis documents generation of a 48-hour time-course assessing adductburden in four-day-old B6C3F1 neonates. These burdens are measured in adducts per mega-base of genomic DNA (based on a single 6mg/kg dose of AFB₁). As previous studies show that 6mg/kg at this age results in near 100% liver tumorigenesis, this timecourse provides significant intuition for the onset and persistence of DNA damage. The results showed that AFB₁-N7-Guanine adduct formation maximized at two hours post dosing and then decreased rapidly; its FAPY derivative proved to be much more stable with time. A slight excess adduct burden was observed in males from 2-48 hours post dosing. Systematic differences in gene expression were observed in nursing female mother mice that were either treated or not with R,S-sulforaphane or D3T (3H-1,2- dithiole-3-thione). While minimal gene expression changes were observed in pups nursed by a 2mg R,S-sulforaphane treated dam, those nursing from a 5mg R,S-sulforaphane treated mother experienced much greater effects. At 300 umol/kg doses of D3T to the mother, no statistically significant gene expression profile alterations were observed in the pups. The work described here did not identify conditions in which a chemopreventive pattern of gene expression in the mother could be transferred efficiently to her offspring.

        "text": "A modeling framework and toolset for simulation and characterization of the cochlea within the auditory system Purpose: This research develops a modeling approach and an implementation toolset to simulate reticular lamina displacement in response to excitation at the ear canal and to characterize the cochlear system in the frequency domain. Scope The study develops existing physical models covering the outer, middle, and inner ears. The range of models are passive linear, active linear, and active nonlinear. These models are formulated as differential algebraic equations, and solved for impulse and tone excitations to determine responses. The solutions are mapped into tuning characteristics as a function of position within the cochlear partition. Objectives The central objective of simulation is to determine the characteristic frequency (CF)-space map, equivalent rectangular bandwidth (ERB), and sharpness of tuning (QERB) of the cochlea. The focus of this research is on getting accurate characteristics, with high time and space resolution. The study compares the simulation results to empirical measurements and to predictions of a model that utilizes filter theory and coherent reflection theory. Method We develop lumped and distributed physical models based on mechanical, acoustic, and electrical phenomena. The models are structured in the form of differential-algebraic equations (DAE), discretized in the space domain. This is in contrast to existing methods that solve a set of algebraic equations discretized in both space and time. The DAEs are solved using numerical differentiation formulas (NDFs) to compute the displacement of the reticular lamina and intermediate variables such as displacement of stapes in response to impulse and tone excitations at the ear canal. The inputs and outputs of the cochlear partition are utilized in determining its resonances and tuning characteristics. Transfer functions of the cochlear system with impulse excitation are calculated for passive and active linear models to determine resonance and tuning of the cochlear partition. Output characteristics are utilized for linear systems with tone excitation and for nonlinear models with stimuli of various amplitudes. Stability of the system is determined using generalized eigenvalues and the individual subsystems are stabilized based on their poles and zeros. Results The passive system has CF map ranging from 20 kHz at the base to 10 Hz at the apex of the cochlear partition, and has the strongest resonant frequency corresponding to that of the middle ear. The ERB is on the order of the CF, and the QERB is on the order of 1. The group delay decreases with CF which is in contradiction with findings from Stimulus Frequency Otoacoustic Emissions (SFOAE) experiments. The tuning characteristics of the middle ear correspond well to experimental observations. The stability of the system varies greatly with the choice of parameters, and number of space sections used for both the passive and active implementations. Implication Estimates of cochlear partition tuning based on solution of differential algebraic equations have better time and space resolution compared to existing methods that solve discretized set of equations. Domination of the resonance frequency of the reticular lamina by that of the middle ear rather than the resonant frequency of the cochlea at that position for the passive model is in contradiction with Bekesys measurements on human cadavers. Conclusion The methodology used in the thesis demonstrate the benefits of developing models and formulating the problem as differential-algebraic equations and solving it using the NDFs. Such an approach facilitates computation of responses and transfer functions simultaneously, studying stability of the system, and has good accuracy (controlled directly by error tolerance) and resolution.

Conventional treatments including the chemotherapeutic agent, Tamoxifen, have had only limited success, often showing uncomfortable side effects. Our group has proposed a new scheme for a rational drug design. This scheme utilizes recent findings on the mechanism of cisplatin, the drug found to cure in excess of 93% of all testicular cancer cases. Cisplatin forms DNA adducts that are toxic. The toxicity of these adducts is enhanced by the recruitment of proteins that bind to the adducts and impede adduct repair. This thesis was an attempt to duplicate this \"repair shielding\" mechanism with another cytotoxin. Specifically, this toxin will be programmed to kill breast cancer cells. Breast cancer cells often overexpress the estrogen receptor protein. By synthesizing a drug that not only binds and damages the DNA but also binds the abundant proteins in the cells, thereby blocking the damaged site from DNA repair proteins, a selective treatment of cancer cells can be achieved. In this study, the human estrogen receptor (hER) and the ligand binding domain of the hER genes were cloned into baculovirus expression vectors, establishing a system where a large quantity of the proteins can be expressed. The proteins expressed in insect cells were purified in one step, using the FLAG-epitope, yielding homogeneous proteins. The proteins were tested for binding to p-estradiol and were confirmed to be functional in ligand binding. They were also tested for their ability to bind the novel drugs synthesized to bind both the protein and the DNA. It was found that the ligand binding domain of the hER was capable of binding the drugs adducted to the DNA. In an effort to elucidate the mechanism of the protein-drug-DNA complex formation, an association experiment was carried out, which showed that the drug more readily bound to the protein than to DNA. However, a significant amount of the drug-protein complex still bound the DNA, if the ratio of the protein to the drug did not exceed 1.5. Design and synthesis of inhibitors of dTDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydrate (Rm1B), and enzyme required for dTDP-L-rhamnose production in M. tuberculosis The purpose of this work is to probe the dTDP-L-rhamnose pathway in an effort to develop small molecule inhibitors that could act as therapeutics for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The necessity for newer, more effective treatments for tuberculosis is growing, as the bacteria evolve resistance to traditional treatments. In an effort to develop more effective and perhaps more abbreviated courses of treatment, a plan was developed to investigate a pathway involved in cell wall biosynthesis as a promising target: the dTDP-L-rhamnose pathway. This pathway plays an essential role in linking the peptidoglycan and arabinogalactan portions of the mycolic acid-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex, a significant part of the mycobacterial cell wall. The mounting level of biochemical understanding of this pathway and its importance in bacterial cell wall biosynthesis indicates that it is not only a relevant target but also an accessible one. Of the four enzymes crucial to this biosynthetic pathway, one was chosen as the primary focus: dTDP-D-glucose-4,6- dehydratase (RmlB). There are 3 steps in the reaction mechanism of RmlB: oxidation of the C4 position of dTDP-D-glucose to form a 4-keto structure, dehydration of the C6 position via the elimination of water and a subsequent reduction to result in a 6-deoxy product. Crystal structures of this particular enzyme, dTDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase (RmlB), complexed with single substrates or substrate analogs have provided a foundation for these studies, enabling the rational design of a small library of potential inhibitors. Twelve mechanism-based inhibitors of RmlB are proposed. These compounds reflect the current understanding of the mechanism and mimic the sugar portion of the sugar-nucleotide substrate at various steps throughout the reaction mechanism. Each of the proposed inhibitors is designed to inhibit one of the specific steps of the mechanism. While the intention of this project is to synthesize each compound in this library from commercially available starting materials in 15 steps or less, the primary goal of this particular dissertation is to synthesize 3 of the 12 proposed inhibitors from the commercially available starting material 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol.

The toxicity and mutagenicity of the aflatoxin B₁ formamidopyrimidine DNA adduct Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a fungal metabolite that contaminates the food supply in certain areas of the world. It is produced by Aspergillusflavus and related fungi that grow on improperly stored foods such as corn, rice, and peanuts. Epidemiological studies have shown a correlation between exposure to AFBI and incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Mutations in p53 are observed in over 50% of the HCC samples studied, and a unique mutational hotspot occurs at the third position of codon 249 in this gene, yielding almost exclusively GC to TA transversions. It is of interest to evaluate the mutagenic properties of specific chemical structures of AFBI adducts in order to determine which of these may be responsible for the mutations that may play a role in the formation of HCC. The primary DNA adduct formed by the epoxide of AFB is the 8,9-dihydro-8-(N7-guanyl)-9-hydroxyaflatoxin B1 (AFBI-N7-Gua) adduct, which can lead to two secondary lesions, an apurinic site or a ring opened formamidopyrimidine (FAPY) adduct, which itself has two rotameric forms. This study focuses on of the determination of how well cells tolerate each of the AFB1-FAPY rotamers and of the type and frequency of mutations caused by the persistent AFB I-FAPY adduct in a site specifically modified M13 viral vector transfected into E. coli. Four major results were concluded from this work. First, one of the rotamers of AFBI-FAPY is a strong block to DNA replication, even when bypass polymerases are employed by the cell. (cont.) Second, the G to T mutation frequency of the AFB I-FAPY adduct is at least six fold greater than that observed for the AFBi-N7-Gua adduct. Third, a spectrum of mutations that is unique to the AFBI-FAPY adduct was observed. Fourth, cell strains expressing different bypass polymerases responded differently when challenged with the AFB1-FAPY and AFBI-N7-Gua DNA adducts. These results show that AFB I-FAPY is the most toxic and mutagenic species of aflatoxin adduct studied to date.  Cisplatin cytotoxicity associated with tetracycline resistance determinants in Escherichia coli Tetracyclines, a broad-spectrum class of antibiotics, were discovered in the late 1940s, and became widely used because of their important advantages: they are inexpensive, safe, demonstrate good oral absorption, and are active against a broad range of bacterial pathogens. Unfortunately, as with most antibiotics, the emergence of microbial resistance to tetracyclines has become a serious problem. Today, most genera examined have tetracycline-resistant isolates, although the percentage varies according to species and geographic location. Due to the emergence of resistance, tetracyclines are no longer the antibiotics of choice in treatment of many conditions, although they are still extensively used to treat a variety of bacterial infections. Substantial research efforts have been directed towards reversing tetracycline resistance in bacteria. This work describes the development of a novel anti-bacterial treatment for diseases caused by bacteria resistant to tetracycline. It was found that tetracycline-resistant bacteria expressing the TnlO gene of tetracycline resistance, upon induction with tetracycline, became extremely susceptible to destruction by the DNA-damaging anti-cancer drug cisplatin. Tetracycline-resistant bacteria grown in tetracycline and subsequently treated with cisplatin in the presence of tetracycline were killed about 10⁵-fold more effectively than wild-type bacteria and tetracycline-resistant bacteria not exposed to tetracycline. This phenomenon was observed in different strains of tetracycline-resistant E. coli. Other antibiotics tested with respective antibiotic-resistant bacteria did not produce the same effect of sensitization to cisplatin, suggesting a unique relationship among cisplatin, tetracycline and the tetracycline resistance (cont.) gene. It was determined that levels of platinum DNA damage were higher in sensitized tetracycline-resistant cells than in wild-type cells, although total cellular platinum levels in sensitized tetracycline-resistant cells were not increased. At this time, the mechanism of increased DNA damage formation and the mechanism underlying sensitization to cisplatin are still matters of speculation. The experiments reported here, however, demonstrate that cells expressing the genes of tetracycline resistance actually became primary targets for destruction by cisplatin. Based on this study, it is suggested that the therapeutic power of the tetracyclines could be restored and enhanced by using a complementary drug that, in combination with tetracycline, would induce selective destruction of tetracycline-resistant bacteria.  The role of mismatch repair in mediating cellular sensitivity to cisplatin : the Escherichia coli methyl-directed repair paradigm The anticancer drug cisplatin is in widespread use but its mechanism of action is only poorly understood. Moreover, human cancers acquire resistance to the drug, which limits its clinical utility. A paradox in the field is how loss of mismatch DNA repair leads to clinical resistance to this widely used drug. The phenomenon of cisplatin tolerance in mismatch repair deficient cells was initially discovered in E. coli, where methylation deficient dam mutants show high sensitivity to cisplatin and dam mutants with an additional mutation in either of the mismatch repair genes mutS or mutL show near wildtype levels of resistance. A prevalent explanation for this observation is the abortive repair model, which proposes that in dam mutants, where the strand discrimination signal is lost, mismatch repair attempts futile cycles of repair opposite cisplatin-DNA adducts. Previous findings have supported this model to the extent that MutS, the E. coli mismatch recognition protein, specifically recognizes DNA modified with cisplatin. However it has recently been shown that MutS binding to cisplatin adducts may contribute to toxicity by instead preventing the recombinational repair of a cisplatin-modified substrate, and we have previously shown that recombination is an essential mechanism for tolerating cisplatin damage. (cont.) In the present study, we examined the global transcriptional responses of wildtype, dam, dam mutS, and mutS mutant E. coli after treatment with a toxic dose of cisplatin. We also determined any dose-response at the transcriptional level of several SOS response genes and other genes involved in DNA repair by real time RT-PCR. Furthermore, we performed single-cell electrophoresis in order to determine the effect of mismatch repair on the level of double-strand break formation in cisplatin-treated cells. Our results show that Dam-deficient strains exhibit unique gene regulation that may be due to mismatch-repair induced DNA damage in the absence of adenine methylation. In addition, cisplatin treatment induces double-strand break formation and the SOS response in a dose-dependent manner, and both break formation and the SOS response are greatest in the hypersensitive dam mutant strain. The higher level of cisplatin-induced double-strand breaks in the dam mutant may be dependent on functional mismatch repair.  The toxicity and mutagenicity of the aflatoxin B₁ formamidopyrimidine DNA adduct Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a fungal metabolite that contaminates the food supply in certain areas of the world. It is produced by Aspergillusflavus and related fungi that grow on improperly stored foods such as corn, rice, and peanuts. Epidemiological studies have shown a correlation between exposure to AFBI and incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Mutations in p53 are observed in over 50% of the HCC samples studied, and a unique mutational hotspot occurs at the third position of codon 249 in this gene, yielding almost exclusively GC to TA transversions. It is of interest to evaluate the mutagenic properties of specific chemical structures of AFBI adducts in order to determine which of these may be responsible for the mutations that may play a role in the formation of HCC. The primary DNA adduct formed by the epoxide of AFB is the 8,9-dihydro-8-(N7-guanyl)-9-hydroxyaflatoxin B1 (AFBI-N7-Gua) adduct, which can lead to two secondary lesions, an apurinic site or a ring opened formamidopyrimidine (FAPY) adduct, which itself has two rotameric forms. This study focuses on of the determination of how well cells tolerate each of the AFB1-FAPY rotamers and of the type and frequency of mutations caused by the persistent AFB I-FAPY adduct in a site specifically modified M13 viral vector transfected into E. coli. Four major results were concluded from this work. First, one of the rotamers of AFBI-FAPY is a strong block to DNA replication, even when bypass polymerases are employed by the cell. (cont.) Second, the G to T mutation frequency of the AFB I-FAPY adduct is at least six fold greater than that observed for the AFBi-N7-Gua adduct. Third, a spectrum of mutations that is unique to the AFBI-FAPY adduct was observed. Fourth, cell strains expressing different bypass polymerases responded differently when challenged with the AFB1-FAPY and AFBI-N7-Gua DNA adducts. These results show that AFB I-FAPY is the most toxic and mutagenic species of aflatoxin adduct studied to date.  Cisplatin cytotoxicity associated with tetracycline resistance determinants in Escherichia coli Tetracyclines, a broad-spectrum class of antibiotics, were discovered in the late 1940s, and became widely used because of their important advantages: they are inexpensive, safe, demonstrate good oral absorption, and are active against a broad range of bacterial pathogens. Unfortunately, as with most antibiotics, the emergence of microbial resistance to tetracyclines has become a serious problem. Today, most genera examined have tetracycline-resistant isolates, although the percentage varies according to species and geographic location. Due to the emergence of resistance, tetracyclines are no longer the antibiotics of choice in treatment of many conditions, although they are still extensively used to treat a variety of bacterial infections. Substantial research efforts have been directed towards reversing tetracycline resistance in bacteria. This work describes the development of a novel anti-bacterial treatment for diseases caused by bacteria resistant to tetracycline. It was found that tetracycline-resistant bacteria expressing the TnlO gene of tetracycline resistance, upon induction with tetracycline, became extremely susceptible to destruction by the DNA-damaging anti-cancer drug cisplatin. Tetracycline-resistant bacteria grown in tetracycline and subsequently treated with cisplatin in the presence of tetracycline were killed about 10⁵-fold more effectively than wild-type bacteria and tetracycline-resistant bacteria not exposed to tetracycline. This phenomenon was observed in different strains of tetracycline-resistant E. coli. Other antibiotics tested with respective antibiotic-resistant bacteria did not produce the same effect of sensitization to cisplatin, suggesting a unique relationship among cisplatin, tetracycline and the tetracycline resistance (cont.) gene. It was determined that levels of platinum DNA damage were higher in sensitized tetracycline-resistant cells than in wild-type cells, although total cellular platinum levels in sensitized tetracycline-resistant cells were not increased. At this time, the mechanism of increased DNA damage formation and the mechanism underlying sensitization to cisplatin are still matters of speculation. The experiments reported here, however, demonstrate that cells expressing the genes of tetracycline resistance actually became primary targets for destruction by cisplatin. Based on this study, it is suggested that the therapeutic power of the tetracyclines could be restored and enhanced by using a complementary drug that, in combination with tetracycline, would induce selective destruction of tetracycline-resistant bacteria.

These commercially available prostheses are intrinsically controlled. Users cannot intuitively change ankle controller's behavior to perform movements that are not part of the repetitive walking gait cycle. For example, when transition from level ground walking to descending stairs, user cannot intuitively initiate or control the amount of ankle angle deflexion for a more normative stair descent gait pattern. This paper presents a hybrid controller that adds myoelectric control functionality to an existing intrinsic controller. The system employs input from both mechanical sensors on the ankle as well as myoelectric signals from gastrocnemius muscle of the user. This control scheme lets the user to modulate the gain of command ankle torque upon push off during level ground walking and stair ascent. It also allows the user to interrupt level ground walking control cycle and initiate ankle plantar flexion during stair descent. As a preliminary study, ankle characteristics such as ankle angle and torque were measured and compared to biological ankle characteristics. Results show that the proposed hybrid controller can maintain existing controller's biomimetic characteristics. In addition, it can also recognize to a qualitative extent the intended command torque for ankle push off and user's desire to switch between control modalities for different terrains. The study shows that it is possible and desirable to use neural signals as control signals for prosthetic leg controllers.

        "text": "Cervical mucus prorperties stratifv risk for preterm birth Preterm birth impacts 15 million babies every year, leading to morbidity, mortality, significant health care costs, and lifelong consequences. The causes of preterm birth are unknown, resulting in ineffective treatment, but it is correlated with ascension of vaginal bacteria through the cervix, which is normally protected by a dense mucus plug during pregnancy. This mucus plug, consisting of a tight meshwork of glycoproteins called mucins, should prevent pathogens from accessing the sterile uterine environment. Cervical mucus from women at high risk and low risk for preterm birth was collected and compared. The aim of this study was to discover differences that will lead to clues about why preterm birth occurs, and ultimately what can be done about it in terms of prevention and intervention. Using rheological techniques and a translocation assay, we found that cervical mucus from women at high risk is more translucent and more elastic under both elongational and shear stress, than cervical mucus in normal pregnancies. These properties more closely resemble mucus during ovulation, when spermatozoa can most easily penetrate the barrier, than mucus in normal pregnancy. Furthermore, high risk mucus is more permeable to beads of comparable size to viruses, suggesting the barrier is weakened and foreign particles may harmfully traverse it to cause intrauterine infection. The techniques in this paper have not been previously used to study cervical mucus in the context of preterm labor, but their results may have important implications. If these mucus properties in women indeed permit increased bacterial infection through the cervix, then they can be used to stratify patients, allowing for more personalized prenatal care to lower the rate of preterm birth.

While this system is crucial for nutrient absorption, any derangements in the proliferative cells can quickly lead to cancer. In this thesis, we sought to better understand the behavioral and genetic characteristics of the different cell types along the intestinal crypt, in a mouse model. We first attempted to quantify the migration velocities and proliferative rates at a single-cell level using 5-ethynol-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) pulse-chase labeling. While we observed marked differences in the proliferation rates between the absorptive and secretory lineages (the former is faster), our experimental setup was unable to resolve any possible differences in migratory behaviors. We then turned our attention to quantifying the spatial expression patterns of selected transcripts in the intestinal crypt, both in wildtype and in an inducible APC-loss cancer model. We were able to show that the transcript expression profiles of key differentiation and proliferation markers (Creb313, Gob5, Ki-67, cMyc), as well as the ephrin signaling (EphB2 and EphrinBl) were significantly altered in the early stages (7 days) of adenoma formation. A more detailed analysis also separated this derangement in terms of extrinsic factors (e.g. altered cell composition along the crypt) and intrinsic factors (e.g. inherent change of cellular expression profile after APC loss). What is particularly interesting is that even differentiated cells in adenomas can exhibit such derangements. Our hypothesis to explain this observation is that these differentiated cells actually come from transformed stem cells. To test this hypothesis, we needed to verify that these cells indeed have excision at the Apc locus. After several approaches involving both single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the results were ultimately inconclusive. However, we propose several additional approaches that this hypothesis can be verified, and if verified, some biologically significant questions that can be addressed regarding the early dynamics of stem cells in intestinal cancer development.

Direct nerve Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) induces muscles to contract by electrically stimulating nerves, which shows promise for clinical applications in restoring muscle function in SC. However, Functional Electrical Stimulation is limited by the lack of graded response in muscle contraction and by high fatigability due to the reversal of recruitment order of motor units. Previous work showed that ion-selective membranes can be used to modulate Ca 2 ions in situ, decreasing the current threshold for nerve stimulation and eliciting a more graded muscle contraction response. This work developed polyimide-based cuff ion-selective electrodes to enable the future application of this technique in vivo. The developed electrodes were flexible, elastic and conductive. In vitro tests of the electrodes by stimulation of frog sciatic nerve reproduced the decrease in stimulation current threshold, which had been observed in planar glass-based electrodes, in the flexible polyimide-based electrodes. Additionally, cuffing the stimulated nerves with ion-selective electrodes was more effective at decreasing current threshold than planar stimulation. This work also analyzed data on twitch width, contraction time and relaxation time to infer effects of ion-selective electrodes on recruitment order. Stimulation with the ion-selective electrodes had higher twitch width, contraction time and relaxation time than traditional electrical stimulation at all force levels. The difference was particularly high at low force levels, indicating an effect of Calcium ion depletion on recruitment order.

In a simple circuit with one constitutively expressed protein and one protein whose expression is inducible, it has been shown that inducing the expression of the second protein causes a significant decrease in the level of the first. In this thesis, we explore the possibility of reducing the effects of resource limitations by adding a high-gain negative feedback loop to one of the circuits. The loop includes an sRNA construct. We explore different implementations of this circuit and model them mechanistically. Furthermore, we begin physically implementing one of the circuit designs by testing intermediate constructs. Finally, we also explore the hypothesis that exogenous circuits on plasmids compete for a pool of resources that is spatially separated from the resources that the genome utilizes.

There is no approved vaccine to prevent this disease, and resistance to available antimalarial drugs is becoming widespread. Identification of parasite genes essential to survival and virulence could facilitate the development of novel therapeutics and vaccines. However, these efforts have been impeded by difficulties in manipulating the parasite's genome and functionally perturbing gene expression in a controlled way. Our lab has developed inducible systems to control P. falciparum gene expression, and has achieved successful editing of the P. falciparum genome using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. We have integrated these capabilities into a modular and scalable framework that can be used to efficiently edit, regulate and delete any target parasite gene after a single genome editing operation. This approach will accelerate studies of parasite gene function, and help prioritize potential drug and vaccine targets. A key requirement in this framework is the efficient assembly of donor vectors for modifying target loci and installing the necessary regulatory parts. This necessitates cloning several large, [A+T]-rich P.falciparum genomic regions that can be quite tedious and rate limiting. In this document, we show a new cloning strategy using linear vectors that facilitates rapid and accurate assembly of vectors capable of transforming P. falciparum. We present evidence of successful chromosomal modification of several genes via spontaneous single crossover, as well as zinc finger nuclease- and Cas9- mediated genome editing strategies using our assembled donor vectors. We also show that these modifications enable controllable expression of several previously uncharacterized genes to elicit phenotypes that we are investigating in further mechanistic detail. Importantly, these transgenic parasites can now be rapidly generated to allow identification of novel essential parasite genes in as little as a month.

This thesis describes a streamlined workflow for analyzing transcriptomic data. This streamlined workflow not only reduced the barrier to conducting the analysis but also reduced the analysis cycle time. With the use of this workflow, a number of historical Amgen microarray datasets were mined to identify gene expression signatures indicative of productivity. The result of this mining identified key biological pathways specific to a highly productive Amgen cell line. This work suggests that these pathways are critical to heightened levels of protein production.

In order to improve these treatments and engineer novel therapies, it is crucial that we increase our understanding of how these antibiotics interact with cellular metabolism. Evidence is increasingly building that the efficacy of antibiotics relies critically on downstream metabolic effects, in addition to inhibition of primary targets. Here we present a novel computational pipeline to expedite investigation of these effects: we combine computational modelling of metabolic networks with data from experimental screens on antibiotic susceptibility to identify metabolic vulnerabilities that can enhance antibiotic efficacy. This approach utilizes genome-scale metabolic models of bacterial metabolism to simulate the reaction-level response of cellular metabolism to a metabolite counter screen. The simulated results are then integrated with experimentally determined antibiotic sensitivity measurements using machine learning. Following integration, a mechanistic understanding of the phenotype-level antibiotic sensitivity results can be extracted. These mechanisms further support the role of metabolism in the mechanism of action of antibiotic lethality. Consistent with current understanding, application of the pipeline to M. tuberculosis identified cysteine metabolism, ATP synthase, and the citric acid cycle as key pathways in determining antibiotic efficacy. Additionally, roles for metabolism of aromatic amino acids and biosynthesis of polyprenoids were identified as pathways meriting further investigation.

The first of these models describes the indentation on polydimethylsiloxane bilayer composites, with the aim of describing the relative effects of a adhesion and viscoelastic properties on the measured deformation response. That model expands on this objective via the analysis of the effects of surface adhesion commonly associated with highly compliant polymers and tissues. The second model attempts to replicate impact of a high velocity projectile on a relatively stiff material, polyurethane urea, and on a comparatively compliant polymer, gelatin hydrogel.

Since these mechanosensors have been speculated to be located in several cellular domains including the cell membrane, the cytoskeleton, and the nucleus, it is necessary to achieve a detailed understanding of subcellular mechanics. In this work, we present novel methods to independently quantify cytoskeletal displacements, mechanical coupling between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix, and nuclear mechanics based on high resolution tracking of cellular structures and receptor bound magnetic beads in response to applied strain or microscopic forces. These methods were applied to study the effects of several human disease associated mutations on subcellular mechanics and to examine the interaction between known protein function and specific changes in cellular mechanical properties and mechanotransduction pathways. Initial experiments were targeted to the role of membrane adhesion receptors. Experiments with cells expressing a mutant form of the integrin-associated molecule tetraspanin CD151 revealed that CD151 plays a key role in selectively strengthening α6βl integrin-mediated adhesion to laminin-1. We then studied cytoplasmic behavior using cells from mice with an αB-Crystallin mutation (R120G) that causes desmin-related myopathy. These studies showed impaired passive cytoskeletal mechanics in adult mouse cardiac myocytes.

We then studied cytoplasmic behavior using cells from mice with an αB-Crystallin mutation (R120G) that causes desmin-related myopathy. These studies showed impaired passive cytoskeletal mechanics in adult mouse cardiac myocytes. Finally, we studied cells deficient in the nuclear envelope (cont.) protein lamin A/C and showed that lamin A/C deficient cells have increased nuclear deformation, defective mechanotransduction, and impaired viability under mechanical strain, suggesting that the tissue specific effects observed in laminopathies such as Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy or Hutchinson-Gilford progeria may arise from varying degrees of impaired nuclear mechanics and transcriptional regulation. In conclusion, our methods provide new and valuable tools to examine the role of subcellular biomechanics on mechanotransduction in normal and mutant cells, leading to improved understanding of disease mechanisms associated with altered cell mechanics.

        "text": "Development of a collagen gel sandwich hepatocyte bioreactor for detecting hepatotoxicity of drugs and chemicals Understanding the hepatotoxicity of drugs and chemicals is essential for progress in academic research, medical science and in the development of new pharmaceuticals. Studying hepatotoxicity in vitro is a challenging task because hepatocytes, the metabolically active cells of the liver, are very difficult to maintain in culture. After just 24 hours, the cells detach from the plate and die, and even if they survive they usually do not express the metabolic functions which they have in vivo. It has been observed by others that culturing hepatocytes between two layers of collagen type I maintains in vivo-like morphology and also many drug metabolizing enzymes for weeks. In spite of the research examining drug metabolism in collagen sandwiches, there are very few studies evaluating this system for investigating hepatotoxicity. We cultured primary rat hepatocytes in the collagen sandwich configuration and our goal was to optimize this system for long-term studies and to examine toxicity of a variety of hepatotoxins. By measuring secretions of urea and albumin, and P4501A activity, we determined the optimal cell density to be 50,000 cells/cm2. We also evaluated the need for epidermal growth factor (EGF) in our cultures, by comparing urea and albumin secretions in cultures grown with and without EGF. The cultures without EGF had significantly less secretion of both urea and albumin just two days after plating. Therefore, we decided to include EGF in the medium. The toxins we examined were aflatoxin B1, acetaminophen, carbon tetrachloride, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), methyl methane sulfonate (MMS), cadmium, vinyl acetate and dimethylformamide (DMF). The cells were sensitive to aflatoxin B1, MMS, MNNG and cadmium. However, they were (cont.) immune to acetaminophen, carbon tetrachloride, vinyl acetate and DMF. Our Western Blots showed that CYP1A, 2B and 3A were maintained in the culture for a week, but CYP2E1 was lost gradually over time. CYP2E1 is also the primary metabolic enzyme for acetaminophen, carbon tetrachloride and DMF. Thus, it is possible that the lack of toxicity is due to the loss of the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of these compounds. Immunity to vinyl acetate suggests that carboxylesterase is also lost in culture, since this enzyme is the one which converts vinyl acetate to acetaldehyde. The metabolism of acetaminophen was also examined with liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Liquid chromatography showed that acetaminophen is metabolized primarily to the sulfate and glucuronide metabolites. In order to investigate whether the glutathione adduct was formed, we synthesized the adduct and determined its retention time with liquid chromatography and its fragmentation pattern with mass spectrometry. We isolated the fraction with the same retention time from the medium of acetaminophen-treated cells, and showed that it contains a peak with the same mass to charge ratio and fragmentation pattern as the glutathione adduct. We also examined the conditioned medium from the hepatocytes to investigate the secreted protein profile, which could potentially be used to find toxicity biomarkers. We were able to remove most of the albumin from the medium using an immuno-affinity column containing anti-albumin antibodies bound to protein A-agarose beads ...  Nitric oxide : cellular effects in vitro and in vivo The overall aim of this project was to investigate various cellular responses and toxic effects of nitric oxide, NO' and in vitro and in vivo. Nitric oxide gives rise to a complex spectrum of reactive species in oxygenated solution. The complexity of nitric oxide's chemistry is recapitulated in its effects on cells. Exposure to nitric oxide can result in changes on many different levels in cells ranging from protein and DNA damage, to damage to organelles and changes in gene expression, and even in cell death. Many models to study nitric oxide have been developed and will be used to study various responses to nitric oxide and related species. Nitric oxide and peroxynitrite-induced cellular damage has been and continues to be studied extensively using in vitro systems. Two systems have been used in this project, a delivery system for NO' as well as a cell line, which produces NO'. A SilasticÊ¾ membrane delivery system can be used to treat bacteria or cells to mimic in vivo exposure to nitric oxide. Mutations induced by nitric oxide in a set of Salmonella tester strains can be studied utilizing this delivery system. Activated RAW264.7 macrophage cells have been used as an in vitro model of nitric oxide production and cytotoxicity SJL/J mice bearing the transplantable lymphoma RcsX have been established as an in vivo model of nitric oxide production and toxicity. (cont.) This in vivo mouse model can be used to test results found in vitro. Specifically, the relationship between nitric oxide production and prostaglandin synthesis and glutathione homeostasis can be explored. Glutathione was found to be induced by nitric oxide production in this model, and this increase was due to increases in y-glutamylcysteinyl synthetase activity. This thesis studied both the regulatory and toxic effects of nitric oxide, both endogenously produced and from exogenous sources.  Regulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced apoptosis via posttranslational modifications in a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (cont.) phosphoproteomics technology, IMAC/LC/MS/MS, [approximately] 200 phosphosites were identified from HT-29 cells, some of which were detected only from insulin-treated cells. Our phosphoproteomics approach also enabled us to detect alteration of both known and unknown phosphorylation states of apoptosis-related proteins at two time points during early apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-α Apoptosis, a physiologically regulated cell death, plays critical roles in development and immune system by maintaining tissue homeostasis. The thesis project investigates regulations of apoptosis in a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, HT-29, exposed to diverse cellular stimuli, focusing on a specific protein as well as global level of proteins. The first part of the thesis demonstrated S-nitrosation of procaspase-9. S-nitrosation is a novel protein modification to regulate protein-protein interaction or protein activity. This modification has been implied to inactivate caspases. We could visualize S-nitrosation of an initiator caspase, procaspase-9, by enriching low-abundant procaspase-9 with immunoprecipitation and stabilizing S-nitroso-cysteine with biotin labeling. Nitric oxide synthase inhibitors and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) reduced the S-nitrosation level of procaspase-9, suggesting that S-nitrosation may be regulated by a nitric oxide synthase and denitrosation is likely a mechanism of apoptosis. The second part of the thesis is to examine survival effects of insulin on cells undergoing TNF-α-induced apoptosis. Insulin decreased the TNF-α-induced cleavage of key apoptotic mediators, caspases, and their substrates as well as apoptosis, in part, depending on phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K)/Akt pathway. One of protective mechanisms by insulin is likely to decrease the TNF-α-induced dissociation of a potent inhibitor of caspases, X-chromosome linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), from procaspase-9 via PI-3K/Akt pathway. Lack of phosphoproteomics data in HT-29 cells led the third part of the thesis to focus on investigating global level regulation of phosphoproteins during apoptosis. With a  Mechanisms of toxicity and carcinogenicity of three alkylanilines Alkyl-substituted anilines have been implicated as important etiological agents in human carcinogenesis. Specifically, 2,6-dimethylaniline (2,6-DMA), 3,5-dimethylaniline (3,5-DMA), and 3-ethylaniline (3EA) have been associated with an increased risk of human bladder cancer, independent of cigarette smoking, in a published case-control study. Understanding the metabolic activation of and DNA adduct formation by these chemicals is an important first step in elucidating their mechanisms of carcinogenesis and toxicity. Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism was profiled based on the hypothesis that N-hydroxylated metabolites are critical intermediates in the formation of DNA adducts. This work was extended to assess in vitro DNA adduct formation with the cell-free and cell-based assays. Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) was used for detection and semi-quantification of DNA adducts formed by 14C-labeled alkylanilines. Data indicated 3,5-DMA formed high levels of DNA adducts, suggesting that it is a potent carcinogen. Additionally, the levels of adducts exhibited inter-species variation. The effects of phase II metabolism on adduct formation were evaluated by comparing the results obtained from the two types of assays and by assessing the effects of phase II enzyme cofactors on the results of cell-free assay. (cont.) Results implied that sulfotransferase-mediated metabolism promotes cytotoxicity and mutagenicity of all three alkylanilines; however, glucuronidation may provide a protective mechanism. The effects of N-acetyltransferase-mediated metabolism on DNA adduct formation differed for the three alkylanilines; acetyl-CoA enhanced adduct formation by 3-EA and 2,6-DMA, but it reduced 3,5-DMA adduct formation. Human CYP2A6 universally catalyzed the oxidation of all structural isomers of dimethylanilines and ethylanilines, except 3-EA. In the present work, the hypothesis that 3-EA is a mechanism-based inactivator toward human P450 2A6 through covalent binding was examined by using AMS. 3-EA was characterized as a mechanism-based inactivator with a Ki of 34 !iM and a kinact of 0.055 min'. Results suggest that 3-EA might be involved in more than one biological effect in the human body through multiple pathways. Adduct formation and inhibition of CYP 2A6 by 3-EA might shift the biological effects of other compounds activated by CYP 2A6 dynamically and kinetically while appearing in the biological systems simultaneously.

Specifically, 2,6-dimethylaniline (2,6-DMA), 3,5-dimethylaniline (3,5-DMA), and 3-ethylaniline (3EA) have been associated with an increased risk of human bladder cancer, independent of cigarette smoking, in a published case-control study. Understanding the metabolic activation of and DNA adduct formation by these chemicals is an important first step in elucidating their mechanisms of carcinogenesis and toxicity. Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism was profiled based on the hypothesis that N-hydroxylated metabolites are critical intermediates in the formation of DNA adducts. This work was extended to assess in vitro DNA adduct formation with the cell-free and cell-based assays. Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) was used for detection and semi-quantification of DNA adducts formed by 14C-labeled alkylanilines. Data indicated 3,5-DMA formed high levels of DNA adducts, suggesting that it is a potent carcinogen. Additionally, the levels of adducts exhibited inter-species variation. The effects of phase II metabolism on adduct formation were evaluated by comparing the results obtained from the two types of assays and by assessing the effects of phase II enzyme cofactors on the results of cell-free assay. (cont.) Results implied that sulfotransferase-mediated metabolism promotes cytotoxicity and mutagenicity of all three alkylanilines; however, glucuronidation may provide a protective mechanism. The effects of N-acetyltransferase-mediated metabolism on DNA adduct formation differed for the three alkylanilines; acetyl-CoA enhanced adduct formation by 3-EA and 2,6-DMA, but it reduced 3,5-DMA adduct formation. Human CYP2A6 universally catalyzed the oxidation of all structural isomers of dimethylanilines and ethylanilines, except 3-EA. In the present work, the hypothesis that 3-EA is a mechanism-based inactivator toward human P450 2A6 through covalent binding was examined by using AMS. 3-EA was characterized as a mechanism-based inactivator with a Ki of 34 !iM and a kinact of 0.055 min'. Results suggest that 3-EA might be involved in more than one biological effect in the human body through multiple pathways. Adduct formation and inhibition of CYP 2A6 by 3-EA might shift the biological effects of other compounds activated by CYP 2A6 dynamically and kinetically while appearing in the biological systems simultaneously.  Development of a collagen gel sandwich hepatocyte bioreactor for detecting hepatotoxicity of drugs and chemicals Understanding the hepatotoxicity of drugs and chemicals is essential for progress in academic research, medical science and in the development of new pharmaceuticals. Studying hepatotoxicity in vitro is a challenging task because hepatocytes, the metabolically active cells of the liver, are very difficult to maintain in culture. After just 24 hours, the cells detach from the plate and die, and even if they survive they usually do not express the metabolic functions which they have in vivo. It has been observed by others that culturing hepatocytes between two layers of collagen type I maintains in vivo-like morphology and also many drug metabolizing enzymes for weeks. In spite of the research examining drug metabolism in collagen sandwiches, there are very few studies evaluating this system for investigating hepatotoxicity. We cultured primary rat hepatocytes in the collagen sandwich configuration and our goal was to optimize this system for long-term studies and to examine toxicity of a variety of hepatotoxins. By measuring secretions of urea and albumin, and P4501A activity, we determined the optimal cell density to be 50,000 cells/cm2. We also evaluated the need for epidermal growth factor (EGF) in our cultures, by comparing urea and albumin secretions in cultures grown with and without EGF. The cultures without EGF had significantly less secretion of both urea and albumin just two days after plating. Therefore, we decided to include EGF in the medium. The toxins we examined were aflatoxin B1, acetaminophen, carbon tetrachloride, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), methyl methane sulfonate (MMS), cadmium, vinyl acetate and dimethylformamide (DMF). The cells were sensitive to aflatoxin B1, MMS, MNNG and cadmium. However, they were (cont.) immune to acetaminophen, carbon tetrachloride, vinyl acetate and DMF. Our Western Blots showed that CYP1A, 2B and 3A were maintained in the culture for a week, but CYP2E1 was lost gradually over time. CYP2E1 is also the primary metabolic enzyme for acetaminophen, carbon tetrachloride and DMF. Thus, it is possible that the lack of toxicity is due to the loss of the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of these compounds. Immunity to vinyl acetate suggests that carboxylesterase is also lost in culture, since this enzyme is the one which converts vinyl acetate to acetaldehyde. The metabolism of acetaminophen was also examined with liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Liquid chromatography showed that acetaminophen is metabolized primarily to the sulfate and glucuronide metabolites. In order to investigate whether the glutathione adduct was formed, we synthesized the adduct and determined its retention time with liquid chromatography and its fragmentation pattern with mass spectrometry. We isolated the fraction with the same retention time from the medium of acetaminophen-treated cells, and showed that it contains a peak with the same mass to charge ratio and fragmentation pattern as the glutathione adduct. We also examined the conditioned medium from the hepatocytes to investigate the secreted protein profile, which could potentially be used to find toxicity biomarkers. We were able to remove most of the albumin from the medium using an immuno-affinity column containing anti-albumin antibodies bound to protein A-agarose beads ...  Nitric oxide : cellular effects in vitro and in vivo The overall aim of this project was to investigate various cellular responses and toxic effects of nitric oxide, NO' and in vitro and in vivo. Nitric oxide gives rise to a complex spectrum of reactive species in oxygenated solution. The complexity of nitric oxide's chemistry is recapitulated in its effects on cells. Exposure to nitric oxide can result in changes on many different levels in cells ranging from protein and DNA damage, to damage to organelles and changes in gene expression, and even in cell death. Many models to study nitric oxide have been developed and will be used to study various responses to nitric oxide and related species. Nitric oxide and peroxynitrite-induced cellular damage has been and continues to be studied extensively using in vitro systems. Two systems have been used in this project, a delivery system for NO' as well as a cell line, which produces NO'. A SilasticÊ¾ membrane delivery system can be used to treat bacteria or cells to mimic in vivo exposure to nitric oxide. Mutations induced by nitric oxide in a set of Salmonella tester strains can be studied utilizing this delivery system. Activated RAW264.7 macrophage cells have been used as an in vitro model of nitric oxide production and cytotoxicity SJL/J mice bearing the transplantable lymphoma RcsX have been established as an in vivo model of nitric oxide production and toxicity. (cont.) This in vivo mouse model can be used to test results found in vitro. Specifically, the relationship between nitric oxide production and prostaglandin synthesis and glutathione homeostasis can be explored. Glutathione was found to be induced by nitric oxide production in this model, and this increase was due to increases in y-glutamylcysteinyl synthetase activity. This thesis studied both the regulatory and toxic effects of nitric oxide, both endogenously produced and from exogenous sources.  Regulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced apoptosis via posttranslational modifications in a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (cont.) phosphoproteomics technology, IMAC/LC/MS/MS, [approximately] 200 phosphosites were identified from HT-29 cells, some of which were detected only from insulin-treated cells. Our phosphoproteomics approach also enabled us to detect alteration of both known and unknown phosphorylation states of apoptosis-related proteins at two time points during early apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-α Apoptosis, a physiologically regulated cell death, plays critical roles in development and immune system by maintaining tissue homeostasis. The thesis project investigates regulations of apoptosis in a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, HT-29, exposed to diverse cellular stimuli, focusing on a specific protein as well as global level of proteins. The first part of the thesis demonstrated S-nitrosation of procaspase-9. S-nitrosation is a novel protein modification to regulate protein-protein interaction or protein activity. This modification has been implied to inactivate caspases. We could visualize S-nitrosation of an initiator caspase, procaspase-9, by enriching low-abundant procaspase-9 with immunoprecipitation and stabilizing S-nitroso-cysteine with biotin labeling. Nitric oxide synthase inhibitors and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) reduced the S-nitrosation level of procaspase-9, suggesting that S-nitrosation may be regulated by a nitric oxide synthase and denitrosation is likely a mechanism of apoptosis. The second part of the thesis is to examine survival effects of insulin on cells undergoing TNF-α-induced apoptosis. Insulin decreased the TNF-α-induced cleavage of key apoptotic mediators, caspases, and their substrates as well as apoptosis, in part, depending on phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K)/Akt pathway. One of protective mechanisms by insulin is likely to decrease the TNF-α-induced dissociation of a potent inhibitor of caspases, X-chromosome linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), from procaspase-9 via PI-3K/Akt pathway. Lack of phosphoproteomics data in HT-29 cells led the third part of the thesis to focus on investigating global level regulation of phosphoproteins during apoptosis.

        "text": "Development of an analytical method to quantify the oxidative deoxyribose damage product 3'-phosphoglycolaldehyde induced by radiation, iron and peroxynitrite Deoxyribose oxidation in DNA forms strongly electrophilic terminal blocking groups and abasic sites capable of stopping polymerases, forming DNA-protein crosslinks and nucleobase adducts. These threats to the genetic integrity of cells are caused by exogenous and endogenous oxidizing agents and may contribute to diseases such as cancer. To better understand the role of oxidative DNA damage in these diseases, it is necessary to quantify deoxyribose oxidation both in vitro and in vivo. Current methods lack the sensitivity required to measure low concentrations of deoxyribose oxidation products. The goals of the research findings reported here is to develop a sensitive method that can accurately and reproducibly quantify 3'-phosphoglycolaldehyde (PGA), one example of a deoxyribose oxidation product, and to apply the method to quantify PGA in vitro and in cells. Given the presence of reactive carbonyl groups in many deoxyribose oxidation products, the method should be widely applicable to other studies of oxidative ])NA damage. The analytical method exploits the reactive carbonyl moiety in PGA by derivatization as a stable oxime with pentafluorobenzylhydroxylamine, followed by solvent extraction and gas chromatography/negative chemical ionization/mass spectrometry. A stable isotopically-labeled [13C2]-PGA is synthesized and used as an internal standard. The method is linear in response over the range of 30 fmol to 300 pmol and precision is verified by analysis of a synthetic, PGA-containing oligodeoxynucleotide. The limit of detection in the presence of DNA is 30 fmol of PGA. The analytical method was then applied to the quantification of PGA in purified DNA and cultured cells treated with several oxidants. (cont.) y-Radiation forms PGA in a linear dose response both in vitro and in cells with a 1000-fold quenching effect in vivo. The total quantity of deoxyribose oxidation, determined by plasmid topoisomer analysis, allows the calculation of PGA formation per deoxyribose oxidation event. PGA is formed in 1% of deoxyribose oxidation events induced by y-radiation versus 7% for a-particles. PGA formation induced by Fe(II), Fe(II)/EDTA/H202, and peroxynitrite follows a nonlinear dose response best fitted to a second-order polynomial, in contrast to a linear response induced by Fe(II)/EDTA, with PGA formation representing 5% of deoxyribose oxidation events. Peroxynitrite-induced DNA damage is studied under conditions of both hydroxyl radical and carbonate radical formation. With increasing carbonate radical formation, PGA induction is suppressed which indicates that the carbonate radical is not capable of inducing PGA.

PGA formation induced by Fe(II), Fe(II)/EDTA/H202, and peroxynitrite follows a nonlinear dose response best fitted to a second-order polynomial, in contrast to a linear response induced by Fe(II)/EDTA, with PGA formation representing 5% of deoxyribose oxidation events. Peroxynitrite-induced DNA damage is studied under conditions of both hydroxyl radical and carbonate radical formation. With increasing carbonate radical formation, PGA induction is suppressed which indicates that the carbonate radical is not capable of inducing PGA.

        "text": "Nucleobase deamination as a biomarker of inflammatory processes (cont.) kinetic studies. Moderate increases ([approximately]30%) in nucleobase deamination products were observed in the SJL mice bearing the RcsX tumor, but the biological meaning of these increases awaits studies of DNA repair kinetics. dO was not detected in any study at levels above 5 per 10⁸ nt, leading to the prediction that it will not be present at significant levels in inflamed tissues in humans. As a complement to the LC-MS method for the quantification of nucleobase deamination products, enzymatic probes were also developed for oxidative and nitrosative DNA lesions. These probes would not only allow differential quantification of the two types of DNA damage, but would also allow the lesions to be mapped in any DNA sequence by coupling their activity with the technique of ligation-mediated PCR. As an extension of the biomarker study, the effects of ONOO⁻ dose and dose-rate on the DNA damage and mutations induced in the supF gene were investigated. The observations suggest that both the dose and dose-rate at which a genetic target is exposed to ONOO⁻ substantially influence the damage and mutational response and these parameters will need to be considered in assessing the potential effects of ONOO⁻ in vivo. Finally, an extended study using the analytical method developed in this thesis yielded results in E. coli consistent with a new paradigm: perturbations of nucleobase metabolism may lead to incorporation of the purine precursors hypoxanthine (I) and xanthine (X) into DNA. This can be regarded as another endogenous process causing DNA damage that may lead to human diseases such as cancer ... The objective of this thesis project was to develop nucleobase deamination products as biomarkers of inflammation and to study the role of these DNA lesions in the pathophysiology of inflammation-induced carcinogenesis. The basis of this research is the epidemiological evidence that chronic inflammation is associated with an increased risk of cancer, yet the link between the inflammatory process and the development of cancer has eluded definition. Biomarker development began with the establishment of a sensitive liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method to quantify four of the nucleobase deamination products: 2'-deoxyxanthosine (dX) and 2'-deoxyoxanosine (dO) from the deamination of dG; 2'-deoxyuridine (dU) from dC; and 2'-deoxyinosine (dl) from dA. The analytical method was then validated and tested with both in vitro and in vivo studies involving quantification of nucleobase deamination products in isolated plasmid DNA and human lymphoblastoid cells exposed to nitric oxide (NO)Ì at controlled physiological concentrations. Finally, the formation of nucleobase deamination products was analyzed in SJL/RcsX mice, an established mouse model of NO Ìover production. This set of studies revealed several important features of the nitrosative chemistry of NO Ìderivatives. The in vitro formation of dX, dl and dU was found to occur at nearly identical rates (k = 1.2 x 10⁵ M⁻¹s⁻¹). Low levels of nucleobase deamination products were formed in cells exposed to NO,Ì which suggests that cellular factors significantly influence the nitrosative chemistry. However, cellular glutathione (GSH) was found to play a smaller role than expected, considering the effects of GSH on steady-state concentrations of N₂0₃ in in vitro  Deoxyribose oxidation chemistry and endogenous DNA adducts Endogenous and exogenous oxidants react with cellular macromolecules to generate a variety of electrophiles that react with DNA produce cytotoxic and mutagenic adducts. One source of such electrophiles is deoxyribose in DNA itself. Oxidation of each position in deoxyribose generates a unique spectrum of products, many of which are highly reactive with DNA bases and lead to formation of adducts. The objective of this thesis was to clarify the chemistry of deoxyribose oxidation, with a focus on C4'-oxidation that gives rise to 3'- phosphoglycolate residues on the DNA backbone and releases base propenal or malondialdehyde, and to investigate the role of base propenals in the formation of an important endogenous DNA adduct, MI dG. First, an index of total deoxyribose oxidation was developed, one that provides a means to compare different oxidizing agents. This method exploits the reaction of aldehyde- and ketone-containing deoxyribose oxidation products with 14C-methoxyamine to form stable oxime derivatives that are quantified by accelerator mass spectrometry. Sensitive GC/MS methods were developed to quantify 3'-phosphoglycolate residues from deoxyribose C4'-oxidation and HPLC/post-column derivatization methods were developed to quantify the corresponding base propenal or malondialdehyde. (cont.) Combined with the quantification of total deoxyribose oxidation and the alternative product of C4'-oxidation, the 4'-ketoaldehyde abasic site, under the same conditions, these results offered direct insights into the partitioning of C4'-oxidation and the chemical mechanisms of deoxyribose oxidation in DNA. With a foundation of deoxyribose oxidation chemistry and analytical methods, the in vitro DNA oxidative damage induced by y-irradiation, Fe2+/EDTA, bleomycin and peroxynitrite was explored. The results revealed that malondialdehyde was neither sufficient nor necessary for the formation of MldG, while base propenal was effective in generating MldG. These observations were extended to an E. coli cell model in which the membrane content of polyunsaturated fatty acids was controlled. The results revealed that lipid peroxidation caused by y-irradiation was insufficient to produce MldG in cells and the level of MldG adducts was inversely correlated with the quantity of membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids when cells were treated with peroxynitrite. Finally, M1dG showed a moderate (-50%) increase in tissues from a mouse model of inflammation, while etheno-adducts induced by lipid peroxidation increased -3- fold. These results are again consistent with lipid peroxidation as a minor source of MldG.  Analysis of the structural changes caused by positive DNA supercoiling The procession of helix-tracking enzymes along a DNA molecule results in the formation of supercoils in the DNA, with positive supercoiling (overwinding) generated ahead of the enzyme, and negative supercoiling (underwinding) in its wake. While the structural and physiological consequences of negative supercoiling have been well studied, technical challenges have prevented extensive examination of positively supercoiled DNA. Studies suggest that at sufficiently high levels of overwinding, DNA relieves strain by adopting an elongated structure, where the bases are positioned extrahelically and the backbones occupy the center of the helix. This transition has only been identified, however, at a degree of supercoiling substantially higher than is generated physiologically. To examine the structural changes resulting from physiological levels of positive DNA supercoiling, I have developed a method for preparing highly purified positively supercoiled plasmid substrates. Based on a method previously developed in this laboratory, this allows for preparation of large quantities of very pure, highly positively supercoiled plasmid. It also expands on earlier methods by exploiting ionic strength to modulate the direction of supercoiling introduced, allowing preparation of either positively or negatively supercoiled substrates. (cont.) A combination of approaches has been used to elucidate changes to DNA structure that result from physiological levels of positive supercoiling. Enzymatic probes for regions of single-stranded character are not reactive with positively supercoiled plasmid, indicating that stably unpaired regions are not present. Additionally, the effect of supercoiling on the activity of restriction enzymes has been examined. With the enzymes tested, no substantial differences in cleavage rates were observed with either positively or negatively supercoiled substrates. To examine structural changes at a wider range of superhelical densities, design and preparation was undertaken on 2-aminopurine-containing DNA substrates for use in fluorescence studies with a magnetic micromanipulator. Technical limitations rendered these experiments infeasible with current instrumentation, but important insights were gained for future fluorescence-based A destabilizing effect on the base pairs, however, can be seen using Raman difference spectroscopy, suggesting a subtle shift toward the more extreme extrahelical state. (cont.) The Raman data suggest that structural adjustments due to positive supercoiling are small but significant, and in addition to the base-pairing effects, alterations are observed in phosphodiester torsion and the minor groove environment, as well as a slight shift in sugar pucker conformation to accommodate lengthening of the DNA backbone. These results point to subtle changes in DNA structure caused by biologically relevant levels of positive superhelical tension and positive supercoiling. All of the changes are consistent with the mechanical effects of helical overwinding and suggest a model in which base pair destabilization in overwound DNA could affect the search mechanisms used by DNA repair enzymes and the binding of other proteins to DNA.  Analysis of sequence-selective guanine oxidation by biological agents Oxidatively damaged DNA has been strongly associated with cancer, chronic degenerative diseases and aging. Guanine is the most frequently oxidized base in the DNA, and generation of a guanine radical cation (G'\") as an intermediate in the oxidation reaction leads to migration of a resulting cationic hole through the DNA n-stack until it is trapped at the lowest-energy sites. These sites reside at runs of guanines, such as 5'-GG-3' sequences, and are characterized by the lowest sequence-specific ionization potentials (IPs). The charge transfer mechanism suggests that hotspots of oxidative DNA damage induced by electron transfer reagents can be predicted based on the primary DNA sequence. However, preliminary data indicated that nitrosoperoxycarbonate (ONOOCO2\"), a mediator of chronic inflammation and a one-electron oxidant, displayed unusual guanine oxidation properties that were the focus of present work. As a first step in our study, we determined relative levels of guanine oxidation, induced by ONOOCO2 in all possible three-base sequence contexts (XGY) within double-stranded oligonucleotides. These levels were compared to the relative oxidation induced within the same guanines by photoactivated riboflavin, a one-electron reagent. We found that, in agreement with previous studies, photoactivated riboflavin was selective for guanines of lowest IPs located within 5'-GG-3' sequences. In contrast, ONOOCO2\" preferentially reacted with guanines located within 5'-GC-3' sequences characterized by the highest IPs. This demonstrated that that sequence-specific IP was not a determinant of guanine reactivity with ONOOCO2\". Sequence selectivities for both reagents were double-strand specific. Selectivity of ONOOCO2 for 5'-GC-3' sites was also observed in human genomic DNA after ligation-mediated PCR analysis. (cont.) Relative yields of different guanine lesions produced by both ONOOCO2\" and riboflavin varied 4- to 5-fold across all sequence contexts. To assess the role of solvent exposure in mediating guanine oxidation by ONOOCO2\", relative reactivities of mismatched guanines with ONOOCO2\" were measured. The majority of the mismatches displayed an increased reactivity with ONOOCO2 as compared to the fully matched G-C base-pairs. The extent of reactivity enhancement was sequence context-dependent, and the greatest levels of enhancement were observed for the conformationally flexible guanine- guanine (G-G) mismatches and for guanines located across from a synthetic abasic site. To test the hypothesis that the negative charge of an oxidant influences its reactivity with guanines in DNA, sequence-selective guanine oxidation by a negatively charged reagent, Fe+2-EDTA, was assessed and compared to guanine oxidation produced by a neutral oxidant, y-radiation. Because both of these agents cause high levels of deoxyribose oxidation, a general method to quantify sequence-specific nucleobase oxidation in the presence of direct strand breaks was developed. This method exploited activity of exonuclease III (Exo III), a 3' to 5' exonuclease, and utilized phosphorothioate-modified synthetic oligonucleotides that were resistant to Exo III activity. This method was employed to determine sequence-selective guanine oxidation by Fe+2-EDTA complex and y-radiation and to show that both agents produced identical guanine oxidation pattems and were equally reactive with all guanines, irrespective of their sequence-specific IPs or sequence context. (cont.) This showed that negative charge was not a determinant of Fe+2-EDTA-mediated guanine oxidation. Finally, the role of oxidant binding on nucleobase damage was assessed by studying sequence-selective oxidation produced by DNA-bound Fe+2 ions in the presence of H202. We found that the major oxidation targets were thymines located within 5'-TGG-3' motifs, demonstrating that while guanines were a required element for coordination of Fe+2 to DNA, they were not oxidized. Our results suggest that factors other than sequence-specific IPs can act as major determinants of sequence-selective guanine oxidation, and that current models of guanine oxidation and charge transfer in DNA cannot be used to adequately predict the location and identity of mutagenic lesions in the genome.  Nucleobase deamination as a biomarker of inflammatory processes (cont.) kinetic studies. Moderate increases ([approximately]30%) in nucleobase deamination products were observed in the SJL mice bearing the RcsX tumor, but the biological meaning of these increases awaits studies of DNA repair kinetics. dO was not detected in any study at levels above 5 per 10⁸ nt, leading to the prediction that it will not be present at significant levels in inflamed tissues in humans. As a complement to the LC-MS method for the quantification of nucleobase deamination products, enzymatic probes were also developed for oxidative and nitrosative DNA lesions. These probes would not only allow differential quantification of the two types of DNA damage, but would also allow the lesions to be mapped in any DNA sequence by coupling their activity with the technique of ligation-mediated PCR. As an extension of the biomarker study, the effects of ONOO⁻ dose and dose-rate on the DNA damage and mutations induced in the supF gene were investigated. The observations suggest that both the dose and dose-rate at which a genetic target is exposed to ONOO⁻ substantially influence the damage and mutational response and these parameters will need to be considered in assessing the potential effects of ONOO⁻ in vivo. Finally, an extended study using the analytical method developed in this thesis yielded results in E. coli consistent with a new paradigm: perturbations of nucleobase metabolism may lead to incorporation of the purine precursors hypoxanthine (I) and xanthine (X) into DNA. This can be regarded as another endogenous process causing DNA damage that may lead to human diseases such as cancer ... The objective of this thesis project was to develop nucleobase deamination products as biomarkers of inflammation and to study the role of these DNA lesions in the pathophysiology of inflammation-induced carcinogenesis. The basis of this research is the epidemiological evidence that chronic inflammation is associated with an increased risk of cancer, yet the link between the inflammatory process and the development of cancer has eluded definition. Biomarker development began with the establishment of a sensitive liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method to quantify four of the nucleobase deamination products: 2'-deoxyxanthosine (dX) and 2'-deoxyoxanosine (dO) from the deamination of dG; 2'-deoxyuridine (dU) from dC; and 2'-deoxyinosine (dl) from dA. The analytical method was then validated and tested with both in vitro and in vivo studies involving quantification of nucleobase deamination products in isolated plasmid DNA and human lymphoblastoid cells exposed to nitric oxide (NO)Ì at controlled physiological concentrations. Finally, the formation of nucleobase deamination products was analyzed in SJL/RcsX mice, an established mouse model of NO Ìover production. This set of studies revealed several important features of the nitrosative chemistry of NO Ìderivatives. The in vitro formation of dX, dl and dU was found to occur at nearly identical rates (k = 1.2 x 10⁵ M⁻¹s⁻¹). Low levels of nucleobase deamination products were formed in cells exposed to NO,Ì which suggests that cellular factors significantly influence the nitrosative chemistry. However, cellular glutathione (GSH) was found to play a smaller role than expected, considering the effects of GSH on steady-state concentrations of N₂0₃ in in vitro  Deoxyribose oxidation chemistry and endogenous DNA adducts Endogenous and exogenous oxidants react with cellular macromolecules to generate a variety of electrophiles that react with DNA produce cytotoxic and mutagenic adducts. One source of such electrophiles is deoxyribose in DNA itself. Oxidation of each position in deoxyribose generates a unique spectrum of products, many of which are highly reactive with DNA bases and lead to formation of adducts. The objective of this thesis was to clarify the chemistry of deoxyribose oxidation, with a focus on C4'-oxidation that gives rise to 3'- phosphoglycolate residues on the DNA backbone and releases base propenal or malondialdehyde, and to investigate the role of base propenals in the formation of an important endogenous DNA adduct, MI dG. First, an index of total deoxyribose oxidation was developed, one that provides a means to compare different oxidizing agents. This method exploits the reaction of aldehyde- and ketone-containing deoxyribose oxidation products with 14C-methoxyamine to form stable oxime derivatives that are quantified by accelerator mass spectrometry. Sensitive GC/MS methods were developed to quantify 3'-phosphoglycolate residues from deoxyribose C4'-oxidation and HPLC/post-column derivatization methods were developed to quantify the corresponding base propenal or malondialdehyde. (cont.) Combined with the quantification of total deoxyribose oxidation and the alternative product of C4'-oxidation, the 4'-ketoaldehyde abasic site, under the same conditions, these results offered direct insights into the partitioning of C4'-oxidation and the chemical mechanisms of deoxyribose oxidation in DNA. With a foundation of deoxyribose oxidation chemistry and analytical methods, the in vitro DNA oxidative damage induced by y-irradiation, Fe2+/EDTA, bleomycin and peroxynitrite was explored. The results revealed that malondialdehyde was neither sufficient nor necessary for the formation of MldG, while base propenal was effective in generating MldG. These observations were extended to an E. coli cell model in which the membrane content of polyunsaturated fatty acids was controlled. The results revealed that lipid peroxidation caused by y-irradiation was insufficient to produce MldG in cells and the level of MldG adducts was inversely correlated with the quantity of membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids when cells were treated with peroxynitrite. Finally, M1dG showed a moderate (-50%) increase in tissues from a mouse model of inflammation, while etheno-adducts induced by lipid peroxidation increased -3- fold. These results are again consistent with lipid peroxidation as a minor source of MldG.  Analysis of the structural changes caused by positive DNA supercoiling The procession of helix-tracking enzymes along a DNA molecule results in the formation of supercoils in the DNA, with positive supercoiling (overwinding) generated ahead of the enzyme, and negative supercoiling (underwinding) in its wake. While the structural and physiological consequences of negative supercoiling have been well studied, technical challenges have prevented extensive examination of positively supercoiled DNA. Studies suggest that at sufficiently high levels of overwinding, DNA relieves strain by adopting an elongated structure, where the bases are positioned extrahelically and the backbones occupy the center of the helix. This transition has only been identified, however, at a degree of supercoiling substantially higher than is generated physiologically. To examine the structural changes resulting from physiological levels of positive DNA supercoiling, I have developed a method for preparing highly purified positively supercoiled plasmid substrates. Based on a method previously developed in this laboratory, this allows for preparation of large quantities of very pure, highly positively supercoiled plasmid. It also expands on earlier methods by exploiting ionic strength to modulate the direction of supercoiling introduced, allowing preparation of either positively or negatively supercoiled substrates.

Moderate increases ([approximately]30%) in nucleobase deamination products were observed in the SJL mice bearing the RcsX tumor, but the biological meaning of these increases awaits studies of DNA repair kinetics. dO was not detected in any study at levels above 5 per 10⁸ nt, leading to the prediction that it will not be present at significant levels in inflamed tissues in humans. As a complement to the LC-MS method for the quantification of nucleobase deamination products, enzymatic probes were also developed for oxidative and nitrosative DNA lesions. These probes would not only allow differential quantification of the two types of DNA damage, but would also allow the lesions to be mapped in any DNA sequence by coupling their activity with the technique of ligation-mediated PCR. As an extension of the biomarker study, the effects of ONOO⁻ dose and dose-rate on the DNA damage and mutations induced in the supF gene were investigated. The observations suggest that both the dose and dose-rate at which a genetic target is exposed to ONOO⁻ substantially influence the damage and mutational response and these parameters will need to be considered in assessing the potential effects of ONOO⁻ in vivo. Finally, an extended study using the analytical method developed in this thesis yielded results in E. coli consistent with a new paradigm: perturbations of nucleobase metabolism may lead to incorporation of the purine precursors hypoxanthine (I) and xanthine (X) into DNA. This can be regarded as another endogenous process causing DNA damage that may lead to human diseases such as cancer ... The objective of this thesis project was to develop nucleobase deamination products as biomarkers of inflammation and to study the role of these DNA lesions in the pathophysiology of inflammation-induced carcinogenesis. The basis of this research is the epidemiological evidence that chronic inflammation is associated with an increased risk of cancer, yet the link between the inflammatory process and the development of cancer has eluded definition. Biomarker development began with the establishment of a sensitive liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method to quantify four of the nucleobase deamination products: 2'-deoxyxanthosine (dX) and 2'-deoxyoxanosine (dO) from the deamination of dG; 2'-deoxyuridine (dU) from dC; and 2'-deoxyinosine (dl) from dA. The analytical method was then validated and tested with both in vitro and in vivo studies involving quantification of nucleobase deamination products in isolated plasmid DNA and human lymphoblastoid cells exposed to nitric oxide (NO)Ì at controlled physiological concentrations. Finally, the formation of nucleobase deamination products was analyzed in SJL/RcsX mice, an established mouse model of NO Ìover production. This set of studies revealed several important features of the nitrosative chemistry of NO Ìderivatives. The in vitro formation of dX, dl and dU was found to occur at nearly identical rates (k = 1.2 x 10⁵ M⁻¹s⁻¹). Low levels of nucleobase deamination products were formed in cells exposed to NO,Ì which suggests that cellular factors significantly influence the nitrosative chemistry. However, cellular glutathione (GSH) was found to play a smaller role than expected, considering the effects of GSH on steady-state concentrations of N₂0₃ in in vitro  Deoxyribose oxidation chemistry and endogenous DNA adducts Endogenous and exogenous oxidants react with cellular macromolecules to generate a variety of electrophiles that react with DNA produce cytotoxic and mutagenic adducts. One source of such electrophiles is deoxyribose in DNA itself. Oxidation of each position in deoxyribose generates a unique spectrum of products, many of which are highly reactive with DNA bases and lead to formation of adducts. The objective of this thesis was to clarify the chemistry of deoxyribose oxidation, with a focus on C4'-oxidation that gives rise to 3'- phosphoglycolate residues on the DNA backbone and releases base propenal or malondialdehyde, and to investigate the role of base propenals in the formation of an important endogenous DNA adduct, MI dG. First, an index of total deoxyribose oxidation was developed, one that provides a means to compare different oxidizing agents. This method exploits the reaction of aldehyde- and ketone-containing deoxyribose oxidation products with 14C-methoxyamine to form stable oxime derivatives that are quantified by accelerator mass spectrometry. Sensitive GC/MS methods were developed to quantify 3'-phosphoglycolate residues from deoxyribose C4'-oxidation and HPLC/post-column derivatization methods were developed to quantify the corresponding base propenal or malondialdehyde. (cont.) Combined with the quantification of total deoxyribose oxidation and the alternative product of C4'-oxidation, the 4'-ketoaldehyde abasic site, under the same conditions, these results offered direct insights into the partitioning of C4'-oxidation and the chemical mechanisms of deoxyribose oxidation in DNA. With a foundation of deoxyribose oxidation chemistry and analytical methods, the in vitro DNA oxidative damage induced by y-irradiation, Fe2+/EDTA, bleomycin and peroxynitrite was explored. The results revealed that malondialdehyde was neither sufficient nor necessary for the formation of MldG, while base propenal was effective in generating MldG. These observations were extended to an E. coli cell model in which the membrane content of polyunsaturated fatty acids was controlled. The results revealed that lipid peroxidation caused by y-irradiation was insufficient to produce MldG in cells and the level of MldG adducts was inversely correlated with the quantity of membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids when cells were treated with peroxynitrite. Finally, M1dG showed a moderate (-50%) increase in tissues from a mouse model of inflammation, while etheno-adducts induced by lipid peroxidation increased -3- fold. These results are again consistent with lipid peroxidation as a minor source of MldG.  Analysis of the structural changes caused by positive DNA supercoiling The procession of helix-tracking enzymes along a DNA molecule results in the formation of supercoils in the DNA, with positive supercoiling (overwinding) generated ahead of the enzyme, and negative supercoiling (underwinding) in its wake. While the structural and physiological consequences of negative supercoiling have been well studied, technical challenges have prevented extensive examination of positively supercoiled DNA. Studies suggest that at sufficiently high levels of overwinding, DNA relieves strain by adopting an elongated structure, where the bases are positioned extrahelically and the backbones occupy the center of the helix. This transition has only been identified, however, at a degree of supercoiling substantially higher than is generated physiologically. To examine the structural changes resulting from physiological levels of positive DNA supercoiling, I have developed a method for preparing highly purified positively supercoiled plasmid substrates. Based on a method previously developed in this laboratory, this allows for preparation of large quantities of very pure, highly positively supercoiled plasmid. It also expands on earlier methods by exploiting ionic strength to modulate the direction of supercoiling introduced, allowing preparation of either positively or negatively supercoiled substrates. (cont.) A combination of approaches has been used to elucidate changes to DNA structure that result from physiological levels of positive supercoiling. Enzymatic probes for regions of single-stranded character are not reactive with positively supercoiled plasmid, indicating that stably unpaired regions are not present. Additionally, the effect of supercoiling on the activity of restriction enzymes has been examined. With the enzymes tested, no substantial differences in cleavage rates were observed with either positively or negatively supercoiled substrates. To examine structural changes at a wider range of superhelical densities, design and preparation was undertaken on 2-aminopurine-containing DNA substrates for use in fluorescence studies with a magnetic micromanipulator. Technical limitations rendered these experiments infeasible with current instrumentation, but important insights were gained for future fluorescence-based A destabilizing effect on the base pairs, however, can be seen using Raman difference spectroscopy, suggesting a subtle shift toward the more extreme extrahelical state. (cont.) The Raman data suggest that structural adjustments due to positive supercoiling are small but significant, and in addition to the base-pairing effects, alterations are observed in phosphodiester torsion and the minor groove environment, as well as a slight shift in sugar pucker conformation to accommodate lengthening of the DNA backbone. These results point to subtle changes in DNA structure caused by biologically relevant levels of positive superhelical tension and positive supercoiling. All of the changes are consistent with the mechanical effects of helical overwinding and suggest a model in which base pair destabilization in overwound DNA could affect the search mechanisms used by DNA repair enzymes and the binding of other proteins to DNA.

However, numerous studies have revealed important differences between TIMP family members in their ability to inhibit angiogenic processes in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo despite their universal ability to inhibit matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity. To address these differences, structure-function studies were conducted to identify and characterize the anti-angiogenic domains of TIMP-2, the endogenous MMP inhibitor that uniquely inhibits capillary endothelial cell (EC) proliferation and angiogenesis in vivo. Only the carboxy-terminal domain of TIMP-2 (T2C) and not the MMP-inhibitory N-terminal domain (T2N), inhibited capillary EC proliferation. Although both T2N and T2C inhibited embryonic angiogenesis, only T2C potently inhibited mitogen-stimulated angiogenesis. These findings demonstrate that TIMP-2 possesses two distinct types of anti-angiogenic activities which can be uncoupled from each other. The anti-proliferative activity of T2C was further mapped to the 24-amino acid peptide, Loop 6, which proved to be a potent inhibitor of both embryonic and nitogen-stimulated angiogenesis in vivo. Initial studies into the mechanism(s) by which Loop 6 inhibits angiogenesis revealed that the anti-proliferative effects of Loop 6 are due, at least in part, to the inhibition of cell cycle progression and not to the induction of apoptosis. This inhibition was associated with increased levels of cell cycle inhibitor p27. Although Loop 6 did not compete with bFGF for binding to its receptor, (cont.) five potential cell surface complexes were observed in crosslinking studies of capillary EC treated with ¹²⁵I-labeled T2C or Loop 6. Finally, given the high degree of homology between TIMP-2 and TIMP-4, we hypothesized that TIMP-4 might share anti-proliferative and MMP inhibition- independent anti-angiogenic activities with TIMP-2. Our results demonstrate that although TIMP-4 inhibits capillary EC migration, it does not inhibit capillary EC proliferation. Furthermore, TIMP-4 did not result in significant inhibition of embryonic angiogenesis in the CAM. These results suggest that TIMP-2 is unique among TIMP family members in its ability to inhibit angiogenesis via two distinct pathways.

        "text": "Biophysical characterization of high affinity engineered single chain Fv antibody fragments High affinity antibody binding interactions are important for both pharmaceutical and biotechnological uses. However, designing higher affinity interactions has remained difficult. Both high affinity interactions from nature and the results from directed evolution affinity maturation processes may yield clues about the important structural and energetic contributions to attain these tight associations. In this Thesis, we investigate affinity maturation of antibodies for very high affinity binding. Two single chain antigen-binding fragment (scFv) antibody systems that were engineered to obtain higher affinity interactions through directed evolution were probed using biophysical techniques to illuminate affinity modulation in proteins. First, anti-c-erbB-2 antibodies and their binding partner, the extracellular domain of the glycoprotein tumor antigen c-erbB-2, were examined. Thermodynamic studies were carried out on the originally identified human scFv and three higher affinity mutants. Although the first two steps included either entropic or enthalpic gains to affinity, the third improvement came from both types. This study demonstrates that a single energetic component is not generally responsible for the increased affinity within a given protein-protein affinity maturation pathway. Second, a family of anti-fluorescein antibodies and their binding to the small molecule fluorescein-biotin were explored. The femtomolar affinity matured anti-fluorescein antibody, 4M5.3, was compared to its wildtype high affinity precursor, 4-4-20. Affinity, thermodynamic, kinetic, and structural characterization of the binding identified 4M5.3 as one of the highest engineered affinity protein binding interactions known and (cont.) illuminated how subtle structural changes can lead to large consequences for the kinetics and free energy of binding. The affinity mechanisms were further studied by the creation of a series of partial mutants. Context dependent and independent mutational effects on binding affinity indicated the extent of complexity in higher affinity mechanisms attained through directed evolution affinity maturation processes. These studies emphasize the importance of a large number of residues working in concert to create a very high affinity binding molecule. Based on these results, both rational design and directed evolution studies will need to allow for mutations in a spatially broad range around the binding site and involve many biophysical contributions to the binding free energy to reach very high antigen binding affinities.  A directed evolution approach to engineering recombinant protein production in S. cerevisiae The continued success of protein therapeutics has put a strain on industry's ability to meet the large demand. Creating a more productive expression host for the manufacture of these proteins is a potential solution. Although heterologous proteins are frequently made in organisms as disparate as E. coli and bovines, the single-celled organism S. cerevisiae has emerged as a well-qualified candidate due to its approachable genetic and fermentation attributes as well as its ability to stably fold disulfide bonded and multi domain proteins. Because S. cerevisiae screens for enhanced protein secretion have traditionally utilized low-throughput and often plate-based methods, a high-throughput, liquid phase assay could offer a real advantage in secretory selection. In this thesis, yeast surface display is investigated as a potential proxy for heterologous protein secretion. Although ultimately unsuitable as a screening proxy, the surface display experiments did show a novel method of improving protein secretion by co-expressing a more stably folded protein with the protein of interest. In these studies the secretion of an scFv-Aga2p fusion was stimulated 1 0-fold by the concomitant surface expression of BPTI. (cont.) BPTI surface expression also stimulated the secretion of secreted scFv three-fold suggesting a niche for protein coexpression as well as secretion by way of Aga2p fusions. A new screening method was developed that involves the capture of secreted protein on the surface of the cell where it can be labeled and sorted by FACS. This new method was verified to achieve thirty-five fold enrichment per pass for a three-fold enhanced protein secretor making it easily suitable for screening. The new screening methodology, the Cell Surface Secretion Assay (CeSSA), was also modeled and verified with time course data that enabled optimization of sort parameters and predicted sort outcomes based on user-derived selection parameters. The CeSSA was used to screen a library of mutant yeast alpha mating factor leader sequences for improved secretion of the scFv 4m5.3. The improved leaders imparted up to a twenty-fold improvement in scFv secretion per cell and up to thirty-fold improvement after expression tuning. These engineered leader sequences also conferred improved secretion on other scFv's and proteins including whole IgG. Moreover, the leader sequence mutants give indications of where the important residues in secretory leaders lie and the aberrations in protein traffic that result in reduced secretion.  Biophysical characterization of high affinity engineered single chain Fv antibody fragments High affinity antibody binding interactions are important for both pharmaceutical and biotechnological uses. However, designing higher affinity interactions has remained difficult. Both high affinity interactions from nature and the results from directed evolution affinity maturation processes may yield clues about the important structural and energetic contributions to attain these tight associations. In this Thesis, we investigate affinity maturation of antibodies for very high affinity binding. Two single chain antigen-binding fragment (scFv) antibody systems that were engineered to obtain higher affinity interactions through directed evolution were probed using biophysical techniques to illuminate affinity modulation in proteins. First, anti-c-erbB-2 antibodies and their binding partner, the extracellular domain of the glycoprotein tumor antigen c-erbB-2, were examined. Thermodynamic studies were carried out on the originally identified human scFv and three higher affinity mutants. Although the first two steps included either entropic or enthalpic gains to affinity, the third improvement came from both types. This study demonstrates that a single energetic component is not generally responsible for the increased affinity within a given protein-protein affinity maturation pathway. Second, a family of anti-fluorescein antibodies and their binding to the small molecule fluorescein-biotin were explored. The femtomolar affinity matured anti-fluorescein antibody, 4M5.3, was compared to its wildtype high affinity precursor, 4-4-20. Affinity, thermodynamic, kinetic, and structural characterization of the binding identified 4M5.3 as one of the highest engineered affinity protein binding interactions known and (cont.) illuminated how subtle structural changes can lead to large consequences for the kinetics and free energy of binding. The affinity mechanisms were further studied by the creation of a series of partial mutants. Context dependent and independent mutational effects on binding affinity indicated the extent of complexity in higher affinity mechanisms attained through directed evolution affinity maturation processes. These studies emphasize the importance of a large number of residues working in concert to create a very high affinity binding molecule. Based on these results, both rational design and directed evolution studies will need to allow for mutations in a spatially broad range around the binding site and involve many biophysical contributions to the binding free energy to reach very high antigen binding affinities.  A directed evolution approach to engineering recombinant protein production in S. cerevisiae The continued success of protein therapeutics has put a strain on industry's ability to meet the large demand. Creating a more productive expression host for the manufacture of these proteins is a potential solution. Although heterologous proteins are frequently made in organisms as disparate as E. coli and bovines, the single-celled organism S. cerevisiae has emerged as a well-qualified candidate due to its approachable genetic and fermentation attributes as well as its ability to stably fold disulfide bonded and multi domain proteins. Because S. cerevisiae screens for enhanced protein secretion have traditionally utilized low-throughput and often plate-based methods, a high-throughput, liquid phase assay could offer a real advantage in secretory selection. In this thesis, yeast surface display is investigated as a potential proxy for heterologous protein secretion. Although ultimately unsuitable as a screening proxy, the surface display experiments did show a novel method of improving protein secretion by co-expressing a more stably folded protein with the protein of interest. In these studies the secretion of an scFv-Aga2p fusion was stimulated 1 0-fold by the concomitant surface expression of BPTI. (cont.) BPTI surface expression also stimulated the secretion of secreted scFv three-fold suggesting a niche for protein coexpression as well as secretion by way of Aga2p fusions.

        "text": "Intestinal cancer : linking infection, inflammation and neoplasia Cancer is a leading cause of death in the world. Much work has been done to study the role of inflammation in carcinogenesis. One hypothesis suggests that inflammation causes oxidative stress that induces damage to cellular targets, including DNA. The multistep model of cancer proposes that cancer is a genetic disease in which mutations are required in carcinogenesis. When this theory was championed, research focused on somatic mutations. The focus has broadened to include epigenetic mechanisms in changing gene expression. The association between chronic infection, chronic inflammation and increased cancer risk has been supported by epidemiologic studies. Data link chronic inflammation associated with infectious disease to increased cancer risk. Some examples of such infectious agents include hepatitis B virus, Schistosoma haemotobium, and Helicobacter pylori. One objective of this thesis was to investigate the role of inflammation in self-limiting infection. Additional objectives focus on evaluating a novel model of intestinal and extraintestinal cancer, and using immune regulating cells as treatment for intestinal cancer. For the first objective, a murine mutational analysis model was used to study infection with Citrobacter rodentium, an enteric bacterium that causes self-limiting hyperplasia and inflammation. Increased mutant frequency was observed in association with elevated levels of iNOS 13 days post infection. The second aim, to characterize a novel model of neoplasia, led to the discovery of basosquamous cancer in mice with intestinal tumors. Finally, Apc-[Min] mice, a model of intestinal neoplasia, were treated with T regulatory cells to investigate the role of these cells on tumor development. These (cont.) cells were previously observed to have an anti-inflammatory and therapeutic effect on an infection-driven model of colon cancer. It was shown that T regulatory cells led to a decrease in the number of adenomas. In conclusion, it has been shown that self-limiting infection can increase mutant frequency. In addition, a novel model of intestinal and basosquamous cancer has been characterized, and a promising therapy for intestinal cancer has been validated.  Development, characterization and transcriptional profiling of a mouse model of fatal infectious diarrhea and colitis Citrobacter rodentium is a naturally occurring murine bacterial pathogen which is used to model human diarrheagenic E. coli (EPEC and EHEC) infections in mice. C. rodentium causes colonic hyperplasia and a variable degree of colitis and mortality in the majority of inbred and outbred lines of mice. Differences in C. rodentium-induced disease are determined by the genetic background of the host. Here, C. rodentium infection in resistant outbred Swiss Webster (SW) mice was compared with infection in the cognate inbred FVB strain for the first time. In contrast to subclinical infection in SW mice, adult FVB mice developed overt disease with significant weight loss, severe colitis, and over 75% mortality. Fluid therapy intervention completely prevented mortality in FVB mice, and expression of pro-inflammatory and immunomodulatory genes in the colon was similar in both lines of mice, suggesting that mortality in C. rodentiuminfected FVB mice is due to hypovolemia resulting from severe dehydration. To identify host factors responsible for the development of mortality, gene expression in the distal colon of FVB and SW mice was investigated using a whole mouse genome Affymetrix array. (cont.) Transcripts represented by 1,547 probe sets (3.4%) were differentially expressed between FVB and SW mice prior to infection and at 4 and 9 days post-inoculation. Data analysis suggested that intestinal ion disturbances rather than immune-related processes are responsible for susceptibility in C. rodentium-infected FVB mice. Marked impairment in intestinal ion homeostasis predicted by microarray analysis was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and serum electrolyte measurements that showed hypochloremia and hyponatremia in susceptible FVB mice. C. rodentium infection was next characterized in additional inbred strains of Swiss origin. SWR and SJL mice developed minimal morbidity and no mortality in response to the pathogen, demonstrating resistance to disease. Furthermore, C3H mice developed severe diarrhea and gene expression changes comparable to those in infected FVB mice, suggesting common pathogenic mechanisms in susceptible strains. In conclusion, C. rodentium infection in FVB mice is a useful model for fatal infectious diarrhea. These studies contribute to our understanding of C. rodentium pathogenesis and identify possible candidates for susceptibility to fatal enteric bacterial infection.

C. rodentium causes colonic hyperplasia and a variable degree of colitis and mortality in the majority of inbred and outbred lines of mice. Differences in C. rodentium-induced disease are determined by the genetic background of the host. Here, C. rodentium infection in resistant outbred Swiss Webster (SW) mice was compared with infection in the cognate inbred FVB strain for the first time. In contrast to subclinical infection in SW mice, adult FVB mice developed overt disease with significant weight loss, severe colitis, and over 75% mortality. Fluid therapy intervention completely prevented mortality in FVB mice, and expression of pro-inflammatory and immunomodulatory genes in the colon was similar in both lines of mice, suggesting that mortality in C. rodentiuminfected FVB mice is due to hypovolemia resulting from severe dehydration. To identify host factors responsible for the development of mortality, gene expression in the distal colon of FVB and SW mice was investigated using a whole mouse genome Affymetrix array. (cont.) Transcripts represented by 1,547 probe sets (3.4%) were differentially expressed between FVB and SW mice prior to infection and at 4 and 9 days post-inoculation. Data analysis suggested that intestinal ion disturbances rather than immune-related processes are responsible for susceptibility in C. rodentium-infected FVB mice. Marked impairment in intestinal ion homeostasis predicted by microarray analysis was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and serum electrolyte measurements that showed hypochloremia and hyponatremia in susceptible FVB mice. C. rodentium infection was next characterized in additional inbred strains of Swiss origin. SWR and SJL mice developed minimal morbidity and no mortality in response to the pathogen, demonstrating resistance to disease. Furthermore, C3H mice developed severe diarrhea and gene expression changes comparable to those in infected FVB mice, suggesting common pathogenic mechanisms in susceptible strains. In conclusion, C. rodentium infection in FVB mice is a useful model for fatal infectious diarrhea. These studies contribute to our understanding of C. rodentium pathogenesis and identify possible candidates for susceptibility to fatal enteric bacterial infection.  Intestinal cancer : linking infection, inflammation and neoplasia Cancer is a leading cause of death in the world. Much work has been done to study the role of inflammation in carcinogenesis. One hypothesis suggests that inflammation causes oxidative stress that induces damage to cellular targets, including DNA. The multistep model of cancer proposes that cancer is a genetic disease in which mutations are required in carcinogenesis. When this theory was championed, research focused on somatic mutations. The focus has broadened to include epigenetic mechanisms in changing gene expression. The association between chronic infection, chronic inflammation and increased cancer risk has been supported by epidemiologic studies. Data link chronic inflammation associated with infectious disease to increased cancer risk. Some examples of such infectious agents include hepatitis B virus, Schistosoma haemotobium, and Helicobacter pylori. One objective of this thesis was to investigate the role of inflammation in self-limiting infection. Additional objectives focus on evaluating a novel model of intestinal and extraintestinal cancer, and using immune regulating cells as treatment for intestinal cancer. For the first objective, a murine mutational analysis model was used to study infection with Citrobacter rodentium, an enteric bacterium that causes self-limiting hyperplasia and inflammation. Increased mutant frequency was observed in association with elevated levels of iNOS 13 days post infection. The second aim, to characterize a novel model of neoplasia, led to the discovery of basosquamous cancer in mice with intestinal tumors. Finally, Apc-[Min] mice, a model of intestinal neoplasia, were treated with T regulatory cells to investigate the role of these cells on tumor development. These (cont.) cells were previously observed to have an anti-inflammatory and therapeutic effect on an infection-driven model of colon cancer. It was shown that T regulatory cells led to a decrease in the number of adenomas. In conclusion, it has been shown that self-limiting infection can increase mutant frequency. In addition, a novel model of intestinal and basosquamous cancer has been characterized, and a promising therapy for intestinal cancer has been validated.

        "text": "Probing nanomechanics of aggrecan and the aggrecan-rich pericellular matrix of chondrocytes in cartilage The mechanical properties of articular cartilage are associated with the extracellular matrix network of type II collagen and the proteoglycan, aggrecan, which in combination provide the tensile, shear, and compressive stiffness of the tissue. While the collagen network mainly provides resistance to tensile and shear deformation, aggrecan enmeshed within this network contributes significantly to the tissue's compressive and shear properties under equilibrium as well as dynamic loading conditions. Aggrecan has a \"bottle-brush\" structure that includes -100 negatively charged chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan (CS-GAG) chains attached covalently to a core protein. Electrostatic interactions between these GAGs contribute to the compressive and shear stiffness of the tissue. Variations in the structure of aggrecan and its GAG constituents are known to exist as a function of tissue age, disease, and species. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we directly visualized the nanometer scale structure of aggrecan deposited on a 2-D substrate, including the first high resolution imaging of individual GAG chains along the core protein. We also visualized and quantified the differences in structure between aggrecan obtained from fetal epiphyseal and mature nasal bovine cartilages. (cont.) A combination of AFM, biochemical, and polymer statistical methodologies was used to better understand the dependence of aggrecan structure and stiffness on the properties of its constituent GAG chains. The fetal epiphyseal aggrecan had a denser GAG brush region and longer GAG chains, which correlated with a higher effective persistence length of fetal core protein compared to that of mature nasal aggrecan. The effect of increasing the concentration of aggrecan on the substrate resulted in a decrease in molecular extension, suggesting a flexible protein core backbone, which allowed aggrecan to entangle and interact with neighboring molecules. AFM imaging of the conformation of aggrecan that had been deposited on substrates from solutions of varying ionic strength (IS), from DI water to the hysiological IS of 0.1 M NaCl, allowed for direct visualization of the collapse of the molecule on the substrate at the highest IS, due to charge shielding of the CS-GAGs by by Na+ counter-ions. Lastly, the nanomechanical properties of cartilage cells (chondrocytes) and their aggrecan-collagen-rich pericellular matrix (PCM) were probed via AFM nanoindentation using both a sharp nano tip and a larger micro-colloidal tip to better understand the deformation of cells in cartilage. (cont.) The properties of cells freshly isolated from cartilage tissue, devoid of PCM, were compared to that of cells isolated and then cultured for selected times in 3-D alginate gel to obtain cells surrounded by their newly developed PCM. Using Hertzian contact mechanics as well as finite element analyses, material properties were estimated from the AFM force-indentation curves measured with these cell preparations. We also studied the effects of culture conditions on the resulting PCM properties, comparing 10% fetal bovine serum vs. medium containing a combination of insulin growth factor-i (IGF-1) + osteogenic protein-i (OP-1). While both systems showed increases in matrix stiffness with time in culture between days 7 to 28, the IGF-1 + OP-1 combination resulted in a higher effective modulus for the cell-PCM composite. These AFM cell indentation studies were enabled by the use of microfabricated chips containing wells designed to immobilize the spherical chondrocytes during testing. Due to the nonconventional but known geometry of the microfabricated wells, finite element analysis was used to include the effects of the cell-well boundary conditions and tip geometries on the calculated cell-PCM material properties. (cont.) Taken together, these studies examining cartilage mechanics at the molecular and cellular levels give insight into the intricate roles that proteoglycans and collagen play in governing tissue-level mechanical properties.

        "text": "Molecular recognition of chlorine-doped polypyrrole The objective of this work is to functionalize an existing polymer such that it better mimics natural tissue for tissue growth and regeneration. Numerous other processes have tried and accomplished this by non-specific protein adsorption, covalent attachment, biomolecule entanglement, and synthesis of new polymers with the desired functionality. The focus of this work is to modify the polymer's binding capability to cells while not altering the bulk properties. Through the use of both phage display of peptide libraries and yeast surface display of scFv libraries the surface of chlorine-doped polypyrrole (PPyCl) has been modified to facilitate binding of neuronal phenotype cells. The selection of peptides using phage display found a surface specific recognition peptide (T59) that was made bivalent by altering the C-terminus with an integrin binding epitope. The bivalency of the modified T59 peptide was exploited to tether phenochromocytoma (PC12) cells to the surface of PPyCl. Furthermore the tethering of the cells to PPyCl through the peptide does not decrease the cells neuronal function and maintains the bulk conductive polymers characteristics. Using the peptide as a bivalent linker, the addition of other types of cells, drugs, growth factors, and enzymes could be incorporated for various biomedical applications. (cont.) An antibody (Y2) specific to PPyC1 was found using yeast surface display. This antibody was utilized to mediate cellular binding to PPyCl by expression of the antibody on the surface of PC12 cells. Complimenting the peptide studies of having an exterior bivalent linker the antibody recognition provides the means for any cell type to adhere to PPyCl, through expression of the antibody on the surface of the cell. This type of system could be used for various types of tissue growth supports.

        "text": "Improving the delivery and efficacy of molecular medicine via extracellular matrix modulation : insights from intravital microscopy The extracellular matrix of tumors is a major barrier to the delivery of molecular medicine. We used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching combined with intravital microscopy to quantitate the transport properties of the tumor interstitium. We found that the presence of fibrillar collagen correlated with hindered diffusion in vivo, and also in vitro, in collagen gels prepared to mimic tumor extracellular matrix. Modification of the tumor collagen matrix directly with purified bacterial collagenase, or indirectly with relaxin treatment, resulted in increased diffusion coefficients of macromolecules within tumors in vivo. In order to quantitate the changes in collagen content and structure induced by relaxin treatment, we adapted and further developed the imaging technique of intravital second harmonic generation microscopy. Using second harmonic generation imaging in combination with a fluorescently labeled gene therapeutic vector, we demonstrated that the spread of these viral vectors within tumors is limited by the fibrillar collagen in the extracellular matrix. Matrix modification via the introduction of bacterial collagenase along with the initial virus injection resulted in a significant improvement in the range of viral distribution within the tumor. (cont.) This resulted in an extended range of infection of cells within the tumor, and improved virus propagation, ultimately leading to enhanced therapeutic outcome. Thus, we show that fibrillar collagen is an important barrier to the distribution of molecular medicine within tumors, and that matrix modifying treatments can significantly enhance both vector distribution, as well as ultimately therapeutic response.

        "text": "Molecular substrate design for the selective adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of marrow connective tissue progenitors A multi-faceted approach was applied to the molecular design of substrates for the selective adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of connective tissue progenitors (CTPs) from human bone marrow aspirates. The basic premise of the thesis is that integrin-specific adhesion peptides, when presented in a biophysically appropriate spatial arrangement against an inert background, allow enrichment of CTPs in vitro. Comb copolymer comprising a methyl methacrylate backbone with 10-mer poly(oxyethylene) sidechains was selected as the vehicle to present small adhesion peptides at the surface. This polymer shows excellent performance in cell resistance studies and offers sufficient functionalizable sites to create high local densities of ligands. Methods for preparing comb copolymer substrates with peptides in [approx.] 300 nm² clusters with inter-ligand spacings closer than integrins were developed. This nanometer-scale clustered presentation was favorable to integrin binding. Cells were more spread on RGD peptide substrates with a higher degree of nanoscale clustering but of the same overall peptide surface density as comparable substrates with lower degree of peptide clustering. We evaluated adhesion peptides for their ability to support CFU formation of marrow-derived CTPs using colony forming unit (CFU) assay. (cont.) The results, analyzed with a statistical model implemented to capture characteristics of CFU assay, showed that while RGD substrates supported a moderate amount of alkaline phosphatase -positive CFU (CFU-AP) formation, the bone sialoprotein peptide FHRRII(A, and two [alpha]4 [beta]1 peptides demonstrated the best performance in promoting CFU-AP formation. Patient variability in CFU data could be partially explained by the variations in marrow aspirate cell integrin expression, particularly [alpha]5 and [alpha]v [beta]3. The high level of ECM protein association seen with aspirate cells, as revealed by immunoblotting, may inhibit cell adhesion and account for the fairly low CFU counts observed. Treatments of marrow aspirate with phosphate saline buffer (PBS) and RGD solution reduced a significant amount of protein association. A comprehensive study showed that patients' marrow aspirates were naturally partitioned into two groups of very different colony formation behavior and integrin and AP expressions but consistency was observed within each group. Upon treatment of marrow cells with divalent ion-free PBS, CFU-AP formation on RGD substrates drastically increased in one group of patients. The designs and assays developed in this thesis could be applied for the further understanding of marrow aspirates, such as their interaction with a high-affinity [alpha]5 [beta]1 peptide, and with that knowledge, further optimize the surface design of bone marrow grafts.  Microvessel structure formation in a 3D perfused co-culture of rat hepatocytes and liver endothelial cells Many liver physiological and pathophysiological behaviors are not adequately captured by current in vitro hepatocyte culture methods. A 3D perfused microreactor previously demonstrated superior hepatic functional maintenance than conventional 2D cultures, and was hypothesized to provide an environment favorable to endothelial cell maintenance and morphogenesis. This dissertation focuses on characterizing the 3D perfused co-culture of primary hepatocyte fraction with primary rat liver endothelial isolate. Scanning electron microscopy revealed significantly higher numbers of pore-like structures on the co-culture tissue surface resembling liver sinusoids compared to cultures containing only the hepatocytes fraction (mono-culture). EGFP-labeled endothelial cells proliferated moderately and organized into microvessel-like structures as observed by in situ multi-photon microscopy. By mixing female endothelial cells with male hepatocytes, the female cell population increased from initially -7% on day 1 to -12% on day 13, as determined by quantitative PCR on genomic DNA. The maintenance and morphogenesis of endothelial cells were not observed in parallel 2D collagen gel sandwich cultures. Immunohistochemistry further confirmed the presence of sinusoidal endothelia within the 3D co-culture tissue, as well as other non-parenchymal cells in both 3D mono-culture and co-culture. (cont.) Global transcriptional profiling confirmed the loss of endothelia in 2D culture as the comparison between mono-culture and co-culture showed substantial differential expression levels only in the 3D format. The majority of the genes expressed substantially higher in 3D co-culture than mono-culture was found to be endothelia-specific. A group of key liver metabolism genes, however, do not show significant expression differences between the 3D cultures. This study concludes that the 3D perfused microreactor maintains non-parenchymal cells better than the 2D format, and the retention of non-parenchymal cells in the primary hepatocyte fraction likely contributes to the maintenance of key hepatic function gene expression. Additional endothelial cells organize into microvessel-like structures in this environment, but exert little influence on the gene expression of most key liver transcription factors and metabolism enzymes. Therefore 3D cultures may eliminate the need of co-cultures for applications focusing on metabolic behaviors of hepatocytes, and 3D endothelial-hepatocyte co-cultures may prove useful in studies where proper endothelium structure is required, such as cancer metastasis.

Immunohistochemistry further confirmed the presence of sinusoidal endothelia within the 3D co-culture tissue, as well as other non-parenchymal cells in both 3D mono-culture and co-culture. (cont.) Global transcriptional profiling confirmed the loss of endothelia in 2D culture as the comparison between mono-culture and co-culture showed substantial differential expression levels only in the 3D format. The majority of the genes expressed substantially higher in 3D co-culture than mono-culture was found to be endothelia-specific. A group of key liver metabolism genes, however, do not show significant expression differences between the 3D cultures. This study concludes that the 3D perfused microreactor maintains non-parenchymal cells better than the 2D format, and the retention of non-parenchymal cells in the primary hepatocyte fraction likely contributes to the maintenance of key hepatic function gene expression. Additional endothelial cells organize into microvessel-like structures in this environment, but exert little influence on the gene expression of most key liver transcription factors and metabolism enzymes. Therefore 3D cultures may eliminate the need of co-cultures for applications focusing on metabolic behaviors of hepatocytes, and 3D endothelial-hepatocyte co-cultures may prove useful in studies where proper endothelium structure is required, such as cancer metastasis.  Molecular substrate design for the selective adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of marrow connective tissue progenitors A multi-faceted approach was applied to the molecular design of substrates for the selective adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of connective tissue progenitors (CTPs) from human bone marrow aspirates. The basic premise of the thesis is that integrin-specific adhesion peptides, when presented in a biophysically appropriate spatial arrangement against an inert background, allow enrichment of CTPs in vitro. Comb copolymer comprising a methyl methacrylate backbone with 10-mer poly(oxyethylene) sidechains was selected as the vehicle to present small adhesion peptides at the surface. This polymer shows excellent performance in cell resistance studies and offers sufficient functionalizable sites to create high local densities of ligands. Methods for preparing comb copolymer substrates with peptides in [approx.] 300 nm² clusters with inter-ligand spacings closer than integrins were developed. This nanometer-scale clustered presentation was favorable to integrin binding. Cells were more spread on RGD peptide substrates with a higher degree of nanoscale clustering but of the same overall peptide surface density as comparable substrates with lower degree of peptide clustering. We evaluated adhesion peptides for their ability to support CFU formation of marrow-derived CTPs using colony forming unit (CFU) assay. (cont.) The results, analyzed with a statistical model implemented to capture characteristics of CFU assay, showed that while RGD substrates supported a moderate amount of alkaline phosphatase -positive CFU (CFU-AP) formation, the bone sialoprotein peptide FHRRII(A, and two [alpha]4 [beta]1 peptides demonstrated the best performance in promoting CFU-AP formation. Patient variability in CFU data could be partially explained by the variations in marrow aspirate cell integrin expression, particularly [alpha]5 and [alpha]v [beta]3. The high level of ECM protein association seen with aspirate cells, as revealed by immunoblotting, may inhibit cell adhesion and account for the fairly low CFU counts observed. Treatments of marrow aspirate with phosphate saline buffer (PBS) and RGD solution reduced a significant amount of protein association. A comprehensive study showed that patients' marrow aspirates were naturally partitioned into two groups of very different colony formation behavior and integrin and AP expressions but consistency was observed within each group. Upon treatment of marrow cells with divalent ion-free PBS, CFU-AP formation on RGD substrates drastically increased in one group of patients. The designs and assays developed in this thesis could be applied for the further understanding of marrow aspirates, such as their interaction with a high-affinity [alpha]5 [beta]1 peptide, and with that knowledge, further optimize the surface design of bone marrow grafts.  Microvessel structure formation in a 3D perfused co-culture of rat hepatocytes and liver endothelial cells Many liver physiological and pathophysiological behaviors are not adequately captured by current in vitro hepatocyte culture methods. A 3D perfused microreactor previously demonstrated superior hepatic functional maintenance than conventional 2D cultures, and was hypothesized to provide an environment favorable to endothelial cell maintenance and morphogenesis. This dissertation focuses on characterizing the 3D perfused co-culture of primary hepatocyte fraction with primary rat liver endothelial isolate. Scanning electron microscopy revealed significantly higher numbers of pore-like structures on the co-culture tissue surface resembling liver sinusoids compared to cultures containing only the hepatocytes fraction (mono-culture). EGFP-labeled endothelial cells proliferated moderately and organized into microvessel-like structures as observed by in situ multi-photon microscopy. By mixing female endothelial cells with male hepatocytes, the female cell population increased from initially -7% on day 1 to -12% on day 13, as determined by quantitative PCR on genomic DNA. The maintenance and morphogenesis of endothelial cells were not observed in parallel 2D collagen gel sandwich cultures.

        "text": "Mechanical injury and inflammatory cytokines affect cartilage integrity and tissue homeostasis : a mass spectrometric analysis of proteins with relevance to arthritis Osteoarthritis is characterized by synovial joint degeneration, and its cardinal pathological feature is degeneration and loss of the articular cartilage joint surface. While the aetiology of osteoarthritis is unknown, risk factors include gender, age, obesity, and prior joint injury. Joint injuries, including tears of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and meniscus, increase the risk for the development of OA and involve both mechanical damage to cartilage, meniscus and synovial tissues, and tissue degradation associated with cytokine-induced inflammation. While the role of inflammatory cytokines in OA is still controversial, their role in rheumatoid arthritis is evidenced by the successful use of anti-TNF-ca and anti-IL-1 therapies to abrogate disease symptoms and progression. In vitro, both IL-13 and TNF-ca promote chondrocyte-mediated matrix degradation and inhibit cartilage matrix synthesis, while mechanical damage causes cell death, matrix damage, and decreased cell biosynthesis. Understanding the similarities and differences in cartilage responses to inflammatory cytokines and mechanical injury is important in understanding the catabolic-anabolic shifts that typify OA progression. Therefore, the objectives of this thesis were (1) to identify the role of TNF-a and IL-1 induced nitric oxide (NO) as a mediator of cartilage tissue damage; (cont.) (2) to characterize and compare the regulation by IL- 1 P, TNF-cc, and mechanical injury of secreted factors, matrix degradation, and mechanisms of chondrocyte cell death using an SDS-PAGE-LC/MS/MS protein profiling approach; and (3) to further quantify the effects of IL-1 3, TNF-ca and injury using an isobaric isotope labeling (iTRAQ) based 2D-LC/MS/MS approach. Together these studies were designed to provide better understanding of matrix degradation, cell death, immune response, and evidence of cell-mediated repair processes. NO is produced by chondrocytes in response to inflammatory cytokines TNF-a, IL-1 3 and IL-17, and can mediate cellular and extracellular events through cGMP signaling, protein modifications (e.g., S-nitrosation or tyrosine nitration), altered transcript stability, and altered sugar and lipid chemistry. Cartilage was treated with IL-13 or TNF-ca left untreated in the presence or absence of the NO synthase inhibitor, L-N-methylarginine (L-NMA), and changes in gene expression and matrix breakdown were measured. We found that L-NMA treatment partially inhibited TNF-a-induced, aggrecanase-mediated aggrecan degradation as indicated by a decrease in sGAG loss to the medium and by an increase in the generation of aggrecanase-specific aggrecan fragments. (cont.) No change was observed upon addition of L-NMA to IL- 1P treated explants, but addition of L-NMA to combined IL-1 3 and TNF-a treated explants increased sGAG loss, suggesting that the effects of NO may be contextual. We hypothesized that this might be due to differences in aggrecanase expression (ADAMTS4 vs. ADAMTS5) or post-translational modification, but no aggrecanase was consistently identified in the samples. No difference in MMP expression or activation was noted following addition of L-NMA, and no change in NO chemistry between IL-1 3 and TNF-a treatment was evident by nitrate and nitrite production. Gene expression analysis was conducted on a battery of 32 genes, including matrix proteins, inflammatory mediators, proteases, cytokines and growth factors, and housekeeping proteins. While IL-113 and TNF-a both increased the expression of proteases and inflammatory mediators, addition of L-NMA did not significantly affect expression of the genes tested. We concluded that the effects of TNF-a and IL-1 p-induced NO production may depend on differences in cellular responses to each of these cytokines and possibly to differences in signaling or aggrecanase expression. (cont.) In the second study, newborn bovine calf cartilage explants were treated with 10 ng/ml IL-1 p, 100 ng/ml TNF-a, radially-unconfined injurious compression (strain: 50%; strain rate 1000/o/sec), or no treatment, and cultured for five days. Pooled medium was subjected to SDS-PAGE-LC/MS/MS, and data were analyzed by Spectrum Mill proteomics software, focusing on protein identification, differences between treatments and matrix protein proteolysis. Over 250 proteins were identified among the four protein groups including CD 109, platelet derived growth factor like protein, and scrapie responsive protein, which have not been previously identified in cartilage. IL-13 and TNF-a caused an increase in YKL39, YKL40, complement factor B, MMP-3, ECM-1, haptoglobin, serum amyloid A3, and clusterin. Injurious compression caused the release of intracellular proteins including GRP58, GRP78, alpha 4 actinin, pyruvate kinase, and vimentin, suggesting a loss of membrane integrity in a population of chondrocytes. Data on actin release within the first 24 hours suggested that this loss of membrane integrity occurred by mechanical cell disruption. Injurious compression also caused proteolysis of collagen type VI subunits, collagen type II, and COMP. Thrombospondin 1 fragments were seen in all treatment groups, and aggrecan proteolysis was predominant with cytokine treatment. (cont.) Cartilage explants subjected to injurious compression released intracellular proteins and showed enhanced degradation of matrix proteins, while explants subjected to IL- 13 or TNF-ct released proteins involved in innate immunity and stress response. In the third study, cartilage explants were subjected to injurious compression, TNF-a (100 ng/ml) or IL-13 (10 ng/ml), or no treatment, cultured in equal volumes of medium, and the medium was collected, pooled and the proteins deglycosylated by treatment with chondroitinase ABC. The proteins were subjected to trypsinization, and the peptides were labeled with one of four iTRAQ labels each containing a unique signature ion. The labeled peptides were subjected to nano-2D-LC/MS/MS on a QStar, quadrupole time of flight instrument. The study was done in analytical replicate on a pooled sample of greater than 70 explants from a total of 6-12 different animals. Data were analyzed by ProQuant to obtain a ProGroup peptide report containing identified spectra, which were combined to achieve a peptide, and then a protein level output of mean ratios, standard deviations of those ratios, and significance based on either Wilcoxan sign rank or Student's t-test both corrected for multiple comparisons. (cont.) Because of our interest in catabolic and anabolic shifts, a targeted data analysis approach was taken in addition to a systems level PCA and K-means clustering approach. By focusing on particular protein domains, we identified a decrease in the synthesis of most fibrillar collagen subunits (p<0.05), and an increase in the release of the aggrecan G2 and G3 domains with IL-13 and TNF-ta treatment (p<0.05). We also noted a significant increase in MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-13 in at least one condition and, in most cases, all conditions compared to the untreated sample. Increases in proteins involved in innate immunity and immune cell recruitment were noted with IL-1 [3 and TNF-a treatment, while an increase in intracellular protein release was seen most dramatically with mechanical compression injury. Since anabolic effects are often driven by the insulin-like growth factor family and the TGF-[3 superfamily, we specifically identified members of these pathways to understand which factors may mediate early repair processes. (cont.) At the systems level, 2 principal components were sufficient to describe 97% of the covariance in the data. IL- 1 and TNF-a caused a similar response in proteins identified; in contrast, a 'Y'-shaped distribution was observed upon projection of proteins based on their response injury vs. cytokine treatment. K-means clustering revealed six main clusters to further characterize the biology of mechanical injury versus cytokine effects on cartilage.

No change was observed upon addition of L-NMA to IL- 1P treated explants, but addition of L-NMA to combined IL-1 3 and TNF-a treated explants increased sGAG loss, suggesting that the effects of NO may be contextual. We hypothesized that this might be due to differences in aggrecanase expression (ADAMTS4 vs. ADAMTS5) or post-translational modification, but no aggrecanase was consistently identified in the samples. No difference in MMP expression or activation was noted following addition of L-NMA, and no change in NO chemistry between IL-1 3 and TNF-a treatment was evident by nitrate and nitrite production. Gene expression analysis was conducted on a battery of 32 genes, including matrix proteins, inflammatory mediators, proteases, cytokines and growth factors, and housekeeping proteins. While IL-113 and TNF-a both increased the expression of proteases and inflammatory mediators, addition of L-NMA did not significantly affect expression of the genes tested. We concluded that the effects of TNF-a and IL-1 p-induced NO production may depend on differences in cellular responses to each of these cytokines and possibly to differences in signaling or aggrecanase expression. (cont.) In the second study, newborn bovine calf cartilage explants were treated with 10 ng/ml IL-1 p, 100 ng/ml TNF-a, radially-unconfined injurious compression (strain: 50%; strain rate 1000/o/sec), or no treatment, and cultured for five days. Pooled medium was subjected to SDS-PAGE-LC/MS/MS, and data were analyzed by Spectrum Mill proteomics software, focusing on protein identification, differences between treatments and matrix protein proteolysis. Over 250 proteins were identified among the four protein groups including CD 109, platelet derived growth factor like protein, and scrapie responsive protein, which have not been previously identified in cartilage. IL-13 and TNF-a caused an increase in YKL39, YKL40, complement factor B, MMP-3, ECM-1, haptoglobin, serum amyloid A3, and clusterin. Injurious compression caused the release of intracellular proteins including GRP58, GRP78, alpha 4 actinin, pyruvate kinase, and vimentin, suggesting a loss of membrane integrity in a population of chondrocytes. Data on actin release within the first 24 hours suggested that this loss of membrane integrity occurred by mechanical cell disruption. Injurious compression also caused proteolysis of collagen type VI subunits, collagen type II, and COMP. Thrombospondin 1 fragments were seen in all treatment groups, and aggrecan proteolysis was predominant with cytokine treatment. (cont.) Cartilage explants subjected to injurious compression released intracellular proteins and showed enhanced degradation of matrix proteins, while explants subjected to IL- 13 or TNF-ct released proteins involved in innate immunity and stress response. In the third study, cartilage explants were subjected to injurious compression, TNF-a (100 ng/ml) or IL-13 (10 ng/ml), or no treatment, cultured in equal volumes of medium, and the medium was collected, pooled and the proteins deglycosylated by treatment with chondroitinase ABC. The proteins were subjected to trypsinization, and the peptides were labeled with one of four iTRAQ labels each containing a unique signature ion. The labeled peptides were subjected to nano-2D-LC/MS/MS on a QStar, quadrupole time of flight instrument. The study was done in analytical replicate on a pooled sample of greater than 70 explants from a total of 6-12 different animals. Data were analyzed by ProQuant to obtain a ProGroup peptide report containing identified spectra, which were combined to achieve a peptide, and then a protein level output of mean ratios, standard deviations of those ratios, and significance based on either Wilcoxan sign rank or Student's t-test both corrected for multiple comparisons. (cont.) Because of our interest in catabolic and anabolic shifts, a targeted data analysis approach was taken in addition to a systems level PCA and K-means clustering approach. By focusing on particular protein domains, we identified a decrease in the synthesis of most fibrillar collagen subunits (p<0.05), and an increase in the release of the aggrecan G2 and G3 domains with IL-13 and TNF-ta treatment (p<0.05). We also noted a significant increase in MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-13 in at least one condition and, in most cases, all conditions compared to the untreated sample. Increases in proteins involved in innate immunity and immune cell recruitment were noted with IL-1 [3 and TNF-a treatment, while an increase in intracellular protein release was seen most dramatically with mechanical compression injury. Since anabolic effects are often driven by the insulin-like growth factor family and the TGF-[3 superfamily, we specifically identified members of these pathways to understand which factors may mediate early repair processes. (cont.) At the systems level, 2 principal components were sufficient to describe 97% of the covariance in the data. IL- 1 and TNF-a caused a similar response in proteins identified; in contrast, a 'Y'-shaped distribution was observed upon projection of proteins based on their response injury vs. cytokine treatment. K-means clustering revealed six main clusters to further characterize the biology of mechanical injury versus cytokine effects on cartilage.  Mechanical injury and inflammatory cytokines affect cartilage integrity and tissue homeostasis : a mass spectrometric analysis of proteins with relevance to arthritis Osteoarthritis is characterized by synovial joint degeneration, and its cardinal pathological feature is degeneration and loss of the articular cartilage joint surface. While the aetiology of osteoarthritis is unknown, risk factors include gender, age, obesity, and prior joint injury. Joint injuries, including tears of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and meniscus, increase the risk for the development of OA and involve both mechanical damage to cartilage, meniscus and synovial tissues, and tissue degradation associated with cytokine-induced inflammation. While the role of inflammatory cytokines in OA is still controversial, their role in rheumatoid arthritis is evidenced by the successful use of anti-TNF-ca and anti-IL-1 therapies to abrogate disease symptoms and progression. In vitro, both IL-13 and TNF-ca promote chondrocyte-mediated matrix degradation and inhibit cartilage matrix synthesis, while mechanical damage causes cell death, matrix damage, and decreased cell biosynthesis. Understanding the similarities and differences in cartilage responses to inflammatory cytokines and mechanical injury is important in understanding the catabolic-anabolic shifts that typify OA progression. Therefore, the objectives of this thesis were (1) to identify the role of TNF-a and IL-1 induced nitric oxide (NO) as a mediator of cartilage tissue damage; (cont.) (2) to characterize and compare the regulation by IL- 1 P, TNF-cc, and mechanical injury of secreted factors, matrix degradation, and mechanisms of chondrocyte cell death using an SDS-PAGE-LC/MS/MS protein profiling approach; and (3) to further quantify the effects of IL-1 3, TNF-ca and injury using an isobaric isotope labeling (iTRAQ) based 2D-LC/MS/MS approach. Together these studies were designed to provide better understanding of matrix degradation, cell death, immune response, and evidence of cell-mediated repair processes. NO is produced by chondrocytes in response to inflammatory cytokines TNF-a, IL-1 3 and IL-17, and can mediate cellular and extracellular events through cGMP signaling, protein modifications (e.g., S-nitrosation or tyrosine nitration), altered transcript stability, and altered sugar and lipid chemistry. Cartilage was treated with IL-13 or TNF-ca left untreated in the presence or absence of the NO synthase inhibitor, L-N-methylarginine (L-NMA), and changes in gene expression and matrix breakdown were measured. We found that L-NMA treatment partially inhibited TNF-a-induced, aggrecanase-mediated aggrecan degradation as indicated by a decrease in sGAG loss to the medium and by an increase in the generation of aggrecanase-specific aggrecan fragments.

        "text": "Synthesis of a hydrogel-based vaccine to mimic dendritic cell responses to pathogens Live or attenuated pathogens are the basis of many successful vaccines due in part to the orchestrated response of dendritic cells (DCs) triggered by these immunizations, which includes (1) DC and DC precursor attraction to the immunization site, (2) efficient antigen delivery to class I and class II MHC loading pathways coincident with maturation of DCs, and (3) emigration to draining lymph nodes for T cell activation. We have developed a model immunization system designed to allow these steps in the DC life cycle to be controlled in the context of a subunit vaccine. The system is comprised of microspheres encapsulating chemokines and hydrogel nanoparticles; each nanoparticle contains antigen and DC maturation signals (e.g., TLR ligands). The nanoparticles remain sequestered within the carrier microspheres but the chemokine is released at a controllable rate, creating a local chemoattractant gradient centered on each microsphere. DCs are attracted to individual microspheres where nanoparticles are concentrated; attracted DCs extract nanoparticles from the carrier microspheres, and receive maturation signals coincident with the delivery of antigen into both class I and class II MHC processing pathways. (cont.) In addition, the nanoparticles may be labeled to allow subsequent tracking of particle-carrying DCs in vivo. These components allow the attraction (or if desired, emigration) of dendritic cells and their precursors to be selectively modulated at an immunization site, and the activation signals received by these cells when they encounter antigen to be tailored. In vitro experiments indicate that chemokine-releasing microspheres effectively attract DCs and monocytes over significant distances, and that the gel nanoparticles efficiently trigger DC maturation and lead to both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation in vitro and in vivo. This system provides both a platform for rational immunotherapy as well as a powerful set of tools by which the function of dendritic cells can be manipulated and dissected to improve our understanding of how DC trafficking and functional state impacts immune responses.

However, the design principles governing the construction and operation of these networks remain mostly unknown. To discover design principles in these networks, we investigated and developed a set of computational tools described below. First, we looked into the application of optimization techniques to explore network topology, parameterization, or both, and to evaluate relative fitness of networks operational strategies. In particular, we studied the ability of an enzymatic cycle to produce dynamic properties such as responsiveness and transient noise filtering. We discovered that non-linearity of the enzymatic cycle allows more effective filtering of transient noise. Furthermore, we found that networks with multiple activation steps, despite being less responsive, are better in filtering transient noise. Second, we explored a method to construct compact models of signal transduction networks based on a protein-domain network representation. This method generates models whose number of species, in the worst case, scales quadratically to the number of protein-domain sites and modification states, a tremendous saving over the combinatorial scaling in the more standard mass-action model was estimated to consist of more that 10⁷ species and was too large to simulate; however, a simplified model consists of only 132 state variables and produced intuitive behavior. The resulting models were utilized to study the roles of a scaffold protein and of a shared binding domain to pathway functions.

This method generates models whose number of species, in the worst case, scales quadratically to the number of protein-domain sites and modification states, a tremendous saving over the combinatorial scaling in the more standard mass-action model was estimated to consist of more that 10⁷ species and was too large to simulate; however, a simplified model consists of only 132 state variables and produced intuitive behavior. The resulting models were utilized to study the roles of a scaffold protein and of a shared binding domain to pathway functions. Simulation and optimization tools to study design principles of biological networks Recent studies have developed preliminary wiring diagrams for a number of important biological networks. However, the design principles governing the construction and operation of these networks remain mostly unknown. To discover design principles in these networks, we investigated and developed a set of computational tools described below. First, we looked into the application of optimization techniques to explore network topology, parameterization, or both, and to evaluate relative fitness of networks operational strategies. In particular, we studied the ability of an enzymatic cycle to produce dynamic properties such as responsiveness and transient noise filtering. We discovered that non-linearity of the enzymatic cycle allows more effective filtering of transient noise.

The myocyte experimental model provides a higher level of physiological relevance than molecular or myofibril studies while avoiding problems inherent to multicellular preparations including heterogeneity of cell types and diffusion limited extracellular spaces. Millions of primary myocytes that remain viable for four to six hours can be readily isolated from animal models. However, the mechanical properties of only a few physically loaded myocytes can be explored in this time period using current, bulky and expensive instrumentation. In this thesis, a prototype instrument is described that is modular and inexpensive and could form the basis of an array of devices for probing the mechanical properties of single mammnalian myocytes in parallel. This would greatly increase the throughput of scientific experimentation and could be applied as a high content screening instrument in the pharmaceutical industry providing information at the level of a critical cellular phenotype, myocyte mechanical properties, for drug development and toxicology studies.

The mathematical, mechanical and electrical characteristics of the novel force sensor and actuator system, Ho control implementation and data processing methodology are discussed.

        "text": "Quantitative imaging of living cells by deep ultraviolet microscopy Developments in light microscopy over the past three centuries have opened new windows into cell structure and function, yet many questions remain unanswered by current imaging approaches. Deep ultraviolet microscopy received attention in the 1950s as a way to generate image contrast from the strong absorbance of proteins and nucleic acids at wavelengths shorter than 300 nm. However, the lethal effects of these wavelengths limited their usefulness in studies of cell function, separating the contributions of protein and nucleic acid proved difficult, and scattering artifacts were a significant concern. We have used short exposures of deep-ultraviolet light synchronized with an ultraviolet-sensitive camera to observe mitosis and motility in living cells without causing necrosis, and quantified absorbance at 280 nm and 260 nm together with tryptophan native fluorescence in order to calculate maps of nucleic acid mass, protein mass, and quantum yield in unlabeled cells. We have also developed a method using images acquired at 320nm and 340nm, and an equation for Mie scattering, to determine a scattering correction factor for each pixel at 260nm and 280nm. These developments overcome the three main obstacles to previous deep UV microscopy efforts, creating a new approach to imaging unlabeled living cells that acquires quantitative information about protein and nucleic acid as a function of position and time.

This thesis studies the fundamental limits of on-chip integrated microfluidic sensors. More specifically, it focuses on detection methods involving surface interaction in channels with thicknesses on the order of a few microns or less. Through mass transfer analysis, we demonstrate that, for thin enough channels, sample detection is limited by the convective transport of analytes, and neither by diffusion nor reaction. The results provided extend the validity of transport models to include transport in the absence of mass transfer boundary layer. All existing analytic solutions to the Graetz problem are described and compiled. The analysis, complemented by finite element simulations, successfully predicts experimental observations made for on-chip immunoassays in micron-thick fluidic channels. Subsequently, our study of on chip detection systems is carried on with emphasis on resonating cantilever sensors. In order to interpret the output signal from these devices, we develop a dynamic cantilever model to link spatially and temporally dependent mass adsorption with resonance frequency change. (cont.) The mass adsorption is then directly related to the sensors' operating conditions via the mass transfer models previously developed. We then develop a 2D finite-element model capable of predicting the devices response and of extracting bimolecular rate constants. Finally, since hydraulic resistance severely increases as channels get shallower, we provide a structural analysis of polymer-based microsystems. Through scaling and numerical simulations we demonstrate the effect of channel deformation on the flow conditions inside the device and vice versa. Finally, channel deformation is experimentally quantified using optical methods and compared with the models developed. Throughout this thesis, the approach to physical modeling has been to use mathematical and numerical analysis as predictive tools in the design of integrated lab-on-a-chip systems.

Frequently, progress in this area is made by altering an existing small molecule or protein for new function. This thesis presents methods for the analysis and design of rationally and evolutionarily designed molecules and focuses on applying these methods to make protein and small molecule changes more strategically. First, electrostatic analysis of a series of small molecule neuraminidase inhibitors was used to demonstrate that charge optimization improves the electrostatic component of the binding free energy, despite changes in binding mode and discrete chemical constraints. Additionally, chemical changes suggested by charge optimization frequently corresponded to tighter-binding inhibitors, indicating that this technique would be useful for the design of future inhibitors. Second, computational sequence and structure analysis were used to study the PDZ3-CRIPT binding interaction and a method for sequence analysis was developed to locate residues important for binding specificity. Third, computational analysis of the horseradish peroxidase active site suggested five positions as candidates for mutation, and further studies of new mutant enzymes let to ideas for the improvement of computational enzyme design procedures. Finally, both computational protein design techniques and a model of the evolutionary process were used to study the efficiency of evolution as a tool for creating new proteins in the laboratory. We identified sequences that serve as better evolutionary starting points that others and provide a general framework for considering the impact of protein structure on the allowed sequence space and therefore on the challenges that each protein presents to evolutionary protein engineering procedures.

However differentiated sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs), marked by SE-1 expression are difficult to maintain in culture while stellate cells easily activate and over-proliferate. We hypothesized that recreating a liver tissue system that captured in vivo like paracrine influences would foster survival of these cells, and predicted that stimuli resulting from flow and oxygen gradients close to physiological conditions would preserve the delicate balance between the cell types. Spheroids containing hepatoctyes with incorporated non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) were seeded into capillary bed sized channels in polycarbonate scaffolds, housed in a three-dimensional perfused system, and maintained for two weeks. Micro-flow rates of different media through the formed tissue units in scaffolds were controlled using pneumatic pumps and microfluidics. Staining and confocal imaging of endpoint tissue showed that lower flow rates closer to physiological regimes allowed the survival of SE-1+ SECs, regardless of exogenously added growth factors in the medium. Higher flow rates, exogenous growth factors, and scaffold contact were associated with activation of stellate cells (alpha-smooth muscle actin staining). Since oxygen measurements in the system coupled low flow rates with hypoxic tissue outlet concentrations, we parsed out these variables by repeating flow experiments in low oxygen environments. Retention of SE-i staining cells even in higher flow rates demonstrated that hypoxic conditions in the tissue could play a role in aiding their survival by overcoming negative effects brought about by high flow. The relationship of stellate cells with flow rate was unaffected by oxygen concentrations. To explore if the negative effects of high flow on SE-i expression were mediated by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-[beta]), we added a TGF-[beta] inhibitor SB-431542 in our cultures, and found that it greatly enhanced the presence of SE-1 staining SECs at high flow rates. In conclusion we successfully created a three-dimensional flow controlled hepatic culture system that allows balanced survival of hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells, making it useful as a potential model for studies such as cancer metastasis that require interactions between tumor cells and heterotypic host tissue.

        "text": "Simulation, models, and refactoring of bacteriophage T7 gene expression Our understanding of why biological systems are designed in a particular way would benefit from biophysically-realistic models that can make accurate predictions on the time-evolution of molecular events given arbitrary arrangements of genetic components. This thesis is focused on constructing such models for gene expression during bacteriophage T7 infection. T7 gene expression is a particularly well suited model system because knowledge of how the phage functions is thought to be relatively complete. My work focuses on two questions in particular. First, can we address deficiencies in past simulations and measurements of bacteriophage T7 to improve models of gene expression? Second, can we design and build refactored surrogates of T7 that are easier to understand and model? To address deficiencies in past simulations and measurements, I developed a new single-molecule, base-pair-resolved gene expression simulator named Tabasco that can faithfully represent mechanisms thought to govern phage gene expression. I used Tabasco to construct a model of T7 gene expression that encodes our mechanistic understanding. The model displayed significant discrepancies from new system-wide measurements of absolute T7 mRNA levels during infection. (cont.) I fit transcript-specific degradation rates to match the measured RNA levels and as a result corrected discrepancies in protein synthesis rates that confounded previous models. I also developed and used a fitting procedure to the data that let us evaluate assumptions related to promoter strengths, mRNA degradation, and polymerase interactions. To construct surrogates of T7 that are easier to understand and model, I began the process of refactoring the T7 genome to construct an organism that is a more direct representation of the models that we build. In other words, instead of making our models evermore detailed to explain wild-type T7, we started to construct new phage that are more direct representations of our models. The goal of our original design, T7. 1, was to physically define, separate, and enable unique manipulation of primary genetic elements. To test our initial design, we replaced the left 11,515 bp of the wild-type genome with 12,179 bp of engineered DNA. The resulting chimeric genome encodes a viable bacteriophage that appears to maintain key features of the original while being simpler to model and easier to manipulate.

        "text": "The impact of age, exposure and genetics on homologous recombination at the engineered repeat sequence in mice Mitotic homologous recombination is a critical pathway for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and broken replication forks. Although homologous recombination is generally error-free, recombination between misaligned sequences can lead to deleterious sequence rearrangements, and conditions that stimulate homologous recombination are associated with an increased risk of cancer. To study homologous recombination in vivo, we used Fluorescent Yellow Direct Repeat (FYDR) mice in which a homologous recombination event at a transgene yields a fluorescent cell. To study homologous recombination using FYDR mice, we developed one- and two-photon in situ imaging techniques that reveal both the frequency and the sizes of isolated recombinant cell clusters within intact pancreatic tissue. We then applied these tools to analyze the effects of cancer risk factors such as exposure, genetic predisposition and age on homologous recombination in vivo. To determine the effect of exposure to exogenous carcinogens on homologous recombination, FYDR mice were treated with two different chemotherapeutic agents, cisplatin and mitomycin-C. (cont.) Results show that exposure to these DNA damaging agents causes an induction of recombinant pancreatic cells in vivo, indicating that homologous recombination is an active repair pathway in adult pancreatic cells and that exposure to certain carcinogens stimulates recombinational repair. As a first step towards exploring the effect of genetic predisposition to genomic instability on homologous recombination in vivo, FYDR mice were crossed with mice carrying a defect in p53, a critical tumor suppressor that is mutated in almost 50% of all human tumors. Although loss of p53 is known to promote genomic instability, results show that p53 status does not significantly affect the spontaneous recombinant cell frequency in the pancreas in vivo or the rate of homologous recombination in cultured fibroblasts in vitro. Age is a risk factor for many types of cancers. Here we examined the effect of age on homologous recombination in two tissues of FYDR mice, pancreas and skin. In the pancreas, a dramatic accumulation of recombinant cells is seen with age, resulting from both de novo recombination events and clonal expansion of recombinant cells. In contrast, the skin shows no increase in recombinant cell frequency with age. (cont.) In vitro studies using primary fibroblasts indicate that the ability to undergo homologous recombination in response to endogenous and exogenous DNA damage does not significantly change with age, suggesting that these skin cells are able to undergo de novo homologous recombination events in aged mice. Thus, we propose that tissue-specific differences in the accumulation of recombinant cells with age result from differences in the ability of these cells to persist and clonally expand within the tissue. To further characterize the FYDR mice as a tool for studying homologous recombination, we exploited positive control FYDR-Recombined mice in which all cells carry the full-length coding sequence for enhanced yellow fluorescent protein. Studies show that expression of the FYDR transgene varies among mice, among tissues, and even among cells within a tissue. However, the variation in FYDR expression does not significantly change with age or exposure to exogenous carcinogens. Furthermore, positive control mice reveal that several tissues, in addition to the pancreas and skin, may be amenable for studying homologous recombination in the FYDR mice. (cont.) Thus, our studies demonstrate that FYDR mice combined with in situ imaging technology provide powerful tools to study the effects of cancer risk factors on homologous recombination in vivo. Ultimately, by applying these techniques to study additional cancer risk factors, we may better understand the relationship between DNA damage, homologous recombination and cancer.  The impact of age, exposure and genetics on homologous recombination at the engineered repeat sequence in mice Mitotic homologous recombination is a critical pathway for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and broken replication forks. Although homologous recombination is generally error-free, recombination between misaligned sequences can lead to deleterious sequence rearrangements, and conditions that stimulate homologous recombination are associated with an increased risk of cancer. To study homologous recombination in vivo, we used Fluorescent Yellow Direct Repeat (FYDR) mice in which a homologous recombination event at a transgene yields a fluorescent cell. To study homologous recombination using FYDR mice, we developed one- and two-photon in situ imaging techniques that reveal both the frequency and the sizes of isolated recombinant cell clusters within intact pancreatic tissue. We then applied these tools to analyze the effects of cancer risk factors such as exposure, genetic predisposition and age on homologous recombination in vivo. To determine the effect of exposure to exogenous carcinogens on homologous recombination, FYDR mice were treated with two different chemotherapeutic agents, cisplatin and mitomycin-C. (cont.) Results show that exposure to these DNA damaging agents causes an induction of recombinant pancreatic cells in vivo, indicating that homologous recombination is an active repair pathway in adult pancreatic cells and that exposure to certain carcinogens stimulates recombinational repair. As a first step towards exploring the effect of genetic predisposition to genomic instability on homologous recombination in vivo, FYDR mice were crossed with mice carrying a defect in p53, a critical tumor suppressor that is mutated in almost 50% of all human tumors. Although loss of p53 is known to promote genomic instability, results show that p53 status does not significantly affect the spontaneous recombinant cell frequency in the pancreas in vivo or the rate of homologous recombination in cultured fibroblasts in vitro. Age is a risk factor for many types of cancers. Here we examined the effect of age on homologous recombination in two tissues of FYDR mice, pancreas and skin. In the pancreas, a dramatic accumulation of recombinant cells is seen with age, resulting from both de novo recombination events and clonal expansion of recombinant cells. In contrast, the skin shows no increase in recombinant cell frequency with age. (cont.) In vitro studies using primary fibroblasts indicate that the ability to undergo homologous recombination in response to endogenous and exogenous DNA damage does not significantly change with age, suggesting that these skin cells are able to undergo de novo homologous recombination events in aged mice.

        "text": "Quantitative analysis of non-viral gene therapy in primary liver culture systems Gene therapy has the potential to cure thousands of diseases caused by genetic abnormalities, provide novel combination therapies for cancers and viral infections, and offer a new and effective platform for next generation vaccines. However, after more than three decades of research and development efforts, clinical success has yet to be realized. Successful delivery of DNA is a crucial first step in attaining safe and effective gene therapeutics. While vectors based upon recombinant viruses have shown high delivery and transfection efficiencies, they may also pose certain health risks to patients, can be difficult to target to cell or tissue types of interest, and present difficulties for large-scale manufacturing. Non-viral vectors look to offer a safer alternative and can be engineered to more effectively treat a specific cell type, tissue, or pathology, but these vectors are still plagued with low transfection levels and cannot provide adequate and sustained levels of gene expression. Continued efforts focus on producing next generation non-viral vectors that safely deliver therapeutic transgenes with the efficiency of their viral counterparts. Many barriers exist in the successful trafficking of these non-viral complexes to the nucleus. (cont.) Current evaluations of non-viral gene delivery treatments in more clinical settings often focus on a single barrier at a time, and as a result, may not lead to an overall improvement in gene delivery. Concurrently, more quantitative or systematic in vitro experiments may not correlate well with in vivo data. Our combined approach of quantitative vector trafficking and expression experiments coupled with computational simulation of vector specific mathematical models that describe every step of the gene delivery process has shown that a systems level approach can glean insight into the most rate-limiting steps for a given vector and generate hypotheses for future vector development and improvement. These studies have been extended to primary liver cultures, coupled with device development to attain a more clinically relevant model system and more spatial resolution to study intracellular vector trafficking and localization. A larger perfused 3-D liver bioreactor has been built that allows for long-term culture of primary hepatocytes that more closely mimic hepatic phenotype than in conventional 2-D cultures and for multiplexed quantitative measurement that is not possible in animal models. (cont.) A newly constructed density gradient electrophoresis device can separate vesicular organelles and track vector dynamics throughout the cell. These systems have provided more comprehensive data sets which show that vectors behave differently in different culture systems and that different vectors show unique cell trafficking dynamics.

This process, termed mechanotransduction, was investigated using computational and theoretical approaches, as well as comparisons with experiments. As a first step, a three-dimensional viscoelastic finite element model was developed to simulate cell micromanipulation by magnetocytometry. The model provided a robust tool for analysis of detailed strain/stress fields induced within a single cell or cell monolayer produced by forcing one tethered microbead. On the assumption of structural homogeneity, stress and strain patterns were highly localized, suggesting that the effects of magnetocytometry are confined to a region extending less than 10tm from the bead. Modification of the model to represent experimental focal adhesion attachments supported a non-uniform force transmission to basal surface focal adhesion sites. Proteins in identified zones of high stresses in the cell are candidate mechanosensors and their molecular response to force was hence investigated, A generic model of protein extension under external forcing was created inspired by Kramers theory for reaction rate kinetics in liquids. (cont.) The protein was hypothesized to have two distinct conformational states: a relaxed state, Ci, preferred in the absence of external force, and an extended state, C2, favored under force application. Appearance and persistence of C2 was assumed to lead to transduction of the mechanical signal into a chemical one. While the level of applied force and the energy difference between states largely determined equilibrium, the dominant influence on the extension time was the height of the transition state. Force-induced distortions in the energy landscape were also shown to have a significant influence on extension time, however, exhibiting a weaker force dependence than exponential. Finally, the link between membrane receptors and the extracellular matrix -- or the bead in magnetocytometry experiments -- was investigated as a primary path for force transduction to the cell interior. To shed light on the role of bonds formed by membrane receptors on measurements of cellular rheology, we modeled the process by which a forced, cell-tethered microbead translates and rotates as influenced by the stochastic formation and. rupture of adhesion bonds. We show that this process is crucial in the inference of cell mechanical properties from microbead experiments.

        "text": "Mapping the actin and actin binding proteins interactions : from micromechanics to single molecule force spectroscopy Mechanical forces play an important role in cell morphology, orientation, migration, adhesion and can even induce apoptosis. The eukaryotic cell is equipped with a dynamic frame, known as the cytoskeleton, that provides the cell's structural integrity in order to sustain and react to such forces. Therefore, understanding the mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton is an important step towards building models describing cell behavior. Filamentous actin (F-actin), as one of the major constituents of the cytoskeleton, has been the target of extensive in vitro studies to determine its mechanical properties in bulk. However, there is still a lack in the understanding of how the molecular interactions between F-actin and the proteins that arrange these filaments into networks regulate the dynamic properties of the cytoskeleton Here we present a novel, single molecule assay to test the rupture force of a complex formed by an actin binding protein (ABP) linking two actin filaments. We readily demonstrate the adaptability of this assay by testing it with two different ABPs: filamin, a crosslinker, and a-actinin, a bundler. We measured rupture forces of 28-73 pN and 30-56 pN for filamin/actin and a-actinin/actin respectively, suggesting that the former is a slightly stronger interaction. Moreover, since no ABP unfolding events were observed at our force levels, our results suggest that ABP unbinding is a more relevant mechanism than unfolding for the temporal regulation of the mechanical properties of the actin cytoskeleton. In addition, we explore the micro-scale properties of F-actin networks reconstituted in vitro. (cont.) Using imaging and microrheology techniques we characterized the effects of filament length and degree of crosslinking on the structural arrangement and mechanical properties of F-actin networks. We found that the mechanical properties of these networks are length-scale dependent. Also, when probed with active methods, the F-actin networks exhibited strain hardening followed by a gradual softening at forces -30 pN, in good agreement with the single molecule rupture force of 28-73 pN. Thus, with the combination of single molecule and network studies, we can expand the knowledge-base on the regulation and control of the cellular machinery starting from the molecular building blocks.

        "text": "Flow-induced mechanotransduction in cell-cell junctions of endothelial cells Endothelial cells show an unexpected behavior shortly after the onset of laminar flow: their crawling speed decreases ~40% within the first 30 min, but only in a confluent monolayer of endothelial cells, not in subconfluent cultures, where cell-cell interactions are limited. This led us to study early shear effects on cell-cell adherens junctions. We found a 30±6% increase in the number of VE-cadherin molecules in the junctions. The strength of interactions of endothelial cells with surfaces coated with recombinant VE-cadherin protein also increased after laminar flow. These observations suggest that endothelial cell junction proteins respond to flow onset. The process of clustering may induce diffusion of monomers to the junction area, resulting in an overall increase in VE-cadherins in the junctions. To directly confirm the role of adherens junctions in the decrease in cell crawling speed, we used siRNA-knockdown technique to produce cells lacking VE-cadherin. These cells showed no decline in crawling speed under flow. Our interpretation is consistent with previous data on junction disassembly 8 hr after flow onset. The speed of endothelial cell crawling returns to the original level by that time, and junctional disassembly may explain that phenomenon. In order to understand better the change in VE-cadherin distribution under flow and during junction formation and remodelling, we developed a mathematical model of VE-cadherin redistribution in endothelial cells. This model allowed us to develop a quantitative framework for analysis of VE-cadherin redistribution and estimate the amount of protein in the junctions and on the apical surface. In addition to that, the model explains rapid junction disassembly in the leukocyte transmigration and junction formation in subconfluent cells. (cont.) These studies show that intercellular adhesion molecules are important in the force transmission and shear stress response. Their role, however, is not limited to flow mechanotransduction. Intercellular force transmission has an important application - organ development and, specifically, angiogenesis. We studied the role of VE-cadherin in vessel development in HUVECs and showed that VE-cadherin-null cells do not form vessels in the in vitro assay.

Work done by the stalk in contraction is shown to be dependent on its fractional change in length. This energy dependence arises from the basic underlying mechanism, and a major goal of this thesis was to characterize that mechanism by imaging the underlying structure.

Citrobacter rodentium is a well-characterized model of infectious colitis with particular usefulness for modeling human diarrheal disease or inflammatory bowel disease. Infection with Helicobacter hepaticus is subclinical and persistent in C57BL/6 mice, but causes disease in susceptible strains and immunodeficient mice. To test the hypothesis that subclinical persistent infection modulates the host response to diarrheal disease a polymicrobial mouse model utilizing H. hepaticus and C. rodentium was developed and characterized. Concurrent infection has been shown to modulate disease outcome through several mechanisms including: cross-reactivity between viral antigens; shifting T cell response from Th1 to Th2 by helminth infection; and induction of regulatory T cells that suppress host response. In this new model of polymicrobial infection, a new paradigm in which persistent infection prolonged the course of acute colitis associated with a deviation from Thl-biased disease to Th17 was observed. (cont.) In addition, Foxp3+naturally-occurring regulatory T cells (nTre,) were markedly increased during active colitis. The accumulation of nTreg was sustained when mice were persistently infected with H. hepaticus, indicating on-going active colitis. Although persistent infection was able to modulate host response, protective immunity to a subsequent C. rodentium infection was not compromised. Persistent infection also modulated host response to soluble antigen by preventing induction of oral tolerance to single bolus, but not to continuous, high-dose antigen feeding. Using H. hepaticus infection of C57BL/6 mice, models to investigate the immunomodulatory potential of persistent infection on immunogenic responses of protective immunity to enteric infection, host response to polymicrobial enteric infection, as well as tolerogenic responses to soluble antigen were developed. These models establish baselines for further investigation into the influences of persistent infection on host immune responses.

Persistent infection also modulated host response to soluble antigen by preventing induction of oral tolerance to single bolus, but not to continuous, high-dose antigen feeding. Using H. hepaticus infection of C57BL/6 mice, models to investigate the immunomodulatory potential of persistent infection on immunogenic responses of protective immunity to enteric infection, host response to polymicrobial enteric infection, as well as tolerogenic responses to soluble antigen were developed. These models establish baselines for further investigation into the influences of persistent infection on host immune responses.  ",

        "text": "Design principles of mammalian signaling networks : emergent properties at modular and global scales This thesis utilizes modeling approaches rooted in statistical physics and physical chemistry to investigate several aspects of cellular signal transduction at both the modular and global levels. Design principles of biological networks and cell signaling processes pertinent to disease progression emerge from these studies. It is my hope that knowledge of these principles may provide new mechanistic insights and conceptual frameworks for thinking about therapeutic intervention into diseases such as cancer and diabetes that arise from aberrant signaling. Areas of interest have emphasized the role of scaffold proteins in protein kinase cascades, modeling relevant biophysical processes related to T cell activation, design principles of signal transduction focusing on multisite phosphorylation, quantifying the notion of signal duration and the time scale dependence of signal detection, and entropy based models of network architecture inferred from proteomics data. These problems are detailed below. The assembly of multiple signaling proteins into a complex by a scaffold protein guides many cellular decisions. Despite recent advances, the overarching principles that govern scaffold function are not well understood. We carried out a computational study using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to understand how spatial localization of kinases on a scaffold may regulate signaling under different physiological condition. Our studies identify regulatory properties of scaffold proteins that allow them to both amplify and attenuate incoming signals in different biological contexts. In a further, supplementary study, simulations also indicate that a major effect that scaffolds exert on the dynamics of cell signaling is to control how the activation of protein kinases is distributed over time[2]. (cont.) Scaffolds can influence the timing of kinase activation by allowing for kinases to become activated over a broad range of times, thus allowing for signaling across a broad spectrum of time scales. T cells orchestrate the adaptive immune response and are central players in maintenance of functioning immune system. Recent studies have reported that T cells can integrate signals between interrupted encounters with Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs) in such a way that the process of signal integration exhibits a form of memory. We carried out a computational study using a simple mathematical model of T cell activation to investigate the ramifications of interrupted T cell-APC contacts on signal integration. We considered several mechanisms of how signal integration at these time scales may be achieved. In another study, we investigated the role of spatially localizing signaling components of the T cell signaling pathway into a structure known as the immunological synapse. We constructed a minimal mathematical model that offers a mechanism for how antigen quality can regulate signaling dynamics in the immunological synapse These studies involving the analysis of signaling dynamics led us to investigate how differences in signal duration might be detected. Signal duration (e.g. the time scales over which an active signaling intermediate persists) is a key regulator of biological decisions in myriad contexts such as cell growth, proliferation, and developmental lineage commitments. Accompanying differences in signal duration are numerous downstream biological processes that require multiple steps of biochemical regulation. We present an analysis that investigates how simple biochemical motifs that involve multiple stages of regulation can be constructed to differentially process signals that persist at different time scales[3]. (cont.) Topological features of these networks that allow for different frequency dependent signal processing properties are identified. One role of multisite phosphorylation in cell signaling is also investigated. The utilization of multiple phosphorylation sites in regulating a biological response is ubiquitous in cell signaling. If each site contributes an additional, equivalent binding site, then one consequence of an increase in the number of phosphorylations may be to increase the probability that, upon disassociation, a ligand immediately rebinds to its receptor. How such effects may influence cell signaling systems is not well understood. A self-consistent integral equation formalism for ligand rebinding, in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulations, was employed to further investigate the effects of multiple, equivalent binding sites on shaping biological responses. Finally, this thesis also seeks to investigate cell signaling at a global scale. Advances in Mass Spectrometry based phosphoproteomics have allowed for the real-time quantitative monitoring of entire proteomes as signals propagate through complex networks in response to external signals. The trajectories of as many as 222 phosphorylated tyrosine sites can be simultaneously and reproducibly monitored at multiple time points. We develop and apply a method using the principle of maximum entropy to infer a model of network connectivity of these phosphorylation sites. The model predicts a core structure of signaling nodes, affinity dependent topological features of the network, and connectivity of signaling nodes that were hitherto unassociated with the canonical growth factor signaling network. Our combined results illustrate many complexities in the broad array of control properties that emerge from the physical effects that constrain signal propagation on complex biological networks.

Metakaryotic nuclei employ an unusual process for division in which DNA synthesis, partial genomic condensation, and separation of the two nuclei in a cup-from-cup fashion occur concurrently, as shown by Feulgen densitometry and single-stranded DNA assays by Dr. Elena Gostjeva. This is clearly different from the sequential steps of S-phase DNA synthesis, chromatin condensation, chromosomal separation, and genomic segregation that occur in mitotic eukaryotic cells. In order to discover how a genome apparently devoid of chromosomes might be organized, this thesis focused on recognizable DNA sequences common to all chromosomes: centromeres and telomeres. Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) with pan-centromeric and pan-telomeric probes was applied to samples of human tissue. (A collaborating lab used centromeric and telomeric antibodies to confirm results.) An optimized FISH protocol was developed specifically for metakaryotic nuclei and tested in both human cell lines and eukaryotic cells as experimental controls. Staining of metakaryotic nuclei resulted in approximately 23 centromeric regions in each, unlike the expected number of 46 regions seen in eukaryotic nuclei. Many of these staining regions contained paired centromere signals, or doublets. This suggested a genomic organization of homologous chromosomes paired at their centromere regions. If this were the case, one would expect 46 telomeric signals per nuclei, if telomeres were also homologously paired. (cont.) Unexpectedly, an average of 23 telomeric regions were found in many, if not all, bell-shaped metakaryotic nuclei. This, along with the observation of a condensed double ring around the mouth of the bell-shaped nuclei, suggested the possibility of a genome organized as paired, continuous genomic circles. Studies of telomere joining in metakaryotic nuclei by Dr. Per Olaf Ekstrom have provided further evidence for the paired genomic circle model. The results in this thesis are an original contribution to the field of stem cell physiology, a starting point for further investigation of DNA organization, synthesis, and repair in these metakaryotic cells, and hopefully will lead to a greater understanding of human development, growth, and cancer.

In this thesis, we use a systems approach combining quantitative experiments with computational modeling and analysis to understand the regulation of the survival-vs-death decision. A second goal of this thesis was to develop modeling and analysis methods that enable study of signals that are transient or at intermediate activation levels. We addressed the challenge of balancing mechanistic detail and ease of interpretation in modeling by adapting fuzzy logic to analyze a previously published experimental dataset characterizing the dynamic behavior of kinase pathways governing apoptosis in human colon carcinoma cells. Simulations of our fuzzy logic model recapitulated most features of the data and generated several predictions involving pathway crosstalk and regulation. Fuzzy logic models are flexible, able to incorporate qualitative and noisy data, and powerful enough to generate not only quantitative predictions but also biological insights concerning operation of signaling networks. To study transient signals in differential-equation based models, we employed direct Lyapunov exponents (DLEs) to identify phase-space domains of high sensitivity to initial conditions. These domains delineate regions exhibiting qualitatively different transient activities that would be indistinguishable using steady-state analysis but which correspond to different outcomes. (cont.) We combine DLE analysis of a physicochemical model of receptor-mediated apoptosis with single cell data obtained by flow cytometry and FRET-based reporters in live-cell microscopy to classify conditions that alter the usage of two apoptosis pathways (Type I/II apoptosis).

        "text": "Noncovalent adsorption of nucleotides in gold nanoparticle DNA conjugates : bioavailability at the bio-nano interface The practical viability of biomolecule-nanostructure hybrids depends critically on the functional and structural stability of biomolecules in application environments. Noncovalent interactions of biochemical functional groups with nanostructure surfaces can significantly disrupt biomolecular structure and function. We report a systematic study of the effect of DNA sequence on the binding interaction between gold nanoparticles and thiolated DNA (AuNp-DNA). Base specific noncovalent nucleotide adsorption on gold surfaces can affect nucleotide bioavailability in solution. Systematic investigation of DNA oligonucleotide sequence, the location of specific sequence motifs, and the effect of nanoparticle size was performed. Sequence effects on DNA coverage and oligonucleotide adsorption affinities.were studied by Langmuir isotherm analysis. The nanoparticle coverage at saturating concentrations of thiolated DNA varied with oligonucleotide sequence. Saturation coverages correlated well with complement hybridization efficiency. From this we concluded that noncovalent interactions between nucleotides and the particle surface effect both hybridization and DNA coverage and adsorption. This hypothesis was confirmed by chemical treatment of the particle surface to eliminate noncovalent interactions. Upon treatment the effect of sequence on hybridization efficiency was removed. The effect of sequence is not consistent across nanoparticle sizes. Different bases show the highest saturation coverages and hybridization efficiencies on different AuNp sizes. These results allow for sequence selection guidelines based on AuNp size for sizes ranging from 4-11nm. For smaller particles (<5nm) adenine rich sequences show the highest saturation coverage and hybridization efficiency. (cont.) For mid-sized particles (~7.5nm), guanine sequences show the highest saturation coverage and hybridization efficiency. Larger particles (>10nm) show little sequence dependent behavior and are likely the best choice for uses where sequence choice is limited. Sequence selection based on these guidelines will provide AuNp-DNA conjugates with the highest possible oligonucleotide bioavailability, maximizing their utility in biotechnology applications.
