It aims at the visualization and analysis of migration pattern of the creative individuals within Amsterdam during the Dutch Golden Age.

In this study, we compared Saikaku, Dansui, and Ichirōemon by the most frequent words, Japanese particles, Japanese particle bigrams, character unigram, character bigrams and character trigrams using principal component analysis (PCA) to see the differences in each author. Thus, Saikaku, Dansui and Ichirōemon’s novels made each group. Moreover, as said in qualitative research, Saikaku and Dansui’s novel showed closer and Ichirōemon showed different characteristics, specially Sayogoromo.

In this study, we compared Saikaku, Dansui, and Ichirōemon by the most frequent words, Japanese particles, Japanese particle bigrams, character unigram, character bigrams and character trigrams using principal component analysis (PCA) to see the differences in each author. Thus, Saikaku, Dansui and Ichirōemon’s novels made each group. Moreover, as said in qualitative research, Saikaku and Dansui’s novel showed closer and Ichirōemon showed different characteristics, specially Sayogoromo. We on-going digitize Dansui, Ichirōemon and the other writers' text data. In the future analysis, we will add works and the other writers for comparisons the relationship of the seventeenth century Japanese authors works.",

    "abstract": "HORAE (Hours, Recognition, Analysis, Editions) is a cross-disciplinary research project studying the religious practices and experiences in the late Middle Ages and Renaissance as evidenced by the medieval bestseller, Books of Hours. Developing tools in artificial intelligence, computer vision and image analysis, in Natural Language Processing (NLP), and in manuscript studies, book history and religious practices, HORAE also implements diverse tools developed in the DH community (network analysis, data visualization, text mining). This paper presents HORAE as a research Gesamtkunstwerk that tackles a common challenge of complexity, uncertainty and granularity with different tools from different fields. By broadening the perspective in a genuinely cross-disciplinary research, we argue that DH is not a specific field of the humanities, but an integral (and to-be-integrated) part of current research methodologies.",

This research explores the poetic similarity between the Irish poet W. B. Yeats and four related English Romantic poets, whose influence can be discerned in Yeats’s poetry. Adopting digital approaches, we build a model to quantitatively analyze the poetic similarity among authors in three aspects: intertextuality, formal elements (including rhyme type, meter style and enjambment), and sentiment. After analyzing 1090 poetic works by Yeats and four English Romantic poets and interpreting the results, we find the poetic similarity between Yeats and Blake to be the most significant, corresponding with previous literary critics’ views and leaving room for further explorations. The research's findings assist previous literary studies and its methods may shed light on further studies concerning Yeats’s complex relationship with Romanticism.",

Cultural collections can contain thousands of artifacts, of which each typically possesses a diverse set of properties constituting a unique relationship to the rest of the collection. Therefore, to create an appropriate representation of the complex data of each underlying artifact, oftentimes it is not only interesting to get an overview about the entire collection from one perspective, but to explore the particular context and relations of individual items. To investigate the potential of relational perspectives we selected an art collection as a particularly promising case study. By following a collaborative and iterative design process with an art museum, we developed a web interface that contrasts a collection overview with three perspective-dependent views to examine the viability of this approach and to expose the diversity of each artifact.",

There is no systematic analysis on big Tibetan textual collections in academic circle so far, thus we propose to apply digital textual analysis technology to deconstruct the great corpus of Tibetan treasure—Mahayoaga section in the Rin chen gter mdzod.

We present how we identify and analyse recurring images using an image hashing algorithm and a data visualisation tool. The reappearance of images, combined with bibliographic metadata, can offer insights into the kind of knowledge that is being taught, which images have been successful, as well as which images might have been exchanged between different printers and publishers.",

I could edit the TEI myself and the HTML, but I found this not a good solution. Could you help me find my mistake? I am currently out of ideas. Thank you!\n\nIn addition:\nI have many cuneiform characters in my publication. Those cuneiform characters might look different depending on the font being used. If a wrong font is used, my examples of the paleographic system do not make sense anymore. I therefore ask you to take particular care and to compare the cuneiform characters which were rendered correctly in the abstract PDF. If this seems not feasible with your workflow process please contact me and I will include images of the cuneiform characters. This would be suboptimal though as it was intended for the users to copy/paste the cuneiform characters if needed.",

    "abstract": "Many digital humanities projects have produced digitised archives and museums are increasingly integrating digital media into their visitor experiences. Some of these valuable historic databases have provided public access but can lack sustained public engagement. As Schreibman (2017) argued, public participation in cultural heritage can generate new ideas and could challenge the top-down division between researchers and the public (p. 281). In a move towards this notion, this paper proposes a novel approach to producing interactive digital narratives (IDN) that converge expert-produced content and user-generated content (UGC) with the aim of creating participatory cultural heritage narratives that also maintain narrative control. Examining the potential of IDN formats for creating cultural heritage narratives involves many facets of complexity and this paper will discuss these complexities in the context of how cultural analytics (Manovich, 2007) can be used to create IDNs.",

The specialized (‘odd’) customization presented here follows an explicit metamodel for metadata representation and expands the range of applications of the TEI metadata modules. This metamodel can be defined as a a format-independent, concrete and extensive content model for metadata information. The application of the metamodel benefits from the TEI environment and its interoperability, and can make use of the modeling tool ODD and its validation mechanism. This approach enables use cases for metadata that were previously separated from the TEI universe and proves that the adaptability and flexibility of the TEI allows reuse scenarios which have not been initially intended",

    "abstract": "This paper examines what metadata about Congressional hearings can tell us about shifts in the relative power of workers in American society over time. The metadata contains 941,302 instances of testimony between 1877 and 1990; it includes information about the witnesses appearing before Congressional committees as well as about the subjects of the hearings. This data is juxtaposed with strike and union density data to suggest that labor has been most consistently represented at Congressional hearings when a) it has engaged in electoral politics and b) it has possessed demonstrable strength in civil society as measured not only by isolated incidents but by consistent penetration. Future work hopes to juxtapose these data sets with actual legislative outcomes; merely being heard does not, after all, necessarily translate into being listened or deferred to. Such juxtapositions could help elucidate whether organizational strength converts to important outcomes as well as presence at hearings.",

In particular, we will describe the development and deployment of TextPAIR, a new sequence alignment system that detects reused passages in very large corpora. We use this software to compare several important collections of 18th-century texts to the Très Grande Bibliothèque (TGB) corpus of 19th-century printed materials made available by the Bibliothèque Nationale de France (BNF). While our interpretive work on this set of reuses is still in its initial phases, we have already been able to identify significant findings that challenge our understanding of the impact of the Lumières in the 19th century. Our full paper will expand upon these observations and begin the systematic exposition of the various complexities of identifying text reuse at such an unprecedented scale.",

Bonds and conflicts between characters are indicative of hierarchical oppositions between represented identities. Drawing on extensive metadata of 2137 characters in a corpus of 170 novels, the present paper models conflicts between characters in present-day Dutch literary fiction. Using insights from network theory and narratology, this talks addresses conflicts between two characters (dyads), as well as between three characters (triads). First, a conflict score is introduced through which the more powerful party between two hostile characters can be determined. Second, the amount of social balance between subnetworks of three characters is tested. The results of these two approaches are interpreted in light of existing theories on conflicts in narratives. It will be argued that conflict situations co-shape the ideological representation of characters in literature, which can be mapped on a large scale with our approach.",

In order to address this problem, our consortium is developing a mobile application called “Amerigo” that will identify, map, and demonstrate Groningen’s links to the Atlantic World using techniques of digital mapping, storytelling, and curation. When tourists, residents, scholars or students walk through the city with Amerigo, they will read, hear, see, and co-create the stories of real historical characters from Groningen’s past. At the same time, by drawing on data produced within the application, the researchers will analyze how this diverse audience engages with urban space and culture, fellow participants, and the application itself. This innovative combination of features promises to make Amerigo at once a useful medium for historical research and an experimental platform for studying public engagement with urban heritage.",

The necessity of the deliberated exposure to computational methods is discussed widely, aiming to understand the potential and limitations of the tools. Our current research provides a case study which illustrates the complementation of automated and manual analyses to bridge the gap between the two approaches. A self-designed corpus of dystopian novels serves as data for the applicatioon of different sentiment analysis tools. While the manual investigation of dystopian novels leads to an understanding of the genre as primarily delivering a pessimistic world view, the compuational analyses do not only support this finding, but also challenge it. The latter points us in two directions: i) The tools need thorough investigation; ii) Textual sentiment analysis as such has to be put into question, since text does not carry intrinsic sentiments, but they are brought to the text through non-textual instances.",

Most digital archives and scholarly editions offer the traces of a work’s genesis as digitized items, side by side.

The ability to record these connections facilitates a more comprehensive understanding of a work’s genesis. This implies a dynamic model that allows users to turn the different genetic traces into the “motion picture” of the genesis. With the proposed model, zooming in on the smallest level of textual change no longer entails the danger of getting lost in the manuscripts thanks to the possibility to zoom out again at every stage in the enquiry and see the bigger picture.",

To sketch a prototype for scholarly, multimedia editions for theatre studies, the present authors embarked on a collaborative journey of creativity and discussion. Both authors have an interest in the Javanese tradition of _wayang kulit_ (shadow puppet theatre). We are currently collaborating on an interactive, multimedia version of a previously published print translation of an influential performance. The development of a digital portal is not just a matter of ‘adding’ audiovisual materials but a dialogical experimentation with the format and possibilities of a digital philology of performance, which we undertake with reference to previous work on digital scholarly editions in other disciplines.

We explain the congruence we have found between debates on consciousness and the currently-dominant understanding within scholarship of digital textuality. Based on three use cases, we then contend that understanding digital text as an emergent property of interconnected knowledge, rather than as a purely semiotic description, creates new affordances for textual scholarship that are complementary to the current status quo of digitally mediated text as mimesis of print culture.",

To connect musicological collections and repositories, we created a metasearch for annotated music: IncipitSearch. It is a tool and a service specifically tailored for research on music incipits, the initial sequences of notes that characterize a work. IncipitSearch is a service to interconnect musical pieces via metadata. It is also a tool that can be reintegrated into existing digital research platforms. By connecting some of the largest digital collections of music metadata it already offers access to around 1 million incipits. In four comprehensible steps, this poster will be a guide explaining how data owners can add their data to IncipitSearch and how the reimplementation of the search functionality can be carried out.",

To illustrate the potential use of our setup, we first introduce VedaWeb, a web-based platform that provides access to ancient Indian texts written in Vedic Sanskrit, the oldest form of ancient Indo-Aryan. Then we describe the C-SALT APIs for Dictionaries. These APIs make several large Pāli and Sanskrit dictionaries available. Building on that, we present the architecture behind these APIs and finally we summarize by analyzing the potential role of APIs in Digital Humanities projects.",

    "abstract": "We will report on recent developments in the encoding, representation, and citation of musical scores in a digital environment. Our work centers on an important but neglected corpus of sixteenth-century music (the Imitation Mass) in which composers adapted, quoted, and transformed pre-existing works as the basis of long cyclic settings of the Catholic Mass. The aural and textual resonances of these works are of intrinsic interest from a cultural standpoint. But of primary importance in the context of the Digital Humanities is the challenges of representing the complex musical connections in a durable, collaborative environment. We do this through various open-source technologies, above all the Music Encoding Intiative (which brings to musical scores what the TEI does for literary and historical documents). The CRIM Project (Citations: The Renaissance Imitation Mass) inaugurates a new kind of quotable text for a digital age, with wide application in musicology, and beyond.",

    "abstract": "In this poster, we demonstrate how digital texts present a new and unique form of scholarly argumentation that both challenges and extends traditional methods by outlining our framework for a new digital book, Voice of a Nation: Mapping Documentary Expression in New America. This digital manuscript recovers the significant history of the Southern Life History Project (SLHP) by applying computational methods to analyze the collection. The SLHP was a unique project created under the New Deal in the U.S. to capture the stories over everyday Americans, especially those who had traditionally been marginalized in the historical record. The poster will make explicit the scholarly intervention of the project and then explain how the book’s arguments are being conveyed through digital forms, specifically organized around layers and thick mapping building off of the spatial turn in digital history.",

The idea is to characterize the notion of ``interesting connection'' in terms of generic ontological explanation patterns that are applied to an underlying linked data repository to instantiate connections. In this way, 1) semantically uninteresting connections can be ruled out effectively, and 2) natural language explanations about the connections can be created for the end-user. The idea has been implemented and tested based on a knowledge graph of biographical data, enriched by data linking to collection databases of museums, libraries, and archives.

    "abstract": "What do animals do in the pages of fiction? Do they make decisions, have feelings, express interiority? Are they more similar to human characters, or to things, objects, and machines? In this paper, we approach these questions with computational methods in one of the first attempts to apply digital methods to animal studies. In a variety of corpora—from popular natural history to scientific writing about animal behavior to animal-driven fictions historically accused of anthropomorphism—we compare the semantic and syntactic footprints left behind by animals and humans. We discover that, from a computational standpoint, animals in fiction are indeed recognizable as characters, albeit characters who register intentionality through physical movement over speech and display a mental paradigm delimited by instinct and associative learning. Natural history writing, on the other hand, narrates animals in ways that seem surprisingly human-like when compared to animal representations in fiction more broadly.",

    "abstract": "Although it is commonly assumed that the novel emerged during the 18th century, it has proven notoriously difficult to say what exactly was new about this new literary form. My work addresses this problem by starting with the novel’s new visual features: chapter headings and quotation marks. This paper presents research on the latter. Over the course of the 18th century, the look and purpose of the quotation mark transformed dramatically within the English novel. A survey of genres shows that the novel played a principal role in this development (more than scientific journals, trial transcripts, poetry, and drama). It’s the gradual emergence of a new literary device within a new literary genre—a consequence of the novel’s “new and important role of dialogue” (Lukács). What’s more, the quotation mark led to the conceptual clarification and prominence of “direct discourse,” a necessary step for the emergence of free indirect discourse.",

Fortunately, prices have fallen as technical solutions have evolved. However, reduced prices, like VR systems, have developed to facilitate gaming. This paper presents strategies for building an interdisciplinary VR system. As its case study, it uses the Oklahoma Virtual Academic Laboratory (OVAL), developed at the University of Oklahoma through an interdisciplinary and multi-university approach. OVAL is a scholarly-oriented, human-centered VR system. It is free to download and use. Strategies include cultivating partnerships with other universities (facilitated by presenting early work at DH 2016), recruiting researchers from across campus, and building a 2-person traveling VR workstation (to engage international scholars). These strategies have been essential to address the complexities of human experience and develop a flexible VR system to meet diverse disciplinary needs.",

We also suggest how these tools could evolve beyond their origins in the K-12 arena to provide a shared platform for teaching computational thinking in the digital humanities.

In IIIF-compatible digital collections, images are retrieved via IIIF Image API, where regions of images are specified. Thus, it is possible to investigate the detailed image usage by examining which regions of images have been requested. In this paper, we propse a log analysis method to measure the image usage and to visualize the analysis result. Specifically, we employ the number of accesses to each pixel as a metric and visualize the result by heat maps. Since a pixel is the smallest unit that composes an image, we enable a fine-grained analysis. For instance, the analysis method can be applied to research platform, in which heat maps show which regions have been already examined by collaborators.",

The project’s history, and the motivations of the volunteers, have been presented elsewhere. This paper presents the final outputs, which can be divided into a place-name gazetteer, arguably the most detailed freely available gazetteer of Britain, and possibly the largest specifically historical gazetteer for any country; and other textual information on the maps. A series of visualisations are presented based on the diverse other types of transcription. We argue that the maps, which contain no symbology, only text and the outlines of features, form an unusual but compellingly descriptive textual corpus, documenting Britain’s cultural landscape.",

Overview and detail are typically positioned as opposites in the visual representation of information spaces. However, when visualizing image collections annotated by art historians, there is an opportunity to reveal the visual details of individual images while at the same time exposing iconographic patterns prevalent within a collection. As part of an iterative research and design process in collaboration with a museum of arts and crafts, we have devised a visualization technique that arranges detailed close-ups into frequency-based collages. The resulting visual interface is designed for open-ended exploration of digitized glass plate negatives without requiring prior knowledge about the collection or the need for entering search queries. We implemented the concept as a web-based interface and evaluated the potential of the approach.",

One of the perennial debates related to the problematic raised by computation is that knowledge and its processing is enveloped within a black-boxed structure which obscures or hides the internal workings of the machine. This has implications not just for programmers, but also for those who rely on computational techniques, such as the digital humanities. Moreover, as algorithms continue to penetrate into broader society, major difficulties are raised when important decisions are made which cannot be understood or checked – this has democratic implications. But not only are decisions and the decision-making process often obscured, the form of knowledge and mode of thought itself are often veiled. These debates have been given greater intensity with the rise of machine-learning systems that are fully able to automate much more complex decision-making processes than the previous generation of algorithms.",

This poster presentation examines a born-digital literary story and shows how keystroke logging data provided by Inputlog can help interpret revisions made during the writing process. It focusses both on small revisions and on the construction of the beginning of the story (incipit) and tries to examine whether the small revisions can be linked to the changes made in the opening passage. We will study both the versions of the text and the process data from Inputlog; we cannot only see which revisions were made to create the ultimate incipit but also when – in the complete writing process.",

Moore thus implicitly, and perhaps intuitively, hypothesized that the critical appreciation of graphic novels and memoirs may have a formal basis. In this paper, we describe the operationalization of Moore’s concept of density with the help of a total of six textual and visual measures. We then present a pilot study of 40 graphic narratives drawn from a larger corpus, six of which can be described as canonical examples of this genre given their frequent discussion in academic scholarship. Our pilot study provides empirical evidence that clearly supports Moore’s hypothesis that critically esteemed, or canonical, graphic novels and memoirs are characterized by higher density.",

Based on a dataset of four Dutch newspapers that span the period 1840-1990, we show how conceptual connections between the members of the MCE trinity are highly restricted. N-gram frequency measures and collocations are employed to map the word usage and, building on recent advancements in diachronic vector semantics, we use word embeddings to study changing relations between modernity, civilization and Europe. These methods show how the trinity is characterized by intermittent and alternating connections, but not by perennial semantic boundaries. Given that these results differ from research based on elite discourse, this paper demonstrates the need for digital research into conceptual interrelationships.",

The impact of neoliberalism in food culture can be traced back to the postwar period and has been summarised by the paradox that worthy neoliberal citizens \"must want less while spending more\". This paper focuses on the extent to which the major Dutch retailer Albert Heijn appropriated this tendency in its framing of the products it tried to sell. A digital text analysis of Albert Heijn's food magazine Allerhande for the period 1954-1973 shows, for example, how the qualifications of \"healthy\", \"slim\", \"tasty\", and \"pure\" became discursively interlaced from the mid-1960s, and how the magazine offered a platform for products like margarine to brand themselves within this discourse. For the final paper, the studied period will be extended to cover the period until 2010.",

In a first step, we will offer a precise framework for estimating a spectrum of (dis-)fluency by using two important theories for analyzing poetry: The grammetrical ranking and the rhythmic phrasing. In a second step, we will establish a gradual one-dimensional continuum, whose two poles are denoted by the terms fluent and dis-fluent. We illustrate this prosodic spectrum by ranking nine different poetic styles respectively prosodic patterns within a corpus of free verse poetry. We collected German poems available on the website of our partner (www.lyrikline.org). We present a model for the automatic classification of rhythmical patterns in the free verse poetry by using deep hierarchical attention networks.",

    "abstract": "The eighteenth century entailed a rapid change in reading and writing books. To trace changing practices of reading, we have analysed how smaller book formats, in particular the octavo format, became more popular in the eighteenth century. Smaller books could be easily transported, carried in a pocket to places where individuals could read in solitude. To assess the change in the material dimensions of books and other print, we turned to four large bibliographies. Altogether, they cover 2.64 million harmonized entries from the period before 1830. The statistical analysis shows clearly how the octavo format became more popular in Europe toward the end of the eighteenth century, but also indicates that the development was uneven in the sense that the timing and speed of the development varied according to location. We further use the analysis to discuss types of towns based on the profiles of books produced in them.",

While there is now a wide variety of uses in different fields, many projects highlight the difficulty of bringing graph theory and their discipline into dialogue.

Often addressed in relation to graphical representation, the subjectivity of _translation_ is all the more important when it comes to interpreting structural metrics.

This has proven to be a serious obstacle for research on narrative texts.\n\nWe are interested in a segment of the discours of a narrative which presents a part of the histoire in such a way that time is more or less equal in discours and histoire, place stays the same it centers around a particular action, and the character configuration is equal.\n\nWe understand our panel as first step towards modeling, annotating and automatically detecting scenes as such multi-dimensional phenomena. In this first step, we will look into approaches for manually annotating scenes, the relation between just one aspect, character or time, with scenes and a weakly supervised approach for the detection of scenes.",

This consists of a series of online open source lessons created to teach students how to apply source criticism to retro-digitised and digital born data.\n\nThe poster explains the relevance of digital source criticism, listing the key questions that should be posed to both analogue and digital sources.\n\nIt also presents the core Ranke2 teaching principles:\n\n1. Differentiation in complexity and time required, to connect to different teaching contexts. This means lecturers can choose between the modules SMALL( an animation and/or a quiz), MEDIUM (a series of assignments) or LARGE (a tutorial for a hands on workshop).\n\n2. Offering teaching content in a variety of attractive interactive formats: colourful animations, quizzes, assignments for web research, and tutorials for a hands on workshop.",

    "abstract": "Oral transmission, not only of entire songs but also of smaller musical units, so-called licks, formulas or patterns, plays an important role in jazz. These patterns greatly facilitate the construction of very fast lines typical for jazz. Here, we present a case study of a common bebop lick. Using a newly developed similarity search system, we found 100 instances of the search pattern and the variants in the 456 jazz solo transcriptions from the Weimar Jazz Database. Despite a great deal of variation, certain structural invariants regarding metrical and harmonic placements can be observed and a prototypical version can be reconstructed. The lick was popularized by Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, probably based on earlier models from the swing era, and then spread to other bebop and hard bop players. Even modern post-bop players are still using this pattern, presumably as a direct reference to the bebop masters.",

We focus on an algebra inspired by the German tradition of *Begriffsgeschichte* (conceptual history), as exemplified by the work of Reinhart Koselleck.

When viewed from the perspective of the digital humanities, six distinct points of ‘aporia’ with a significant impact on DH appear in this corpus, places where the interviewees explicitly or tacitly expose gulfs in epistemic culture that are clearly at the heart of tensions between disciplines as they seek to collaborate. This paper will explore these areas of apparent irreconcilability, and conclude with a series of reflections on how digital humanities researchers might develop to become uniquely able to negotiate some of these critical conversations.",

The first part towards automatic annotation is to recognise the exact time-frame a sign occurs. To remove the redundant information from the raw video a pose estimation framework (namely OpenPose) has been used. The extracted hand locations have been used to train four different classifiers. The result of this process is a tool that uses XGBoost to accurately predict the span of a sign and automatically create the annotation slot.",

In this paper, we will present the step-by-step process that will unravel the accessibility barriers of this repertoire: (i) lack of high-quality digital images, (ii) notation style, and (iii) layout. This process will result in the digitization and encoding of the repertoire as musical scores in a machine-readable file format, which would facilitate its dissemination, study by musicologists, and appreciation by the general public. We expect this research to be used as a model for the digitization of the mensural repertoire of other countries that were once part of the colonial past.",

The objective of this API is to promote the re-use of this important resource, but also to continue to enrich it by providing researchers with an interface to correct and complete the content as they discover it. This paper aims to promote this essential resource for toponymic research: we will present the history of this publishing initiative, detailing the steps involved in digitization, restructuring and data enrichment. Finally, we will present the API and the associated application that makes it possible to exploit new relationships within the _Dictionnaire_, and above all, to revitalize an unfinished editorial initiative.",

Our paper highlights that a model trained on only a limited amount of data achieves state-of-the-art performance and beats commercial software like ABBYY FineReader by oftentimes large margins. We are particularly interested in how HTR models trained on medium-resolution data perform on high-resolution images and we are able to show that the performance is comparable, which means that costly and time-consuming re-digitisation processes are not required in order to improve OCR quality.

The medieval civilization can only be investigated by means of the study of traces that have survived to our times. The best source of our knowledge is the texts, preserved in huge quantity and variety. Written mainly in Medieval Latin, they have not benefited from recent advances in computational linguistics.\n\nTo challenge this situation we will build a large and balanced corpus of Medieval Latin texts composed between 500 and 1500 AD all across Europe. It will be annotated with PoS, lemma, time and place labels. Tools allowing efficient statistical analysis and data visualization will be developed. The texts and tools will be made freely available to the scientific community, to help researchers answer their own questions or discover new ones.",

Our analysis of the data shows that the digitised newspapers are by no means uniform in their materiality, and further that changes and aberrations in the material aspects correlate with changes and aberrations in content. Thus, besides allowing to study the material development of newspapers in itself, the information is useful for both the discovery of anomalies as well as partitioning the data into more uniform subsets for content analysis.",

This aims to improve data reliability and completeness through systematic and reproducible harmonization, deriving from the paradigms of open science and data science. We have constructed a comprehensive bibliographic data science ecosystem that facilitates semi-automatic harmonization and enrichment of bibliographic entries. The work is based on an iterative process where research use often leads to new enhancements in data processing. The overall ecosystem integrates a number of distinct workflows that are dedicated to harmonizing specific subsets of the data collections. Further algorithmic tools support the integration with other data sources, such as full text collections, and final statistical analysis, visualization, and summarization of the data.

This aims to improve data reliability and completeness through systematic and reproducible harmonization, deriving from the paradigms of open science and data science. We have constructed a comprehensive bibliographic data science ecosystem that facilitates semi-automatic harmonization and enrichment of bibliographic entries. The work is based on an iterative process where research use often leads to new enhancements in data processing. The overall ecosystem integrates a number of distinct workflows that are dedicated to harmonizing specific subsets of the data collections. Further algorithmic tools support the integration with other data sources, such as full text collections, and final statistical analysis, visualization, and summarization of the data. As such, bibliographic data science can advance the methodological and conceptual basis in book history and digital humanities.",

To represent the complex ontologies of the contents of promptbooks, our research team is developing an approach that uses two data files linked by stand-off markup and XPointers, one for the verbal text that a stage manager uses as a timeline during a performance, and the other for the non-verbal events the stage manager enacts or monitors (Roberts-Smith, Kaethler, Malone et al. forthcoming).

To remedy this, I survey the relevant theoretical landscape, outline a methodology for generating time maps, and theorize on their possible forms. Time maps are particularly relevant for temporal narratologists because these graphs visualize the ordering framework Gérard Genette developed in Narrative Discourse. Instead of simply tracking the order of a scene's position in the fabula, as others have done, I incorporate numerical values from the text to create time maps of unrivaled accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Stylometric analysis of medieval vernacular texts is still much of a challenge: the importance of scribal variation, be it graphic or more substantial, as well as the variants and errors introduced in the tradition, complicates the task of the would-be stylometrist. Basing the analysis on the study of the copy from a single hand of several texts can partially be a way around this issue (Camps & Cafiero, 2012), but the limited availability of complete diplomatic transcription might make it difficult. In this paper, we use a workflow combining handwritten text recognition and stylometric analysis, and apply it to the case of the hagiographic works contained in MS BnF, fr. 412. We seek to evaluate Paul Meyer's hypothesis about the constitution of groups of hagiographic works, as well as to examine potential authorial groupings in a vastly anonym corpus.",

Social reading platforms like Goodreads and Wattpad are online environments where millions of people from all over the world come to share their love for the written word.\n\nWith this panel, we will showcase the potential of studying social reading through the combination of multiple and interrelated approaches: from purely statistical, data-driven analyses, through qualitative and quantitative surveys of key users and a theory-driven qualitative taxonomy of reading valuation, towards a combination of the empirical and the computational, supported by a sound theoretical/methodological awareness. The substantial variety of case studies in four languages (English, German, Italian, and Dutch) will reflect the diversity of social reading, which can and should be studied from multiple points of view as well as with an array of methodological tools.",

While a significant amount of attention has of late been focused on the general problem of 'fake news' within digital humanities research, this paper proposes to take an empirically focused approach to broader seemingly philosophical problem of epistemological relativism in landscape of contemporary social media. Specifically it proposes to consider how it is that social media platforms, in this case YouTube, seem to create conditions amenable to the recruitment and mobilization of far-right politics, particularly via the medium of pseudo-intellectual debate. Our paper looks at how hate speech patterns by commenters on Youtube can be obfuscated into extreme speech. Specifically we consider how this may occur via commenters presenting their arguments in a pseudo-academic format.",

    "abstract": "This paper shows how the systematic and quantitative study of genre in large digitized newspaper collections sheds light on the development of journalism discourse. It adopts a machine learning approach to add genre labels to newspaper articles. Classifying genre in a standardized and reliable manner is challenging, though, because genre is a typical example of a ‘latent’ content category, which needs considerable interpretation. To ensure the reliability of the results and to evaluate the machine learning approach, it is crucial to make the methodological impact of various machine learning pipelines transparent. In order to make an informed decision on the right pipeline and understand its inherent biases, we have developed a dashboard that allows the scholar to explore the underlying decision-making process of the machine learning pipeline. Our study aims to gain insight in how the machine learning pipelines' output compares to the distribution of manually coded golden standard data.",

    "abstract": "We present a tool for viewing patterns in the position of words in poems. Given a collection of 10,000 English-language sonnets, we stretch each poem to fit a standardized square, with each line fully justified. We then create a visualization for each distinct word showing the position of all instances of that word. For example, we find that \"start\" and \"apart\" appear almost always at the end of lines, and that \"start\" rarely occurs in the first line. The visualization allows scholars to gain an abstracted view of poetry without losing the poets' individual choices about word placement. This tool can help scholars generate and test theories about the interplay of rhyme, meter, syntax, and emphasis.",

    "abstract": "Although there is a scientific consensus that gender is not binary, immutable, and physiological, it is still common to operationalize it in such a way. Recently, there have been more attempts to critically assess and change these exclusive practices. This contribution joins these efforts by describing our attempt to measure gender of film directors by relying on their own chosen self-representation. The research stems from a study on circulation of films within film festival networks. Gender of directors constitutes an important piece of information due to known discriminatory practices in film industry. In our operationalization of gender, we focused on directors’ ways to use personal pronouns on available web resources. We also compare our results to alternative findings when binary manual and automatic gender detection methods are used. In communicating the comparisons, we visualize the data to invite others to critically reflect on current practices of gender operationalization.",

This paper describes HuViz, the Humanities Visualizer, a digital tool for visualizing semantic relationships and ontologies represented using the Resource Description Framework (RDF). Though not conceived as an environment to foster serendipitous experiences, HuViz has proven through user studies conducted over the past two years to do just that. After providing background on its development, we demonstrate how HuViz aligns with specific design features from the library and information science (LIS) literature on fostering serendipity. Finally, we demonstrate how participant feedback and observation led to the development of three new features in HuViz, which we will briefly demonstrate and connect back to the literature on serendipity.",

The aim is not only to recuperate national histories of women’s writing but also to establish how feminist ideas were disseminated as texts crossed national and linguistic borders.

ABM is a computational process simulating agents and their behaviors; the relationships between agents; and the interaction between agents and their environments. In our prototype of the Istanbul Toptasi Insane Asylum (functioned 1876-1924), we model medical and daily routines of the asylum inhabitants. This setting presents both a computational and philosophical challenge considering that agents are typically assumed to be active, autonomous individuals with decision-making capability in a non-restricted environment. In contrast, the asylum is a highly regulated environment with unpredictable (and arguably irrational) agents. The asylum presents a productive case study of applying ABM to art/architectural history as the movement of agents provides insight into the functioning of a nineteenth century imperial medical facility.",

With the use of statistical analysis of relative frequencies, we identify as \"character language\" words that are used by the author importantly more often in characters' speeches than in the narrator's text, and we show that their infrequent but salient occurrences in narrator text contribute to perspectival effects. Importantly, not all of the \"character language\" words are ones that at first sight encode perspective-sensitive meanings, and so they could not be identified without the quantitative approach. We discuss the consequences of our findings for the study of narratives and for the linguistics of perspective-sensitive items.",

However, given the technological advances of the last few decades, this role has been continuously transforming; the emergence of digital humanities, in particular, raises new challenges for libraries. This paper investigates current practices in research libraries across the UK and Ireland concerning the support of or involvement in digital humanities research. Exploring the different models of engagement that libraries follow when it comes to working with digital humanities researchers, the nature of these professional relationships as well as the benefits and challenges they involve will hopefully increase our knowledge about an institutional side of the digital humanities in the UK and Ireland that remains largely undocumented.",

This project employs a factoid-based approach to prosopography. Where most factoid-based prosopographies organize data in a relational database, SPEAR encodes prosopographical data from primary source texts in TEI XML using a customized schema designed to facilitate linking this propopographical data to other linked data resources and for serialization into RDF. SPEAR shows how a prosopography project can employ TEI, field-specific scholarly standards, and Linked Open Data to produce a highly structured and semantically rich database that maintains close ties to the texts from which it is derived.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes significant decisions involved in creating an ontology for feminist literary history with a view to its extensibility to other literary and cultural work. It outlines the pragmatic process of designing an ontology to mobilize the data of The Orlando Project and eventually other data from the Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory. The principles and decisions outlined are: antifoundationalism and representationality; deferred upper-level ontology; provenance and citation; annotation; ambiguity, diversity, and nuance; and linking to legacy terms. It concludes that there are major challenges in the tensions between complexity and nuance, on the one hand, and readability and processability on the other, as well as between standards and bespoke terms. The Orlando British Women’s Writing Dataset will advance feminist digital literary history, and experiments with the CWRC ontology will help refine strategies for writing feminist literary history, among other complicated stories, into the Web.",

    "abstract": "The explication of poetic meter in the modern languages of South Asia is a source of consternation even for experienced poets, let alone readers and scholars. Urdu poetry, for example, is written in meters drawn from Perso-Arabic and Indic sources. Traditionally, these two metrical systems take their rules for versification from poetic traditions in what are considered their traditional source-languages: classical Arabic, on the one hand, and Sanskrit, on the other. The trouble is, neither poetic system aligns well with the phonological features of modern South Asian languages. As a result, the Arabic system quickly becomes combinatorially explosive, leading to multiple acceptable scansions. Modern scholars have offered alternative ways to think of meter. We augment that work by presenting an interactive web-based software package under development to visualize poetic meter using directed graphs that accommodate multiple languages and scripts to make accessible poetic knowledge for readers, scholars, and poets.",

These tasks are crucial for producing enriched Digital Editions as well as for Digital Literary Stylistics and Spatial Humanities which largely rely on Distant Reading techniques. Our pipeline is able to provide a dynamic cartography and allows for the exploration of the spatial dimension of texts by retrieving structured information about places.

    "abstract": "The eponymous character in Jean Toomer's \"Kabnis\" resists easy racial classification: not only is he is described in mixed racial epithets (metaphors, for instance, like \"lemon face\"), but his speech, while occasionally dialectal, toes the line between an African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) register and the register of a standardized English. Leaving his racial identity to the interpretation of readers, literary scholars need to establish new methods through which to analyze this text, particularly when it is performed.

    "abstract_plain": "The eponymous character in Jean Toomer's \"Kabnis\" resists easy racial classification: not only is he is described in mixed racial epithets (metaphors, for instance, like \"lemon face\"), but his speech, while occasionally dialectal, toes the line between an African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) register and the register of a standardized English. Leaving his racial identity to the interpretation of readers, literary scholars need to establish new methods through which to analyze this text, particularly when it is performed. The developing field of sound studies provides one such method. Using pause and pitch trackers in combination with visualization software, we can begin to identify and analyze the nonsemantic qualities associated with radicalized performance, with the resulting quantitative data being an asset to potential arguments about the politics of vernacular voice in audio text.",

It seeks to understand the kinds of relationships between countries which can be discerned by examining the text of legal documents that regulate economic interactions between those countries, and the relationship between the documents themselves, with a particular focus on the influence of earlier documents on later documents. The visualisation methods used include the visual clustering of documents based on topic similarity, bimodal network visualisations, and word embeddings rendered in two dimensions.",

These archives act as vital testimonials for oral history, politics and human rights. As such, they are usually either transcribed, or meticulously indexed. In this project, we look at the nonverbal signals emitted by victims of various traumatic events and seek to render these for novel representations that are capable of representing the trauma without the explicit (and often highly politicized) content. In particular, we propose to detect breathing and silence patterns during the speeches of trauma patients for visualization and sonification.",

In this project, we look at the nonverbal signals emitted by victims of various traumatic events and seek to render these for novel representations that are capable of representing the trauma without the explicit (and often highly politicized) content. In particular, we propose to detect breathing and silence patterns during the speeches of trauma patients for visualization and sonification.",

    "abstract": "Good authors imbue their characters with distinctive voices that are often discernible devoid of explicit dialog labels, both by their word choice as well as sometimes by the actual _sound_ of the words. For instance, in Shakespeare's _Othello_, the speech of the titular character is said to be characterized by longer, rounder vowel sounds than the quick speech of his counterpart Iago. Such a phenomenon provokes a wide variety of questions. Can we detect these differences in speech computationally? If so, what would it tell us about these characters? What would it tell us about the _author_? We developed a web-based tool to visualize the differences between the “sonic signatures” of different characters within Shakespeare’s plays.",

There are two main challenges of studying imperial historical records. The first is that the records are usually quite lengthy.

The second obstacle is that there is no publicly available text-mining tool that can extract person, location, time, and event mentions from Ming dynasty historical records. The aim of this work is to begin development of text-mining tools that tackle these two challenges. We focus on identifying tributary events in the Ming Shilu automatically by using SRL techniques.

The primary goal of the project is to produce an online dictionary (Latin-Hindustani-French) on the basis of the unpublished 'Thesaurus Linguae Indianae' by François-Marie de Tours (1). The shortcomings of the Uppsala project will guide the design of an extended cross-linked online dictionary of early modern Hindustani based on little known wordlists and vocabularies compiled by European merchants and missionaries in the 17th c. India. The novelty of the approach resides in combining multilingual sources describing a foreign language to create a ‘pan-European perspective’, which may offer new comparative insights for the historical linguistics of target languages. If successful, this approach can be applied to other early modern vocabularies constituting unique and valuable descriptions of non-European languages.",

As a test corpus, it uses four digitized, OCRed, and hand-cleaned nineteenth-century French chronicles of Ottoman Algerian history in order to model socio-political networks and uncover the positions and roles of women in this society. The challenge is to extract not only named entities and their relations to one another, but to extract unnamed persons and their relationships as well. Those who remain unnamed are most often women, servants, slaves, and Indigenous people – the very people about whom scholars are most anxious to know more. This short presentation will share the complete information extraction code, its accuracy, the resulting visualizations, a brief analysis from the case study, and additional use cases that extend far beyond the initial case study to other languages and textual sources.",

Our data reveal gender differences in the representation of female and male characters, point out differences in the representation of adult and child characters, and provide comparative material for the study of character embodiment in literary fiction.",

This step is especially crucial as scholars make intersections and linkages between place-based, data-driven research projects. The authors argue that the concepts for Event and Place used to encode semantic relationships overlook the fact that it is the Actor or Agent who names the events, and thus by extension names the places at which those events occurred. Place names connected with those events must correspond to those agents. In the brave new world of linked data, the vagaries of named places constitute a vexed problem, and attempts to resolve the messiness and fuzziness of place, time, and perspective run the risk of eliding the floating gap of cultural memory.",

Digital cinema studies have largely focused on textual analysis, or urban and regional case studies, without attending to film’s global circulation.

This Kinomatics panel draws on critical infrastructure studies to consider social, relational aspects of transnational film distribution as global, complex, elastic and networked. From within this long-term successful collaboration, panellists ask how disciplinary perspectives delineate our paths to knowledge and reflect expressions of, and interactions with, surfaces, spaces and speeds. Ultimately, our aim is to mobilise attentiveness to uneven acts of cultural and intellectual distribution so they might also be redistributed.",

Lorsque l’on passe au support numérique, ces conventions disparaissent en partie. A l'écran, il s'agit donc de reprendre les normes élaborées pour l’imprimé et de les faire évoluer afin qu'elles s'adaptent aux particularités du format numérique. Les éditeurs qui s’occupent des artefacts scientifiques numériques doivent donc d’une part reprendre certains codes sémiotiques du livre imprimé pour les adapter au nouveau format, et d’autre part inventer de nouveaux codes propres à l’environnement numérique.

Lorsque l’on passe au support numérique, ces conventions disparaissent en partie. A l'écran, il s'agit donc de reprendre les normes élaborées pour l’imprimé et de les faire évoluer afin qu'elles s'adaptent aux particularités du format numérique. Les éditeurs qui s’occupent des artefacts scientifiques numériques doivent donc d’une part reprendre certains codes sémiotiques du livre imprimé pour les adapter au nouveau format, et d’autre part inventer de nouveaux codes propres à l’environnement numérique.

Designed primarily for the palaeographical analysis of handwriting, it was first developed at King’s College London for the Digital Resource and Database for Palaeography, Manuscript Studies and Diplomatic (DigiPal) project, funded by the European Research Council, and has since been extended by the King’s Digital Lab particularly through the Models of Authority and Exon Domesday projects. Available as FOSS, it now used in around two dozen research projects, most of which are small private studies but some of which are the result of large funded research projects.",

Scholars hold on to engrained research practices drawn from specific research paradigms and they seldom venture outside their comfort zone. The inability to ‘reach across’ methods and tools arises from tight disciplinary boundaries, where terminology and literature may not overlap, or from different priorities placed upon digital skills in research. We believe that offering accessible and customized information on how to appreciate and use technology can help to bridge these gaps.\n\nThis workshop aims to break down some of these barriers by offering scholars who work with interview data the opportunity to apply, experiment and exchange tools and methods that have been developed in the realm of Digital Humanities.\n\nPrevious work\n\nAs a multidisciplinary group of European scholars, tools and data professionals, spanning the fields of speech technology, social sciences, human computer interaction, oral history and linguistics, we are interested in strengthening the position of interview data in Digital Humanities. Since 2016 we have organized a series of workshops, supported by CLARIN on this topic (https://oralhistory.eu).\n\nOur first concrete output was the development of the T-Chain, a tool that supports transcription and alignment of audio and text in multiple languages. Second we developed a format for experimenting with a variety of annotation, text analysis and emotion recognition tools as they apply to interview data.\n\nThe workshop\n\nThis half-day workshop will provide a fruitful cross-disciplinary knowledge exchange session. It will:\n- Use hands-on sessions to explore annotation, text analysis and emotion extraction tools with interview data;\n- Test the T-Chain with participants’ own audio-clips;\n- Attract open source Speech to Text software developers to expand the number of languages that could be integrated into the T-Chain.",

What are our tools and methods-in-use? How do they relate in terms of modeling and epistemological awareness? What functionalities are we missing and would like to have?\n\nThe current panorama in DLS presents a plethora of tools, protocols and practices for processing, analyzing and visualizing data. This diversity of practices and tools originating from different areas (e.g., stylometry, NLP, literary studies, corpus linguistics) has resulted in a rich, but atomized situation. To overcome this, there is a need to bring people together and discuss.\n\nOur workshop taps into the DLS Tool Inventory (DLS-TI), a first attempt to gather information on the practices of the various traditions present in DLS. Building on it, the workshop aims at taking stock, but also reflect on, our methods. Four use cases representing different types of digital methods/tools will undergo an “autopsy”: Invited scholars will each present their own use case, by way of applied tool criticism of the associated tool/library/method. They will analyze the use case by a list of criteria: (a) reasons for choosing the method; (b) the method’s impact on the analysis and results; (c) advantages and limitations.\n\nEach use case will be selected to represent a certain group of tools/methods (see below), motivated by (1) significance of the use case with regard to current trends in the field of DLS; (2) diversity in terms of disciplinary area, methodological approach, geographic areas, gender; (3) diversity in terms of tools and approaches (e.g., GUIs vs command line; tools vs libraries or other methods; DLS-specific vs generic).",

    "abstract": "DH2019’s theme Complexities asks the field “to focus on DH as the humanist way of building complex models of complex realities, analysing them with computational methods and communicating the results to a broader public.” Understanding the diversity of the human experience means turning to diverse sources, which includes the different forms in which people produce knowledge and communicate ways of knowing. One way that people make and communicate meaning is through audio and visuals. Forms such as drawing, film, and radio construct, convey, and circulate our complexities including beliefs, values, and histories. Analyzing these forms has become an increased object of study within DH; a field which has traditionally focused on text.

    "abstract_plain": "DH2019’s theme Complexities asks the field “to focus on DH as the humanist way of building complex models of complex realities, analysing them with computational methods and communicating the results to a broader public.” Understanding the diversity of the human experience means turning to diverse sources, which includes the different forms in which people produce knowledge and communicate ways of knowing. One way that people make and communicate meaning is through audio and visuals. Forms such as drawing, film, and radio construct, convey, and circulate our complexities including beliefs, values, and histories. Analyzing these forms has become an increased object of study within DH; a field which has traditionally focused on text. With this move from the periphery to the center of audio and visual (AV), scholars are turning to computational methods to increase the discovery, analysis, and accessibility of AV materials.\n\nThe AudioVisual in DH (AVinDH) SIG Workshop will bring together DH scholars interested in learning how to analyze AV materials.

    "abstract": "The future of digital humanities depends on its ability to survive within the multiple complexities of intellectual and institutional ecologies. Early intellectual ambitions of the field–to transform the humanities through an encounter with computational methods–seem to be lost in the use of standardized tools and platforms that foreclose critical inquiry through black-box procedures. Theoretical challenges from cultural studies, feminism, queer theory, critical race perspectives have raised additional questions about the extent to which digital humanities has a retrogressive effect—or is even complicit with neoliberal agendas within the university. Critical inquiry and discovery are caught between the commitment to decolonize long-standing knowledge practices and increased dependencies on environmentally costly infrastructure (often with reliance on corporate and proprietary systems). Unacknowledged contributions by information professionals, student workers, and other essential personnel depend on asymmetrical power hierarchies within academic and cultural institutions. The international supply chains on which digital infrastructure depends are involved in exploitative labor practices and damaging ecological activities in the global system. Is this ethically and intellectually sustainable?",

Early intellectual ambitions of the field–to transform the humanities through an encounter with computational methods–seem to be lost in the use of standardized tools and platforms that foreclose critical inquiry through black-box procedures. Theoretical challenges from cultural studies, feminism, queer theory, critical race perspectives have raised additional questions about the extent to which digital humanities has a retrogressive effect—or is even complicit with neoliberal agendas within the university. Critical inquiry and discovery are caught between the commitment to decolonize long-standing knowledge practices and increased dependencies on environmentally costly infrastructure (often with reliance on corporate and proprietary systems). Unacknowledged contributions by information professionals, student workers, and other essential personnel depend on asymmetrical power hierarchies within academic and cultural institutions. The international supply chains on which digital infrastructure depends are involved in exploitative labor practices and damaging ecological activities in the global system. Is this ethically and intellectually sustainable?",

The African tradition of self-extension through creative imagination that privilege cosmologies and ontologies of interconnections in myriad ways, holds great promise for theorising the intersections between humans and ICTs.\n\nJuju as used in this address is a technology of self-activation and self-extension – something that enables us to rise beyond our ordinariness of being, by giving us potency to achieve things that we otherwise would fall short of achieving, were we to rely only on our natural capacities or strengths. It is true that our bodies, if well cultivated, could become phenomenal juju, enabling us to achieve extraordinary feats. But even such technically trained, programmed or disciplined bodies are likely to encounter challenges that require added potency. In other words, while our bodies have the potential to be our first juju, they eventually require additional juju for us to be efficacious in our actions.

The project consists of three phases: 1. Get 2. Analyse 3. Represent - disseminate. To execute these three phases, we will use the native XML-db application server eXist-db. The XML format used to store and index data is TEI. The choice to use an XML native db and TEI-XML format from the beginning will enable us to extend the metadata collected to the full-text at any time, without facing platform migrations. To publish the results in machine-readable format, to create linked data in the eXist-db API, and to project data in other formats Apache Jena will be used.",
