In examining the artifact and its practices as revealed by interviews, narratives, and manuals, the following questions relating to technicality, instrumentality and creativity in the analog humanities come to light: How is knowledge crafted with a slip-box? What does this apparatus consist of? What is the genealogy of its format and standardization? Why were scholarly index cards resisted or criticized by some and, on the other hand, what made them so eagerly adopted by others? What kinds of humanistic work was recognized as valuable thinking, as opposed to mundane, auxiliary labor? Can index cards affect the style of thinking?

The database comprises nearly 6500 full-text transcribed letters with facsimiles and editorial comments.

To establish a ranking of songs reflecting their contemporary popularity, we approximate early modern hit charts in which the popularity of historical songs is defined as the interaction of several variables that affect the popularity of a song.

After that, we employ different methods of text compression to quantitatively estimate a song's degree of repetitiveness. We use (i) the Shannon entropy, (ii) the Lempel-Ziv-Welch-algorithm (LZW) and (iii) the Bloom Filter.

Using these compression methods as predictors, we model the relationship between popularity and repetition in early modern songs with regression models.","This study explores the relation between repetition and popularity in Dutch historical songs.

The metadata contains 941,302 instances of testimony between 1877 and 1990; it includes information about the witnesses appearing before Congressional committees as well as about the subjects of the hearings. This data is juxtaposed with strike and union density data to suggest that labor has been most consistently represented at Congressional hearings when a) it has engaged in electoral politics and b) it has possessed demonstrable strength in civil society as measured not only by isolated incidents but by consistent penetration. Future work hopes to juxtapose these data sets with actual legislative outcomes; merely being heard does not, after all, necessarily translate into being listened or deferred to. Such juxtapositions could help elucidate whether organizational strength converts to important outcomes as well as presence at hearings.","This paper examines what metadata about Congressional hearings can tell us about shifts in the relative power of workers in American society over time.

Using insights from network theory and narratology, this talks addresses conflicts between two characters (dyads), as well as between three characters (triads). First, a conflict score is introduced through which the more powerful party between two hostile characters can be determined. Second, the amount of social balance between subnetworks of three characters is tested. The results of these two approaches are interpreted in light of existing theories on conflicts in narratives.

Formulated as a policy and risk assessment document, the model is meant to help heritage institutions identify the kinds of future immersive experiences that are supported by our evidence; as well as assess how to develop effective, meaningful content into leading edge inclusive and impactful immersive experiences.",,,,,"Benardou, Agiatis",ATHENA R.C.,Greece,Eastern_Europe, ,a.benardou@dcu.gr,,"Leo.Konstantelos@glasgow.ac.uk, Murray.Pittock@glasgow.ac.uk, a.benardou@dcu.gr, Maria.Economou@glasgow.ac.uk, Lorna.hughes@glasgow.ac.uk","Benardou, Agiatis",a.benardou@dcu.gr,"Dr. Agiatis Benardou is Senior Research Associate at the Digital Curation Unit, ATHENA R.C., Research Associate in Information Studies, University of Glasgow, and Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Informatics, Athens University of Economics and Business.

Most digital archives and scholarly editions offer the traces of a work’s genesis as digitized items, side by side. Instead of such a juxtaposition, this paper proposes a model that enables scholarly editors to discover and record the connections between these textual traces. The ability to record these connections facilitates a more comprehensive understanding of a work’s genesis. This implies a dynamic model that allows users to turn the different genetic traces into the “motion picture” of the genesis. With the proposed model, zooming in on the smallest level of textual change no longer entails the danger of getting lost in the manuscripts thanks to the possibility to zoom out again at every stage in the enquiry and see the bigger picture.","A traditional danger of manuscript research is that the researcher gets lost in the details of the archival material.

Our corpus has three features.

1. Morphological information is annotated for each text.

2. The corpus has two texts, the Roman alphabet text and the Japanese character text.

3. The corpus includes a direct link to the image of the original print from the British Library.

With these features, this corpus not only functions as an index, but also enables more advanced research and statistical analyses in a wide range of fields, including phonetics, grammar, notation research, and so on.

We explain the congruence we have found between debates on consciousness and the currently-dominant understanding within scholarship of digital textuality. Based on three use cases, we then contend that understanding digital text as an emergent property of interconnected knowledge, rather than as a purely semiotic description, creates new affordances for textual scholarship that are complementary to the current status quo of digitally mediated text as mimesis of print culture.","This paper takes up the problem of the ontological status of text in the digital environment to which some attention has been called before (e.g. Van Zundert and Andrews, 2017).

I argue that the digital mode of representation and analysis of symbolic artefacts is 'synesthetic' in that it (a) is able to represent artefacts irrespective of their medial modality and (b) is at base level semiotically impartial, i.e. not invested with ontological, cultural or conceptual preferences. Moreover, (c) its foundation in formalization and abstraction and the alienating effect of these principles in the modeling of symbolic artefacts trigger ‘parekbasis’, i.e. self-reflection.

Against this background DH can, in a history of ideas perspective, be contextualized as methodology resonating with Romantic ideals.

This digital manuscript recovers the significant history of the Southern Life History Project (SLHP) by applying computational methods to analyze the collection. The SLHP was a unique project created under the New Deal in the U.S. to capture the stories over everyday Americans, especially those who had traditionally been marginalized in the historical record. The poster will make explicit the scholarly intervention of the project and then explain how the book’s arguments are being conveyed through digital forms, specifically organized around layers and thick mapping building off of the spatial turn in digital history.","In this poster, we demonstrate how digital texts present a new and unique form of scholarly argumentation that both challenges and extends traditional methods by outlining our framework for a new digital book, Voice of a Nation: Mapping Documentary Expression in New America.

In this paper, we approach these questions with computational methods in one of the first attempts to apply digital methods to animal studies. In a variety of corpora—from popular natural history to scientific writing about animal behavior to animal-driven fictions historically accused of anthropomorphism—we compare the semantic and syntactic footprints left behind by animals and humans. We discover that, from a computational standpoint, animals in fiction are indeed recognizable as characters, albeit characters who register intentionality through physical movement over speech and display a mental paradigm delimited by instinct and associative learning. Natural history writing, on the other hand, narrates animals in ways that seem surprisingly human-like when compared to animal representations in fiction more broadly.","What do animals do in the pages of fiction?

Over the course of the 18th century, the look and purpose of the quotation mark transformed dramatically within the English novel. A survey of genres shows that the novel played a principal role in this development (more than scientific journals, trial transcripts, poetry, and drama). It’s the gradual emergence of a new literary device within a new literary genre—a consequence of the novel’s “new and important role of dialogue” (Lukács). What’s more, the quotation mark led to the conceptual clarification and prominence of “direct discourse,” a necessary step for the emergence of free indirect discourse.","Although it is commonly assumed that the novel emerged during the 18th century, it has proven notoriously difficult to say what exactly was new about this new literary form.

A few examples will illustrate how it operates on three levels: the first is the codex as it is today; the second relates to its historical parts; and the third to their pieces of content.

globalization & digital divides",,"We currently face unprecedented rates of extinction of minority and indigenous languages and scripts, and digital technologies appear to be contributing to their decline. Scholars predict 50-90% of languages will become extinct this century, while only 5% of languages will attain digital vitality. This paper investigates what can be done to close this digital divide through an instrumental case study of Unicode inclusion and the development of supports for the Ethiopic script and its languages, including the national language of Ethiopia. Mixed methods include observation of digital governance institutions, archival research, a content analysis of script and language choices on social media, and interviews with Ethiopic digital pioneers. This paper concludes with recommendations to strengthen supports for digitally-disadvantaged languages, from inclusion in the Unicode Standard, to grassroots coding within and on behalf of digitally-disadvantaged language communities, to advancing the idea that supporting linguistic diversity is Silicon Valley’s corporate social responsibility.

One of the perennial debates related to the problematic raised by computation is that knowledge and its processing is enveloped within a black-boxed structure which obscures or hides the internal workings of the machine. This has implications not just for programmers, but also for those who rely on computational techniques, such as the digital humanities. Moreover, as algorithms continue to penetrate into broader society, major difficulties are raised when important decisions are made which cannot be understood or checked – this has democratic implications. But not only are decisions and the decision-making process often obscured, the form of knowledge and mode of thought itself are often veiled.

Moore thus implicitly, and perhaps intuitively, hypothesized that the critical appreciation of graphic novels and memoirs may have a formal basis. In this paper, we describe the operationalization of Moore’s concept of density with the help of a total of six textual and visual measures. We then present a pilot study of 40 graphic narratives drawn from a larger corpus, six of which can be described as canonical examples of this genre given their frequent discussion in academic scholarship.

Based on a dataset of four Dutch newspapers that span the period 1840-1990, we show how conceptual connections between the members of the MCE trinity are highly restricted. N-gram frequency measures and collocations are employed to map the word usage and, building on recent advancements in diachronic vector semantics, we use word embeddings to study changing relations between modernity, civilization and Europe. These methods show how the trinity is characterized by intermittent and alternating connections, but not by perennial semantic boundaries. Given that these results differ from research based on elite discourse, this paper demonstrates the need for digital research into conceptual interrelationships.

While there is now a wide variety of uses in different fields, many projects highlight the difficulty of bringing graph theory and their discipline into dialogue. Fortunately, the development of accessible software has been accompanied in recent years by a critical reflection on our practices. Yet, it often focuses on technical aspects.

In this paper, we propose to shift this emphasis and address the question of the researcher’s interpretative journey from visualisation to metrics resulting from the network structure. Often addressed in relation to graphical representation, the subjectivity of _translation_ is all the more important when it comes to interpreting structural metrics. This is why this communication will propose to examine the practice of visual reading and metrics-based analysis in a correspondence table that clarifies the translation while presenting possible and generic interpretation scenarios.

The poster explains the relevance of digital source criticism, listing the key questions that should be posed to both analogue and digital sources.

It also presents the core Ranke2 teaching principles:

1. Differentiation in complexity and time required, to connect to different teaching contexts. This means lecturers can choose between the modules SMALL( an animation and/or a quiz), MEDIUM (a series of assignments) or LARGE (a tutorial for a hands on workshop).

2. Offering teaching content in a variety of attractive interactive formats: colourful animations, quizzes, assignments for web research, and tutorials for a hands on workshop.

However, as digital history projects are often criticised for naive and historically laxed approaches to sources resulting in simplification of complex phenomena, such an approach will not hold water. In this paper we demonstrate how proper use of metadata is necessary for serious corpus control and digital source criticism.

This work makes two specific contributions to the history of the book and digital history. First, we present a general methodological approach for creating a historical biographical database out of a bibliographical catalogue. Second, we demonstrate solutions for forming a uniform dataset from a noisy and heterogenous starting point.","With any computational analysis of a large historical dataset, there is a strong temptation to approach the dataset as holistic representation of the language and intellectual landscape of its era.

During the annotation process of these corpora the researcher has to determine the precise time a sign occurs and properly gloss it. Consequently, the annotation process is extremely labor intensive, but a condition for a reliable quantitative analysis of the corpora.

The aim of this project is to develop a tool that automatically annotates the signs and their phonological features in a video. The first part towards automatic annotation is to recognise the exact time-frame a sign occurs. To remove the redundant information from the raw video a pose estimation framework (namely OpenPose) has been used. The extracted hand locations have been used to train four different classifiers. The result of this process is a tool that uses XGBoost to accurately predict the span of a sign and automatically create the annotation slot.

Such projects include long-running infrastructural undertakings, e.g. the municipality boundaries of NLGIS and cadastral maps of HISGIS Netherlands. With the rise of Linked Data in recent years, the field of spatial humanities has gained a strong momentum in the Netherlands by cultural heritage orientated tech-companies creating smart geo-tools.

With the input of four academic institutes, tech-companies, and cultural heritage partners, our aim is to move towards an approachable, national spatial humanities platform, for exchange and collaboration, within and outside the Netherlands. To ensure the latter, the network communicates with existing projects and SIGs around the world for the exchange of infrastructural knowledge, data models and vocabularies, benefitting researchers worldwide.","Over the past decades, the Netherlands has fostered a rich variety of projects in a field we would today refer to as ‘spatial humanities’. Such projects include long-running infrastructural undertakings, e.g. the municipality boundaries of NLGIS and cadastral maps of HISGIS Netherlands. With the rise of Linked Data in recent years, the field of spatial humanities has gained a strong momentum in the Netherlands by cultural heritage orientated tech-companies creating smart geo-tools. Yet, the field is fragmented and there is little coordination regarding best-practices, tools, and vocabularies.

Basing the analysis on the study of the copy from a single hand of several texts can partially be a way around this issue (Camps & Cafiero, 2012), but the limited availability of complete diplomatic transcription might make it difficult. In this paper, we use a workflow combining handwritten text recognition and stylometric analysis, and apply it to the case of the hagiographic works contained in MS BnF, fr. 412. We seek to evaluate Paul Meyer's hypothesis about the constitution of groups of hagiographic works, as well as to examine potential authorial groupings in a vastly anonym corpus.","Stylometric analysis of medieval vernacular texts is still much of a challenge: the importance of scribal variation, be it graphic or more substantial, as well as the variants and errors introduced in the tradition, complicates the task of the would-be stylometrist. Basing the analysis on the study of the copy from a single hand of several texts can partially be a way around this issue (Camps & Cafiero, 2012), but the limited availability of complete diplomatic transcription might make it difficult.

It adopts a machine learning approach to add genre labels to newspaper articles. Classifying genre in a standardized and reliable manner is challenging, though, because genre is a typical example of a ‘latent’ content category, which needs considerable interpretation. To ensure the reliability of the results and to evaluate the machine learning approach, it is crucial to make the methodological impact of various machine learning pipelines transparent. In order to make an informed decision on the right pipeline and understand its inherent biases, we have developed a dashboard that allows the scholar to explore the underlying decision-making process of the machine learning pipeline.

One of the central features of our project was to adopt a continuous integration (CI) system in order to manage the work across these stages in a sensible manner. The primary challenge we then had to overcome was the need to ensure that the data was cleanly maintained from beginning to end, as the nature of CI design does not allow for modifications in the middle of the pipeline. While our implementation of the CI pipeline does not carry us all the way to the finished edition, we believe that this would be a very desirable future direction.

SPEAR shows how a prosopography project can employ TEI, field-specific scholarly standards, and Linked Open Data to produce a highly structured and semantically rich database that maintains close ties to the texts from which it is derived.",,,,,"Schwartz, Daniel L",Texas A&M University,United States of America,North_America, ,daniel.schwartz@tamu.edu,,daniel.schwartz@tamu.edu,"Schwartz, Daniel L.",daniel.schwartz@tamu.edu,"Daniel L.

This article reports on the extraction and analysis of the data contained in “Didot-Bottin” covering the period 1839-1922 for Paris, digitized by the Bibliotheque nationale de France. We process more than 27 500 pages to create a database of 4,2 Million entries linking addresses, person mention and activities. The quality of the document analysis process is assessed diachronically and a conservative strategy was chosen in order to populate the database with only information of high confidence. An initial analysis of the data is presented, reporting on the overall statistics of the distribution of professions in Paris and their evolution during more than 80 years, as well a general overview of the diversity of family names through time. Seven case studies corresponding to different streets are briefly compared, showing how information in city directories capture statistically the dynamics of segmentation of the city into functionality differentiated neighbourhoods.

Implications: The open citation data available is still far from being competitive with well-known proprietary citation databases such as Scopus and Web of Science.

Although natural language is usually employed to convey these, conceptual models have shown to be useful in a number of situations due to reduced ambiguity and ease of implementation on computing platforms.

Within conceptual modelling, however, some areas are still poorly understood and weakly supported by existing technologies. One of these areas is that of “soft issues”, that is, the modelling of issues that are crucial to human understanding, but which have been traditionally regarded as incompatible with or almost intractable by computers. Some examples include the passage of time, the subjective perception of the world, and vagueness.

In this tutorial, we use ConML (www.conml.org) to demonstrate how these issues can be tackled, and how conceptual models can be constructed that express temporality, subjectivity and vagueness. ConML is a conceptual modelling language developed with a special orientation towards the humanities and social sciences, and with the aim that specialists with little or no experience in computer science would be able to learn it and use it in very little time.

The tutorial will employ theoretical explanations combined with hands-on group exercises, a technique that we have been since 2012 in our postgraduate courses on information modelling for the humanities at the University of Santiago de Compostela. Attendees will acquire practical skills to construct expressive models, as well as the theoretical underpinnings supporting them. They will have access to proven modelling techniques as well as new and experimental findings.","Research and practice in the humanities often involve the management of large and complex bodies of information representing objects of study, hypotheses, work in progress or even conclusions.

When considering research processes that involve interview data, we observe a variety of scholarly approaches, that are typically not shared across disciplines. Scholars hold on to engrained research practices drawn from specific research paradigms and they seldom venture outside their comfort zone. The inability to ‘reach across’ methods and tools arises from tight disciplinary boundaries, where terminology and literature may not overlap, or from different priorities placed upon digital skills in research. We believe that offering accessible and customized information on how to appreciate and use technology can help to bridge these gaps.

This workshop aims to break down some of these barriers by offering scholars who work with interview data the opportunity to apply, experiment and exchange tools and methods that have been developed in the realm of Digital Humanities.

Previous work

As a multidisciplinary group of European scholars, tools and data professionals, spanning the fields of speech technology, social sciences, human computer interaction, oral history and linguistics, we are interested in strengthening the position of interview data in Digital Humanities. Since 2016 we have organized a series of workshops, supported by CLARIN on this topic (https://oralhistory.eu).

Our first concrete output was the development of the T-Chain, a tool that supports transcription and alignment of audio and text in multiple languages. Second we developed a format for experimenting with a variety of annotation, text analysis and emotion recognition tools as they apply to interview data.

The workshop

This half-day workshop will provide a fruitful cross-disciplinary knowledge exchange session. It will:
- Use hands-on sessions to explore annotation, text analysis and emotion extraction tools with interview data;
- Test the T-Chain with participants’ own audio-clips;
- Attract open source Speech to Text software developers to expand the number of languages that could be integrated into the T-Chain.

What are our tools and methods-in-use? How do they relate in terms of modeling and epistemological awareness? What functionalities are we missing and would like to have?

The current panorama in DLS presents a plethora of tools, protocols and practices for processing, analyzing and visualizing data. This diversity of practices and tools originating from different areas (e.g., stylometry, NLP, literary studies, corpus linguistics) has resulted in a rich, but atomized situation. To overcome this, there is a need to bring people together and discuss.

Our workshop taps into the DLS Tool Inventory (DLS-TI), a first attempt to gather information on the practices of the various traditions present in DLS. Building on it, the workshop aims at taking stock, but also reflect on, our methods. Four use cases representing different types of digital methods/tools will undergo an “autopsy”: Invited scholars will each present their own use case, by way of applied tool criticism of the associated tool/library/method. They will analyze the use case by a list of criteria: (a) reasons for choosing the method; (b) the method’s impact on the analysis and results; (c) advantages and limitations.

Each use case will be selected to represent a certain group of tools/methods (see below), motivated by (1) significance of the use case with regard to current trends in the field of DLS; (2) diversity in terms of disciplinary area, methodological approach, geographic areas, gender; (3) diversity in terms of tools and approaches (e.g., GUIs vs command line; tools vs libraries or other methods; DLS-specific vs generic).","In the SIG-workshop “DLS Tool Criticism.

Many digital humanists have found that academic cultures can differ widely because cultural factors often weight on the scope and vision of individuals. For this reason, diversity is at the forefront of the Digital Humanities. This workshop aims to make the participants acquainted with different understandings of diversity in different parts of the globe while considering how more diverse teams contribute to the development of our work.

The workshop is directed at anyone with an interest in understanding diversity in digital humanities and creating a welcoming and inclusive DH environment. Conference organizers, leaders in the field, and those who often form part of hiring committees are invited to participate. Everyone is welcome to attend, but we particularly encourage the participation of people who are in privileged positions in academia, GLAM, or similar environments.

The workshop will combine presentations, individual work, and roundtables tackling issues such as:

· The importance of diversity

· Implicit bias

· Cultural cloning

· Intersectionality

· Civil courage

· Strategies for becoming more inclusive

· Effective collaboration across cultures

The workshop will cover gender, ethnic, and linguistic diversity, as well as topics such as ableism, cultural diversity, class, and other matters. The important notion of intercultural communication will also be addressed.

During these conversations and exercises, we will have a particular focus on the digital humanities as a working environment, but many of the strategies might be transposed to other areas or to the projects that we develop as digital humanists.","One of the main characteristics of work in the Digital Humanities is collaboration: between individual scholars with complementary expertise, across disciplines, and across languages, countries, and continents.

The future is firmly in the past, even as we continue to claim and provide for creative innovation. The African tradition of self-extension through creative imagination that privilege cosmologies and ontologies of interconnections in myriad ways, holds great promise for theorising the intersections between humans and ICTs.

Juju as used in this address is a technology of self-activation and self-extension – something that enables us to rise beyond our ordinariness of being, by giving us potency to achieve things that we otherwise would fall short of achieving, were we to rely only on our natural capacities or strengths. It is true that our bodies, if well cultivated, could become phenomenal juju, enabling us to achieve extraordinary feats. But even such technically trained, programmed or disciplined bodies are likely to encounter challenges that require added potency. In other words, while our bodies have the potential to be our first juju, they eventually require additional juju for us to be efficacious in our actions. My address draws on the writings of Amos Tutuola and the universes he depicts to make this argument.","In this address, I liken ICTs or digital technologies to what we in West and Central Africa have the habit of referring to as juju.

The outcome will be the first fully lemmatized digital edition of a medieval French text, with a search page directly linked to one of the principal Old French dictionaries. The project team are editing the two most important manuscript copies of the earliest universal chronicle in French. In addition to publishing the first complete edition of the text, it will provide an extensive corpus (over 350,000 words) of lemmatized and searchable linguistic data. The principal development in the last six months is the integration of the data from lemmatization into the edition’s faceted search page. In addition to reporting on some of the challenges faced during this period, the poster will outline the custom pieces of software developed as part of the overall editorial workflow.

The conceptual model for this catalogue may serve as a model for the study of similar processes in other language regions.
