What does this apparatus consist of? What is the genealogy of its format and standardization? Why were scholarly index cards resisted or criticized by some and, on the other hand, what made them so eagerly adopted by others? What kinds of humanistic work was recognized as valuable thinking, as opposed to mundane, auxiliary labor? Can index cards affect the style of thinking?",

    "text": "Observing poetic similarity is a method in comparative studies of poetry, indicating interrelationship among works and poetic influences among authors  This research explores the poetic similarity between the Irish poet W  B  Yeats and four related English Romantic poets, whose influence can be discerned in Yeats’s poetry  Adopting digital approaches, we build a model to quantitatively analyze the poetic similarity among authors in three aspects: intertextuality, formal elements (including rhyme type, meter style and enjambment), and sentiment  After analyzing 1090 poetic works by Yeats and four English Romantic poets and interpreting the results, we find the poetic similarity between Yeats and Blake to be the most significant, corresponding with previous literary critics’ views and leaving room for further explorations  The research's findings assist previous literary studies and its methods may shed light on further studies concerning Yeats’s complex relationship with Romanticism ",

    "text": "This article discusses some of the possibilities of visualization and representation of historical events that are associated with repression against the Volga Germans in the USSR during the Second World War  In particular, special attention is paid to the role of historical electronic maps and the use of geo-information technologies in the preservation of historical memory   At present, issues of ethnic and political repression in the USSR are studied rather fragmentary, both in Russia and in Europe as a whole  Today, the problem of repression against the Volga Germans has two aspects, firstly, necessary the direct study of repressive practices, deportation processes and secondly, preservation of the memory of victims of repression, the creation of dialogue in society  Achieving these goals is impossible without the use of information technology, especially when it comes to preserving memory and representing historical events in public space ",

    "text": "This paper will introduce a frame of reference for understanding fundamental challenges that inform digital humanities as an interdisciplinary research area between arts, humanities, information and computer science  Its conclusions are based upon the evidence found in a corpus of 38 linked interviews about big data research, developed within an EU-funded collaboration known as Knowledge Complexity, or KPLEX for short (www kplex-project eu)  When viewed from the perspective of the digital humanities, six distinct points of ‘aporia’ with a significant impact on DH appear in this corpus, places where the interviewees explicitly or tacitly expose gulfs in epistemic culture that are clearly at the heart of tensions between disciplines as they seek to collaborate  This paper will explore these areas of apparent irreconcilability, and conclude with a series of reflections on how digital humanities researchers might develop to become uniquely able to negotiate some of these critical conversations ",
